    "1 \n \nBook Review 11: July 2017  \n    Agricultural Extension in South Asia \n \n \nAGRICULTURAL EXTENSION IN KERALA:  \nA SERVICE DELIVERY FRAMEWORK \nDr. P Rajasekharan and Dr. C. Bhaskaran (2017),  \nKerala State Planning Board \nTrivandrum, Kerala, India \n \n \n \nExtension delivery system in Kerala is unique as it operates in a socio-economic and agrarian milieu that is \nquite different from the rest of the country, with a few elements that can be showcased globally as well. This has evolved along with the transitions in the agricultural sector in the state, which has witnessed \nseveral shifts in emphases. Quite possibly, these changes also reflect the direction in which the state’s \nprimary section moves on. Growth pattern of agriculture in Kerala has been disturbing, with almost \nconsistent downward trends in area and production. While productivity has shown increasing trends in \nalmost all crops, profitability has been changing in response to the several externalities on which neither \nthe state nor the farmers have had any sway. Needless to say, various parameters of agricultural growth \nshow that the primary sector had been going through a phase of irreversible downturn, with the proportion \nof people involved in agriculture and the contribution to the state’s GDP decreasing day by day. Though this \nis in line with the national trends, the transition in Kerala has been drastic and fast.",
    "Though this \nis in line with the national trends, the transition in Kerala has been drastic and fast. How has the extension delivery system, structurally and \nfunctionally, responded to these changes? Has it ever been able \nto influence the trajectory of this transition in any manner \nwhatsoever? Or is it that the extension system is always \ninvariably led by the changes in the external environment? How \npowerful and effective are the interventions by an extension \nsystem in slowing down this trend, if not reverse it? Has the \nextension delivery system changed itself to take on these \nemerging challenges? It appears that the extension system can \nbe viewed in two ways: one, as a self-evolving system in \nresponse to the greater external changes or two, as a tool to \nsafeguard the concerns of the actors by minimising the impact \nof changes. Documenting the features of an extension system \nwould require deeper and precise analysis of either one or both \nof these perspectives. Any historiographical description of the \ntransition of agricultural extension should necessarily consider \nthese concerns as it is important not only to understand the \ndrivers of such changes, but also to design new strategies to \ninfluence them as much as possible.",
    "Kerala has a rather different paradigm \nof development, mainly anchored on equitable redistribution of public resources and supported by the \nprosperity created by remittance by migrants who are employed in the Middle East and other regions \nglobally. The fact that the socio-economic development of Kerala has not been triggered by the growth in \nthe productive sector, explains why agriculture has turned out to be a less important livelihood option. Agriculture, which had already been weakened by such changes, was further threatened by the onslaught \nof globalisation, with several multilateral agreements and policy changes impacting its growth \nretrogressively. Unregulated competition, price volatility and decreasing profitability have aggravated the \ncrisis in the agricultural sector, forcing several farmers to seek new alternate options. There is a clear and succinct review of these changes by analysing the trends of agricultural growth since \n1960 and comparing it with the trends at the national level. An overview of agriculture in Kerala, presents a \nsummary of the core issues in this sector. Skewed cropping pattern with emphasis on cash crops and \ndrastic reduction of food crops, marginalization of holdings, price volatility, increase in cost of cultivation \nand declining livestock population have been identified as major issues. Figures relevant to Kerala have \nbeen judiciously used to illustrate the temporal pattern of changes in agriculture, which would help us \nunderstand the scenario better.",
    "The authors have also tried to come up with a few indicators that would \ndescribe the nature of agriculture in the state more vividly. The extension delivery framework for the state is contextualized by a systematic and concise review of the \norigin and evolution of extension as a discipline and praxis. In fact, extension science as a discipline that \nwould help provide solutions to development problems through conscientization as defined by A W van \nden Ban has changed in terms of form and purpose over a few decades. The book rightly observes that \nextension approaches have changed according to the preferences of the funding agencies and the \n3 \n \nimmediate requirements of times. For instance, as the authors observe, extension during the 20th century \nhas been centrally funded and top down in structure with the TOT model being increasingly replaced by \nparticipatory approaches. However, the theoretical underpinnings of these changes do not seem to have \nbeen explored in detail. I would love to believe that this omission has happened for fear of the enormous \nmagnitude of the topic. These minor deliberate omissions notwithstanding, the book has brilliantly illustrated the diverse extension \nsystems in developing economies and tried to relate the inferences to the emerging institutional \narrangements for extension service delivery.",
    "Finding out a typology of extension service delivery based on \ndifferent places and historical phases is quite interesting; as it would possibly prompt an avid observer to \ngo deeper into the historical contexts of the transitions in agricultural extension. Equally noteworthy is the \nhistorical description of the extension initiatives in India during the pre and post-independence periods. Though they are not exhaustively explained, it gives the reader a bird’s eye view of the series of \ndevelopmental interventions that have shaped up the paradigm of agricultural development in the country. However, a student of extension history would like to know the logic of the evolution of development \ninitiatives based on the learning from previous experiences. The progression of extension initiatives from the Economic Conference of Mysore (1914-18) to Etawah Pilot \nProject (1948) shows how the development perspectives, approaches and tools have changed during the \npre-independence period and how they have contributed to the strategies of agricultural and rural \ndevelopment in independent India. Sad to say, the dynamics of this change in relation to the political \ntransition in India has not been seriously understood by extensionists. However, the authors present the \nsequel to the development narrative of yesteryears, by briefly explaining the current initiatives, which are \nhuge by scale and triggered by multiple agencies and actors.",
    "Similarly, the history and evolution of \nagricultural development and extension in Kerala has also been documented with rich evidences drawn \nfrom a wide range of authentic sources. Though the authors have exercised great caution in documenting \nthe major historical milestones chronologically, emphasis seems to have been given to agriculture in the \nsouthern part of the state alone, with brief explanations of the contributions of some prominent rulers of \nTravancore. An account of similar interventions in Cochin and Malabar regions has not found a place in this \nsection. It is against this exhaustively drawn up background, that the authors examine the extension delivery system \nin Kerala. The compilation of agricultural development and extension initiatives in Kerala across the twelve \nfive year plans has turned out to be an exhaustive collection; a sure delight for any student of the \ndevelopment history of Kerala. Each five year plan has witnessed the design and implementation of a few \ndevelopment programmes reflecting the perspectives, concerns and priorities of the plan. It is an invaluable \nand unprecedented documentation as far as Kerala’s development history is concerned. This lengthy \nsection carefully examines the extension interventions in the past with a focus on the critical factors of \n©George K Mathai  \nPeople’s representatives play a very important role in agricultural development in \nKerala. A scene from Onamthuruthu padashekaram under Neendur Krishi Bhavan \n4 \n \ntheir success or failure.",
    "A scene from Onamthuruthu padashekaram under Neendur Krishi Bhavan \n4 \n \ntheir success or failure. Alongside, the logic of establishing new institutional mechanisms to sustain the \npositive outcomes of past systems has also been explained convincingly. The authors’ narrative on \nintegrating the positive elements of the Training and Visit (T&V) system and a few other externally funded \nprojects during that period into the new paradigm of ‘integrated development and extension’ at the \ngrassroots level (by means of establishing an exclusive ‘Krishibhavan’ in every gram panchayat) is a telling \nexample of the continuity and coherence of ideas maintained throughout the book. Transition of an existing paradigm to a much evolved new system as signified in the collapse of the T&V \nsystem provides us with several lessons on the need to design new institutional arrangements for extension \ndelivery. The interactivity between extension agency and farming community had increased in the T&V \nsystem, but it was not necessarily participatory in its approach. It was in this very place, Krishibhavan was \nprospectively established as the hub of agricultural development in a gram panchayat, expecting greater \nintensity of contact with farmers, participation of stakeholders and adoption of group approaches in \nresource management. The uniqueness of this system is its organisational setup; which includes an \nAgricultural Officer, who is compulsorily a graduate in agriculture, leading a small team of three agricultural \ndemonstrators.",
    "Assistant Director of Agriculture Mr George K Mathai (Ettumanoor Block) with Agricultural Officer Smt.Arya .V.C \nand her team of Agricultural Assistants (Smt. Sabitha, Smt. Aswathy and Sri. Rajeesh)  \nand Mrs.Abitha, Block Technology Manager, ATMA \n \nKrishibhavans, since their inception in 1987, played a pivotal role in supporting agricultural development in \nthe state. These institutions have grown into the primary referral points of the farmers for access to \ninformation, inputs as well as services. Over a period of three decades, the roles of Krishibhavans have \nmultiplied, with several programmes designed around this hub. Of all these changes, introduction of \ndecentralized planning programme consequent to the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments had been \nthe most significant one, which radically transformed these institutions functionally. It is hailed as a unique \ninstitutional arrangement to facilitate planning of development programmes at the local level, with \nmandatory supply of funds, transfer of development agencies and redeployment of personnel to the three \ntier local self-government institutions. An ardent student of development history of Kerala, however, would \nexpect something more. Analysis of the functional and administrative changes brought about by \ndecentralization and its implication on extension delivery could have been elaborated further, as it would \nhave given more insights on the nuances of participatory planning and development envisaged in \ndemocratic decentralization.",
    "Still, the section on the history and evolution of agricultural development and \nextension in Kerala is lucidly written, with incisive description of ATMA programmes and various other \ninterventions designed and customised at the behest of the State Planning Board, to strengthen the \n©George K Mathai  \n5 \n \nextension service delivery in Kerala. These programmes are aptly described by the authors as alternate \nmodel of extension beyond T&V system and ATMA. The book showcases the context and evolution of the prestigious LEADS (Lead farmer centred extension \nadvisory and delivery services) programme, which has attracted national attention as a hybrid version of \nthe constructive components of several previous experiments in extension service delivery. Undoubtedly, \nthe success of LEADS as an approach and strategy deserves to be explored further by extension experts in \nthe country. The programme acknowledges the significance of reaching out to farmers more intensely \nthrough peer group dynamics and addressing specific issues by providing customised solutions. It also \nenvisages providing support to farmers viz. credit linkage, periodic review of field problems by Monthly \nTechnical Advice (MTA) sessions, conscientization through demonstrations, etc. The most important and conspicuous outcome of this intervention had been the evolution of ATMA PLUS, \nan institutional arrangement to overcome the limitations of ATMA. The need to customize ATMA by \nconsidering state level characteristics had been a long standing demand by many extension scientists and \npolicy thinkers.",
    "The need to customize ATMA by \nconsidering state level characteristics had been a long standing demand by many extension scientists and \npolicy thinkers. As the authors argue, funds from ATMA had been grossly inadequate to meet the specific \nrequirements of the state. ATMA PLUS has rendered ATMA more effective by adding new mandates and \nadditional funds for forming groups, mobilising resources and creating innovative learning situations at the \nfield level. More importantly, this approach also involves formulation of location specific development \nprogrammes under the aegis of local self-governments, enabling seamless integration with decentralized \nplanning. About 60% of the total enterprises established by Kudumbasree  \n(State Poverty Eradication Mission, Kerala) are in the livestock sector. The book is to be lauded specifically for attempting a review of the impact of extension services in Kerala. The book also explains the good extension practices followed in ATMA and SAMETI, many components of \nwhich are worth emulating elsewhere. It is heartening that the authors have seriously addressed the issue \nof continuing agricultural education for various stakeholders, by brilliantly presenting the need to enhance \nthe capability of the extension work force to take on new challenges. The list of core competencies \nrequired by extension professionals in the state and the institutional arrangements for imparting them are \ngoing to be eye openers for administrators.",
    "By the way, this would also remind the reader of the need to \ninclude new domains and methodologies of extension research that is much required to provide theoretical  \nsupport to the practitioners of this ‘new’ paradigm of extension. The book does not leave out this concern \neither. Surprisingly, though not very deep and exhaustive, the book in its eleventh chapter gives clear \ntheoretical perspectives on emerging challenges in agricultural extension in Kerala. This chapter gives a few \nindications of the prospects of trying out market led extension, issues and implications of privatizing \nextension and linking smallholders with value chain. These observations would, in all likelihood, be \nprophetic; as agriculture in Kerala is geared to try out several such innovations as a means to survive and \nsustain. ©Sreeram Vishnu \n6 \n \nThere is also an elaborate description of the ICT initiatives in agricultural extension, developed by various \nagencies in Kerala to support extension service delivery. As an appropriate and out-and-out conclusion to \nthe logic and narration followed in the book, a progressive phase of the evolution of extension is deftly \npresented as a new framework and model of agricultural extension and service delivery in Kerala, in the \nconcluding chapter. Termed as ASDP (Agricultural Extension and Service Delivery Project), this new project \nis envisaged as a comprehensive strategy, addressing all major concerns, pertinent to Kerala’s agriculture.",
    "The proposed model includes natural resource management, credit linkage, diagnostic services, market \nlinkage, social capital, mechanisation, input supply, eco-friendly and sustainable management of crops, etc, \nas spokes of the central theme of agricultural extension services. But quite convincingly, the prospects of \nemploying this new model are not grounded on any unrealistic notions. It is firmly based on the \nexperiences drawn from the successful cases and pilot programmes implemented across the state. Details \nof these cases are presented vividly, though they are brief and crisp. Illustrating the efficacy of these cases \nseemed refreshing. Finally, what is the impression left behind? Comprehending the innumerable dimensions of the complex \nprocess of extension delivery has been attempted with an air of ease and élan. The book is a treasure house \nof new insights on extension service delivery in changing times. This is not only because of the compilation \nof even the subtle details of these new experiments, but also on account of the objectivity in drawing \ninferences and the invigorating style in which they are presented. Unlike the usual genre of books in \nextension, this goes down to the finer details of extension praxis, in a different socio-economic and political \nmilieu. It touches upon every relevant thing in the framework of extension service delivery and does not \nleave out anything.",
    "Skewed cropping pattern with emphasis on cash crops and \ndrastic reduction of food crops, marginalization of holdings, price volatility, increase in cost of cultivation \nand declining livestock population have been identified as major issues.

    "The state has put in place an \nelaborate network of policies and institutions to maintain and indeed promote agrobiodiversity in \nthe state. The present paper undertakes a detailed review of these by evaluating the policies and \nlaws that impact on agrobiodiversity either positively or negatively. It further considers the role of \npublic research institutes that generate the requisite knowledge for maintaining biodiversity and the \ncases of a number of local self-governments which have been successful in promoting \nagrobiodiversity. The public research institutes and nongovernmental organizations have played an \nimportant role in not just generating newer plant varieties and but also play a very important role \nin conserving existing varieties. Based on the analysis, the study identifies a number of \nresearchable issues that may be taken up in future, which will essentially contribute to the \nmanagement of and mainstreaming of agrobiodiversity in the state. The ensuing analysis shows that \nwhile the state has a number of exemplary policies, laws and practices, its success at the level of \nlocal self-governments depends crucially on whether agrobiodiversity is tied to the livelihood \nstrategies of ordinary people. Further, it also depends on the presence of certain key mentors or \ncharismatic leaders within the local self-governments who can make a crucial difference. Merely \nrelying on institutional forms such as Biodiversity Management Committees and People’s \nBiodiversity Registers are unlikely to produce the desired results.",

Pascual et al.",
    "Pascual et al. (2011: 191) use \ndifferent sources to provide a more formal definition as follows: \n \n‗Agrobiodiversity can be understood as the diversity within and among species found in \nan agro-ecosystem that contribute to food and agriculture, including planned \n(domesticated) biodiversity (i.e., the diversity of crops and livestock genetic resources), \nas well as all other plant and animal genetic resources (i.e. crop wild relatives)’. In general, a higher level of diversity could be useful on three counts. There are three kinds of \nvalues of agrobiodiversity. First is the use-value – some of the diverse variety of flora, fauna and \ngenes could be directly useful for people (including cultivators). For example, there could \ndifferent plants and animals that cultivators sustain as a source of subsistence or income. The \nagro-diversity might have served the function of a portfolio diversification to address risks in \nless developed societies which do not have formal institutions for insurance or risk minimisation \n(Kontoleon et al., 2009). In addition, there could be specific uses too. For example, there could \nbe some plants in farms that may have a medicinal use for human beings or animals; there could \nbe some others which can be used as organic or natural pesticides, and so on. All these are part \nof use-values. Second is the option value.",
    "All these are part \nof use-values. Second is the option value. Though some of the varieties are not known to be \nuseful with the current information, some of these may turn out to be useful based on future \nknowledge. Hence there is a value in protecting it currently, even if these are not useful based on \nthe current knowledge. The use of the genes in traditional or wild varieties of grains for \nenhancing the pest resistance of hybrid ones is an example in this regard. Third, there are also \nwhat can be called non-use values. Certain varieties though may not be useful currently or in \nfuture due to the availability of substitutes, may have certain heritage value. We may want our \nfuture generations to have a glimpse or exposure to such entities or practices which require \nthese. However, there is a need for a collective or state action for the protection of agrobiodiversity. Individuals (including the owners of land) may not have adequate incentives to protect agro-\nbiodiversity. There could be a shift in agricultural production towards less diverse (sometime \nmonocrop) systems. In certain cases, the productivity (in terms of the market value) of mono-\ncrop (or less diverse) system could be higher especially when some of the useful attributes of a \ndiverse crop system may not have an appropriate market.",
    "Or the absence or thinness of market \nfor certain products may aggravate the situation. For example, the absence of a market for hay \nencourages farmers to use shorter varieties of paddy or wheat. The economic attractiveness of \nless-diverse versus more-diverse farming systems depends on agro-ecological and market \nconditions. Though there are an option and non-use values, each farmer may not internalise these in his/her \ndecision on the use of agrobiodiversity. This too, can create a situation where the agro-\nbiodiversity through the aggregation of private choices may not be adequate to meet the overall \nsocial requirement in this regard. Or there could be a mismatch between the private conservation \ncosts and wider social benefits or the latter cannot be captured by private conservationists \n(Bellon, 2004). In other words, the conservation of agro-biodiversity has positive externalities, \nand the full benefits of these cannot be captured without state and/or collective action (Friis-\nHansen, 1999). All these are part of the `market failure‘. However, there can be government \nfailures too. Some of the policies and programs of the government, instead of protecting agro-\n \n 7 \n \n \n \nbiodiversity, may lead to its decline unintentionally. This could be due to the non-consideration \nof the impact of these policies and programs on agro-biodiversity.",
    "This could be due to the non-consideration \nof the impact of these policies and programs on agro-biodiversity. Subsidies provided as part of \ngovernment schemes for the promotion of agriculture can distort private incentives to protect \nagro-biodiversity (Perrings, 2001). The breeding programs of the research organisations may \nfavour the establishment of less-diverse farming systems (Gruere et al., 2009). For all these \nreasons; there is a need for informed collective and state actions for the protection of agro-\nbiodiversity. Such a collective action can be at different levels and also facilitated by \ngovernmental and non-governmental organisations and concerned individuals. There has been an increase in the awareness of the need to protect agro-biodiversity globally and \nalso within countries like India. This has encouraged the national and state governments to take \ndifferent steps for this purpose. However, the effectiveness of these steps depends on a number \nof contextual factors. There are studies which assess the effectiveness of such policies and \nprograms in different contexts (for example, Nagarajan et al., 2007; Smale et al., 2008). This \nreport assesses the effectiveness of the institutions (laws), programmes, and organisations to \nconserve agrobiodiversity in the Indian state of Kerala.",
    "According to FAO6, experience and research have shown that agrobiodiversity can:  \nIncrease productivity, food security, and economic returns \nReduce the pressure of agriculture on fragile areas, forests and endangered species \nMake farming systems more stable, robust, and sustainable \nContribute to sound pest and disease management \nConserve soil and increase natural soil fertility and health \nContribute to sustainable intensification \nDiversify products and income opportunities \n Reduce or spread risks to individuals and nations \n Help maximize effective use of resources and the environment \n Reduce dependency on external inputs \n Improve human nutrition and provide sources of medicines and vitamins, and \n Conserve ecosystem structure and stability of species diversity. Kerala is one of the most biodiverse states in the country. It is home to several kinds of flora and \nfauna and is situated in one of the 36-biodiversity hotspots, in the world, namely the Western \nGhats.The people in the State grow 142 crop plants belonging to 104 genera and 43 families \n(Nayar, 2011). Kerala is implementing the central Biological Diversity (BD) Act, 2002 and its Rules 2004, \nthrough state-level BD Rules, 2008. There is a State Biodiversity Board (SBB), and the SBB has \nbeen establishing Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) in all the Local Self \nGovernment (LSGs) beginning with the year 2008. By 2015, it managed to form BMCs in all its \nLSG Units.",
    "By 2015, it managed to form BMCs in all its \nLSG Units. A report of the working group on biodiversity set up by the KeralaState Planning \nBoard has recommended a comprehensive Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan with funding \nfor the 13th Five Year Plan (Kerala State Planning Board, 2017). The report advocates a \nparticipatory management system for the protection of fragile ecosystems such as hills and \nmountains, shola forests, laterite hills, mangroves, sacred groves and riparian habitats, and eco-\nrestoration of degraded areas like abandoned quarries and ponds. The committee has \n                                                                 \n6See  ‗What is agrobiodiversity?‘,http://www.fao.org/3/y5609e/y5609e01.htm (accessed on July 8, 2019) \n \n 8 \n \n \n \nrecommended mobile apps and crowd sourcing for ecosystem mapping. Local bodies have also \nbeen charged with the management of invasive species.Further, the committee has recommended \nthe preparation of a city biodiversity index for Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, and Kozhikode, \nafforestation of public land in urban areas, eco-restoration of water bodiesand establishment of \nbiodiversity parks. All these go on the way towards mainstreaming biodiversity in general at the \nstate. Regarding agrobiodiversity, the working group recommended 14 suggestions 7 .",
    "Regarding agrobiodiversity, the working group recommended 14 suggestions 7 . These \nrange from development of village level seed bank and a seed management committee, \nmaintaining  agrobiodiversity inventory at LSG level through PBR, maintenance of databases \nrelated to Traditional Knowledge, promotion of studies on diversity of natural pollinators and \npredators in the agroecosystem, more attention on the underutilized species as tubers, green leafy \nvegetables, revitalization of organic farming by employing the provisions of Participatory \nGuarantee Scheme (PGS), conservation of local varieties, encouraging boundary bund planting \nin paddy fields, rubber and coconut plantations etc. The Planning Board is in the process of \nimplementing these suggestions. The megafloods in several parts of Kerala in August 2018 seemed to have seriously affected the \nbiodiversity of the state. The post-flood biodiversity impact study conducted by KSBB (Kerala \nState Biodiversity Board, 2018)has drawn up a three-pronged strategy to address the impact of \nthe floods on the ecology and biodiversity of the State. The rapid assessment is to be followed by \na chain study to understand how the disaster has affected various ecosystems. The third part of \nthe strategy will focus on developing a long-term action plan for ecological restoration. Chapter \n4 of the study documents the district-wise impact of mega floods and landslides on \nagrobiodiversity. The crop worst affected was paddy across 12 of the 14 districts.",
    "The crop worst affected was paddy across 12 of the 14 districts. Overall in \nboth India and Kerala, the share of agriculture in the nation and state‘s economy has been \ndeclining. Objectives,  methodology and data sources \nThe primary purpose of the study is to understand the policies and that institutions that Kerala \nstate and India has put in place to successfully manage and conserve agrobiodiversity in the \nstate. It also aims at identifying policy area which needs further careful attention and research. The study employs a mix of primary and secondary source material. Primary sources include a \ndetailed survey of major public research institutions in the state which generate the formalised \nknowledge for maintaining agrobiodiversity . It has also covered some of the leading NGOs in \nthe field. Further, we have surveyed some of the model BMCs in the state. Secondary source \nmaterials include a critical analysis of major policy documents dealing with agrobiodiversityboth \nin a direct and indirect manner. Organisation of the study  \nThe paper is structured into six sections. Section 1 discusses the main institutional mechanism \nthat is available for maintaining biodiversity in general and agrobiodiversity in particular at the \nlevel. This is basically the Biodiversity Management Committees and the People‘s Biodiversity \nRegisters (PBRs). Section 2 evaluates the various laws policies that favour or hinder \nagrobiodiversity in the state.",
    "Such local-level registers of information about varieties \nareseen as an instrument to protect agrobiodiversity globally (Smale et al., 2004). Although in \nKerala tribal communities have their own institutional arrangements for managing \nagrobiodiversity (Padmanabhan, M, 2011). Her study documented collective efforts to halt \ngenetic erosion in the state by looking at four case studies on institutional innovations in \nagrobiodiversity management and analyzing their performance from the perspective of gender \nequity. Negotiation over gendered rules is at the centre of this analysis. However, her study was \nconducted during the mid-2000s when BMCs and PBRs were yet to take shape. PBRs document local community knowledge of status, uses, history, ongoing changes and forces \ndriving changes in biodiversity resources, gainers and losers in these processes and people's \nperceptions of how these resources should be managed. A number of PBRs have been prepared \nin different parts of India beginning 1995 through initiatives of NGOs and educational \ninstitutions working with local communities and village councils. These attempts have been \nmotivated by a desire to promote decentralised systems of management of natural resources and \nto create the basis for equitable sharing of benefits of commercial utilisation of local \ncommunityknowledge of uses of biodiversity. Kerala has one of the best records with respect to \npreparation of PBRs as about 85 per cent of the BMCs have prepared PBRs. See Table 1.",
    "See Table 1. According to the Kerala State Biodiversity Board (KSSB), all the LSGs having BMCs are \nrequired to prepare the PBRs. As per G.O.(Rt.) 2945/2013/LSGD dated 30.11.2013, the State \nGovernment has accorded sanction to incur an expenditure of Rs.1.25 lakhs for grama \npanchayats, Rs. 2.5 lakhs for municipalities and Rs.5 lakhs for corporations from the general \nsector development fund of the annual plan or own general-purpose fund for PBR preparation. It \nis mandatory, and all LSGs having BMCs are required to utilise this fund and complete the PBR \npreparation before 31.3.2017. Nevertheless, according to the KSSB (as on July 11, 2019)60 local self-governments are yet to \nprepare PBRs. The maximum numbers of panchayats not having prepared PBRs so far are in the \ndistricts of Palghat with 25 and Malappuram with 14, followed with Trichur 9, Kannur 9, \nKozhikode, Kottayam and Trivandrum with 1 each.All the other 7 districts have all their local \nself-governments preparing their respective PBRs. This means that Kerala now (July 11, 2019)  \nhas the highest PBR rate at 94.19 per cent.

    " There is a need to strategize the protection of biodiversity.How?  Given the broad climatic characteristics of the state, the same plant species or variety \nmay be prevalent in multiple locations. Some ofthese may be useful to individuals and \nhouseholds, and hence they mayhave the incentive to conserve it.  However, private incentives may not be that high to conserve all kinds ofplants, species \nand genetic diversity (and that is the need for publicintervention in the form of the \nprovision of subsidies or regulations).  There is a resource-cost in both the provision of subsidies and also regulation. It is not \nclear whether such costs are estimated, and whether provisions are made to allocate \npublic resources for this purpose.   The attempt seems to be a wishful effort to protect agro-biodiversity in all places \nwherever these are available. This may not be a realistic target.   If the enforcement effort of the state is going to be targeted to all such localities, then it \nmay get diluted, and there could be land-use changes that may destroy biodiversity in \nmany localities.  It may be noted that agrobiodiversity prevails mostly in private lands, and the reach of \nthe state is limited in such lands compared to forests which are owned by the \ngovernment.

In that sense, the connection between the \n                                                                 \n8Cotton is grown in a small area in Attappadi  in Palghat district. 13 \n \n \n \nprotection of agrobiodiversity and organic farming is envisaged before the formulation of this \npolicy. The policy was proposed and initiated by the KSBB.  Though the preamble of the policy is written in a severely non-rigorous manner, it has \ncertain positive implications for the protection of agrobiodiversity in Kerala.  The policy notes the reality that the intensity of inorganic agriculture in Kerala is not that \nhigh, and hence has the potential to move towards organic farming. Further, the policy \nnotes `the positive side of agriculture in Kerala in terms of the already low levels of \nconsumption of hazardous chemicals and, therefore, chances of redeeming farmers to \norganic agriculture are quite high‘ (p.5). The fact that farmers in Kerala use less \npesticides and other chemicals in growing crops make them much more amenable for \nshifting to organic farming than farmers elsewhere.",
    " In the policy, a farmer is defined as 'Organic Farmer' `provided he/she adheres to and \npractices the following three essentialities of organic farming: (1) a farmer who practices \nmixed farming including food crops; (2) a farmer who ensures the conservation of soil \nand water; (3) a farmer who conserves the biodiversity of the farmland‘. This has \ninteresting implications such as  \no The conventional idea of avoiding chemical fertilizers and pesticides as the core-\nfocus of organic farming is given less importance here \no The definition of organic farming itself is connected to the preservation of \nagrobiodiversity.  The following strategies of organic farming policy can, in principle, help the \nconservation of agro-biodiversity \no Ensure seed sovereignty of the farmers and the State \no Strengthen soil and ensure water conservation measures (by following organic \napproaches) \no Promote a mixed farming approach for livelihood security and ecological \nsustainability \no Conserve and improve agrobiodiversity and undomesticated biodiversity \no Ensure availability of quality organic manure to the farmers \no Develop Model Sustainable Organic Farms in the State \n \n Model organic farms (to be) developed by the state as part of the organic farming policy \ncan be used for the in-situ and live conservation of agro-biodiversity in different agro-\nclimatic zones of Kerala.",
    " On the other hand, the organic farming policy in its present form has a number of \nlimitations, and these may affect the achievement of the goal of protecting \nagrobiodiversity too.  It has not analyzed the economic incentives of the farmers to move towards \norganic farming policy \n It has not outlined the ways by which the state has to encourage farmers to move \ntowards organic farming overriding the economic incentives, if any, to continue \nwith non-organic farming.  It has not assessed the costs that the government has to bear in facilitating the \nshift towards an organic policy.  It has not outlined the administrative mechanisms beyond outlining the nature of a \nstate-level committee for the purpose. 14 \n \n \n \n There could be a case where bio-diversity enhancing farming may become economically \nadvantageous for certain farmers in Kerala. This is when we consider the opportunity \ncost of family labour, including that is needed for the supervision of farm operations. This is so since the conventional (chemical and mono-crop) agriculture may become \neconomically unviable due to the increase in the cost of labour or the opportunity cost of \nfamily labour. Hence a Low External Input and Sustainable Agriculture (LEISA) may \nbecome the default option for a set of farmers.  The organic farming policy has not analysed the existing state and central policies in \nagriculture that may work against the shift towards organic farming.",
    "These may include \nthe subsidies for fertilizers. Some of these policies cannot be changed by the state \ngovernment. Certain policies that prevail at the national level (say subsidy for fertilizers) \nmay benefit Kerala too since it has to import food grains from other states which practice \nchemical agriculture. These ambiguities may reduce the effectiveness of an organic \nfarming policy within Kerala and hence may work against the shift towards an agro-\nbiodiversity enhancing agriculture within the state.   The shift towards an organic farming policy also depends on the consumers or buyers of \nagricultural products. The analysis of this aspect and the strategies required in this \ndomain are weak in the policy. It sees farming mostly from the perspective of supply. This is problematic when we see that a major part of the consumption of agricultural \nproducts within Kerala is imported from other states. There may be a possibility of \ndeveloping an interest among Kerala consumers in organic products, but that may not be \nadequate. It may be that a part of the organic production in Kerala should be able to meet \nthe needs of national/international markets. (In fact, the integration of Kerala‘s \nagriculture with the national and global markets is much higher compared to that of other \nstates, and this has been the situation historically, and not due to the current phase of \nglobalization.)",
    "The policy was designed in such a fashion that each district principal agriculture officers should \nidentify the blocks and each blocks are given target of  area to be cultivated. Thereafter, the \nagriculture officer of the area was given the responsibility to initiate local action plans. Though it \nwent fairly well for quite some time the regime change drastically altered the policy direction. Ultimately the financial allocations were moved from the district development blocks to \nKasaragod district in the context of endosulfan calamities 9 . The entire course of this \ndevelopment shows the dysfunctional characteristics of the state machinery, because the agency \nthat had undertaken the organic farming responsibility in Kasaragod district ended up returning \nthe fund because they failed to fulfil the targets. Interestingly, the government seem to be \ninterested in entrusting organic farming responsibility to private agencies rather than to state \nagencies, which are comparatively efficient, well-organised and regularly monitored. The \ncurrent regime aims to involve agricultural university in the entire policy implementation. In \nshort, the only time period the policy was implemented in the last ten years is merely nineteen \nmonths‖.10 Expert views reveals the crucial fact that contrary to its flamboyance, such policies \nare  always connected to the vigor and interest of the incumbent as well as successive regimes  \n                                                                 \n9Kasaragod district in Kerala shot into global attention in the late nineties  due to use of endosulfan—a  highly toxic \npesticide—in cashew nut plantations.",

As far as considering the certified organic farming area in Kerala, an organic farmers‘ directory \nhas been prepared by the Farm Information Bureau of department of agriculture and farmers‘ \nwelfare, government of Kerala.

    "It is mentioned in only one place. (Policy 245: Kerala is \nhaving a well-defined policy on 'Organic Farming', and on this light, organic pesticides are to be \nmade freely available, and the recent technology developed by CTCRI needs an intensified \nproduction.) The focus of the latter seems to be on the mainstream input-intensive agriculture. This shows how different policies can be at cross-purposeswith respect to mainstreaming \nagrobiodiversity. Most of the policy statements in Kerala Agricultural Development Policy, 2015, are wish \nstatements, without thinking about the costs and mechanisms for their enforcement. 2.5. Laws on Intellectual Property Rights \nAnother policy having a bearing on agrobiodiversity is the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) \nPolicy of the state. This policy is formulated in consonance with the provisions of the Indian \nPatents Act and the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. However, the focus is on what it calls \n`traditional knowledge‘. The main purpose of the policy is to create legal property rights on such \nknowledge to avoid `misappropriation‘ by corporate and capitalist enterprises and can lead to the \ncreation of a knowledge commons. We need to think theoretically about the potential of such a \n`legal right‘ on traditional knowledge on the conservation of agrobiodiversity. It may be better to \ncompare a `with‘ and `without‘ situation here.",
    "The policy also gives a strong role to the SBB. Such access to larger markets may enhance the incentives to use traditional knowledge and \nhence preserve agro-biodiversity (as long as it is required for the use of such knowledge).",

    "Ideally speaking, it should be constructed at the level of the BMC. But \ndetailed data for such quantification at the BMC level is hard to come by, but the KSBB may \ndevelop it. As a first step, we compute the area of those agricultural crops that allow \nintercropping with other crops. The share of the area under such bio-diverse crops in the total \ncropped area is computed. It shows that about 77per cent of the cropped area in the states is \nunder bio-diverse crops in 2016-17,although it has shown some slight reduction in 2016-17 \ncompared to 2007-08 (Figure 2).

Given the fact that \nexisting gene banks and other ex-situ conservation measures are not sufficient enough to \nconserve agrobiodiversity, it is recommended that custodian farmers should be the main focus of \nagrobiodiversity conservation as they are functioning as a farmer-cultivators as well as farmer-\nconserver. So the policy on agrobiodoversity management must include identification, support \nand promotion of custodian farmers.",
    "So the policy on agrobiodoversity management must include identification, support \nand promotion of custodian farmers. Examples of custodian farmers include, Chruvayal Raman \nor Ramettan-a Kurichiya tribe farmer by birth, is leading a battle to preserve age-old traditions of \ncultivation that were prevalent among the Adivasis of Wayanad. N. M. Shaji, who is conserving \na wide spectrum of tuber crops, including wild tubers, paddy, and vegetables using organic \ncultivation methods, is another notable custodian farmer: he had also won the national Plant \nGenome Saviour Award in 2015. 2.7.2Access Benefit Sharing \nThe Nagoya protocol on Biodiversityemphasizes the access to the genetic resources and its fair \nand equitable benefit sharing of genetic resources.

The transition to an ABS regime is a priority area identified by the State \nPlanning Board, in its working group report on biodiversity for the 13th Five Year Plan (Kerala \nState Planning Board, 2017). Chapter 9 of the working group report deals with ABS. It proposes \na statewide scheme for documenting commercially tradablebio resources and industries utilising \nthe resources.",
    "It proposes \na statewide scheme for documenting commercially tradablebio resources and industries utilising \nthe resources. The report calls for equipping panchayat-level Biodiversity Management \nCommittees (BMCs) with negotiating skills to maximise the returns from trade in bioresources \nunder the ABS regime. The BMC would be authorised to levy collection fee for accessing \nbiological resources for commercial purposes. The levy would be deposited in a local \nbiodiversity fund and utilised for conservation activities.

CTCRI developed biopesticides from cassava leaves which are popular in the state, namely \nNanma, Sreya and Menma. It is effective for preventing Pseudostem weevil attack and Rhizome \nweevil attack in banana cultivation. There is immense scope for promoting these biopesticides in \nthe state, especially since a lot of farmers are cultivating banana as compared to paddy. Organic farming network project is being carried out by the Centre. It is reported that \nstandardised organic farming practices for all major tuber crops are being promoted. Mobile app, \nnamely ‗Tuber Guru‘ has been developed for getting information related to the tropical tuber \ncrops for the public both in English and Malayalam languages. Algorithm for Variety \nIdentification Tool (VIT) app to identify varieties of tuber crops based on their morphological \nattributes like colour, shape, leaf, etc., has also been developed. On the front of the promotion of \nagro biodiversity, CTCRI plays a pivotal role in the conservation of tuber crops‘ diversity.

    "3.2.1 Conservation of Indigenous Animals \nVechur Cow  \nVechur Cattle Conservation Project is running under the KVASU for increasing the reproduction \nand conservation of indigenous cattle. Vechur cattle are indigenous, disease resistant and \nsuitable for Kerala's climate. The average height for Vechur cows is three feet only, and the cost \nof feeding and rearing is less compared to the hybrids. Milk production may not be as high as \nhybrids, but the quality of Vechur milk is very high. A large Vechur farm under KVASU \ncomprising 120 cows is functioning in Mannuthy by applying scientific reproductive methods. Other Vechur farms are functioning in Thiruvazhamkunnu, Thumburmuzhy and Pookode. There \nis a huge demand for Vechur cow from the farmers. KVASU is supplying cattle based on \npriority only, and it is unable to meet the increased demand from farmers. Semen of Vechur \nbulls has been collected and protected as chilled semen through scientific methods for supplying \nto the farmers. It is reported that the regular supply of chilled semen to the already sold cows, \ntheir progeny and other registered cows are continuing from the project. 28 \n \n \n \n \nVechur Cows \nSource: http://vechur.org/ \n \nThe cattle conservation project is also aiming at the conservation of Kasaragode dwarf, which is \nanother indigenous variety.

The institute aims at \nsustainable food production by providing technology backup for better production and safe \nproduction practices. It also aims at rendering basic knowledge and practical experience in the \nfield to the youngsters who are interested in agriculture through its academic programmes. The \nstation was upgraded as Regional Agricultural Research Station for Central Zone comprising of \nErnakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad and Malappuram districtsunder the National Agricultural \nResearch Programme (NARP) in 1981. The first high yielding hybrid derivative variety of rice \nof South-East Asia ―Annapoorna (Ptb-35)‖ was released for cultivation by this station in 1966. RARS is concentrating on the collection and conservation of rice diversity in the state, which is \nthe most important crop of Kerala. There were three major seasons in Kerala for paddy \ncultivation i.e., Virippu (April-May to September-October),Mundakan (July-August to February-\nMarch) and Puncha (January-February to April-May). More than thousands of rice varieties, \nwhich were in cultivation during different seasons, have been collected and conserved in a well \nmaintained deep-freeze laboratory. Traditional varieties of paddy were well suited for the \ndifferent agro-climatic conditions in the state.

The RARS is providing traditional varieties of rice to \nfarmers who are interested in their cultivation. Such varieties can be considered as parent seeds \nfor breeding purposes for getting new traits and advantages through the research. The RARS is \nmaintaining acres of paddy land for the cultivation of rice varieties to get their new seeds for the \npurpose of conservation. Based on different rice varieties, there are different time periods. Among the traditional varieties of rice, some of them have special characteristics also. The 13 \nrice varieties which have resistance to salinity (seven types of pokkali, four types grown in the \nsaline land of Pannanikole wet land, and two types of Kaippadu land) have been identified. Ten \ndrought-resistant varieties and 12 flood-resistant varieties have also been identified. Seven types \nof scented rice varieties (like jeerakasala, gandhakasala,neycheeraetc. ), seventeen varieties with \nmedicinal value (navara, nallachennellu, rakthasali etc. ), and three types of good cooking \nquality have been characterised as special traditional varieties. The traditional rice varieties have been donors for various traits in the rice breeding programmes \nworldwide. The rice improvement efforts had been made in the station in earlier times before the \ngreen revolution and resulted in the popularisation of various rice varieties.",
    "Pattambi rice \nvarieties are internationally acclaimed for their performance and accepted as international donors \nfor biotic and a-biotic stress breeding (75 years of research, RARS, Pattambi-2002). A lot of new \nvarieties have been developed considering the high yielding possibilities and different agro-\nclimatic situations in Kerala. The varieties with disease-resistant, pest resistant, survival capacity \nof climate conditions, etc., have been developed by the station. It is reported that the yield of \n \n 32 \n \n \n \ntraditional varieties will be lower, but the traits will be higher. The farmers are interested in \ncultivating high yielding varieties because of the expectation of profitability of cultivation.

Thanal so far has trained more than 200 master trainers for organic farming training and runs \nthree facilities in the state to train farmers and youth on organic farming. The Save our Rice Campaign, which is a national movement, was organised by Thanal in Kerala \nto revive the paddy diversity of the farming system. It is reported that thousands of farmers in \nfive states are adopting ecological farming practices, conserving and cultivating traditional \nvarieties of high-quality seeds, and ensuring the supply of organic rice to consumers across these \nstates. Conservation of traditional paddy varieties in Rice Diversity Block has been established \nas part of Save our Rice Campaign.

New varieties have been developed through crop improvement for high yield, disease \nresistance, etc. 3. Institutions are facing challenges and limitations in the extension services. Only \npassionate farmers or interested agencies are utilising the services of these institutions. Lack of proper knowledge about these institutions and the importance of agricultural \npractices among the public are serious concerns. 4. In view of the extension possibilities, NGOs are seen to be performing better as \ncompared to the government institutions, by collaborating with local governments and \n \n 40 \n \n \n \nintervention at grassroots level through community mobilisation.

    "4. The cases of 4 modelGrama Panchayats \nIn this section, we analyse the role of four local self-governments from across Kerala who can \njustifiably be termed as model grama panchayats as far as the appreciation and maintenance of \nagrobiodiversity and indeed biodiversity, in general, is concerned. Our selection of these \npanchayats hasbeen guided by the fact that they have either been selected as the best \nBMCseither by the National Biodiversity Authority or the Kerala State Biodiversity Board \n(Table 11)12. Besides, one of the four has been hailed as a model panchayat for organic vegetable \ncultivation and has a long history of being the only panchayat in the whole state of Kerala that is \nself-sufficient in vegetable cultivation. The purpose of conducting these case studies is to \nunderstand and place on the table those practical points that other panchayats can emulate. It is \nalso seen that all the four panchayats have adopted a different strategy towards agrobiodiversity \nthus bringing home the point that there is no one model that fits all. Each of the panchayats have \nimprovised strategies that are specific to the needs of respective panchayats. These range from \nrejuvenation and maintenance of water bodies to vegetable cultivation to maintenance of forest \ncover. We also see that success in the maintenance of agrobiodiversity is linked to the presence \nof two important factors.",
    "We also see that success in the maintenance of agrobiodiversity is linked to the presence \nof two important factors. These are: (i) a strategy for agrobiodiversity is basically a function of \nwhether it is inexorably linked to a livelihood strategy. If it is, then there can be widespread \nacceptance of management of agrobiodiversity as it can bring in immediate tangible benefits to \nthe inhabitants of those villages. Otherwise, the notion of agrobiodiversity can remain as a \ntheoretical concept, the benefits of which are understood only by a few people who are \nenvironmentally oriented. Such individuals are, unfortunately, short in supply; and (ii) successful \nimplementation of the agrobiodiversity strategy requires the presence of a charismatic mentor \nwhose leadership is widely accepted and who is extremely resourceful. It is very often the \npresence of such individuals who make a big difference to the successful implementation of \nagrobiodiversity policies and not other institutional mechanisms such as the BMCs.This, of \ncourse, has the danger of the whole strategy fizzling out with the eclipse of this mentor from the \nhorizon.

Beginning from \n1994 Kanjikuzhisurpassed its geographical deficit of being sand-like soil-deprived region which \nwas not suitable for vegetable cultivation with the collective effort of panchayat and \ngovernment. The panchayat decided to come up with different policies and programmes that \nwould encourage farmers to initiate organic farming with utmost dedication. In fact, twenty \nyears down the line it is the only panchayat in the state that is self-sufficient in vegetable \ncultivation. The panchayat has a diverse cropping pattern (see Table 12). BMC \nBMC was formed in 2008, consisting of 8 members as per the guidelines. In 2011 BMC \nprepared People‘s Biodiversity Register (PBR).

Each team \nconsisted of nearly 20 people who are actively involved in the survey. They have collected \ninformation from the ward level and then consolidated it as per the guidance from the KSSB \ncoordinators. The coordinators of KSBB have visited the Panchayat and have given orientation \ntraining to the survey team. The preparation of PBR was completed within three months. Yearly \nupdation of the PBR seems to be missing in this panchayat. Therefore, verification of the bio-\ndiversity and species mentioned in the PBR was not possible. Moreover, the BMC was not \nactive after this exercise. In 2015, BMC was reconstituted by the Panchayat but no Action Plan \nhas been formulated since then.

Illathukaavuis popular with endemic species of wild plants like calophyllumcalaba \nlocally known as cherupunna).But in the field visit, bio fencing was not seen anywhere in the \nkaavu and it was demolished and the premises of kaavu was being utilised as a playground. Lack \nof proper fencing and protection literally turned the kaavu into a littering ground. Only the fallen \ntrees are not been taken away mainly because that is forbidden as per the local belief. A temple \nis still functioning in the middle of the kaavu. Such temples may be part of this entire kaavu \necology, but the question is how to protect the flora and fauna with the existence of a temple and \nactivity around it. The panchayat is yet evolving a reasonable strategy to conserve this sacred \nplace because, it seems, the existing mechanism will adversely affect the health and existence \nofthekaavu in the long run. The primary function of the BMC is to maintain a document on local biological resources and \nassociated traditional knowledge. Conservation, sustainable use, and documentation of \nbiodiversity and equitable sharing of benefits, arising from its use, are also coming under the \nmandate of BMC.",
    "Generally, most of the Biodiversity Management Committees (BMC) in all \nlocal self-government institutions is not functional after the preparation of PBR and have failed \nto exercise their power and responsibility mainly due to the lack of awareness. Kanjikuzhi \npanchayat is also an example of this. 43 \n \n \n \nThe panchayat has been very successful in maintaining agrobiodiversity in the panchayat by \nlinking it to livelihood strategy and this appears to be working well as the people are deriving a \ncontinuous source of income.

Financial support \n \n 45 \n \n \n \nfrom KSBB has been received by the panchayat for the preparation of PBR, creation of Star \nForest and Carbon Neutral Project. BMC has prepared a project as part of its Action Plan for the construction of organic fertiliser \nunit. This unit will collect all type of organic waste from the panchayat area for the processing of \nfertiliser. It is expected to avoid chemical fertilisers from the agricultural sector by supplying \nthis organic fertiliser for the cultivation of Eraviperoor Rice and other agricultural crops. Organic farming has been promoting in the agricultural sector, especially for vegetables, but \nfarmers are using chemical fertilisers in the paddy cultivation (Eraviperoor rice) extensively. There was no separate scheme prepared for the protection of Kaavu,-wetland ecosystems. Annual review of PBR has not been conducted so far. As far as protection of natural resources is \nconcerned, BMC is planning to implement ‗Tree Pledging instead of Cutting‘ Project, Varattar \nProtection Scheme, Implementation of user fee for the houses having tiled courtyard etc. As per the PBR data, nearly 140 varieties of agricultural crops have been cultivated including \nfood crops, cash crops, spices, vegetables and tubers. Out of this 35 varieties of vegetables and \n40 varieties of tubers had been identified.",

Only 24 \nvarieties of livestock and pets are being reared in the Panchayat. Two rivers (Varattar and \nManimala), one canal and 4 thodu (water streams) and 2 ponds (under private custody) have \nbeen identified as water bodies within the panchayat area. BMC reported that PBR has to be \nupdated and digitalised by adding up of new data based on the new survey. It is expected to be \nachieved within a short period of time. From the field level observation,Eraviperoor panchayat is ensuring the involvement of BMC in \nthe process of implementation of several conventional projects of grama panchayats also like \nconstruction of rain pits, agricultural promotion, providing drinking water etc., given these \nprojects are related to environment assets. Rejuvenation of Varattar river, efforts for removing \nencroachments, etc., were the outstanding measures in front of the environment protection. A \nnotable point is that conducting Eco-Grama Sabha in all wards was a unique attempt of \nEraviperoor grama panchayat and it generated environmental awareness among the people.

    "It \nalso encouraged disclosing more suggestions and ensuring the participation of people in \nenvironment conservation. 4.2.1 Varattar-Aadi Pamba rejuvenation \nThe most important activity of BMC was the rejuvenation of a river - -Varattar and Aadi Pamba. Varattaar is a tributary of Aadi Pamba and it reaches Manimala River. Varattar was the main \nsource of water for hundreds of households in its earlier period. This river had a natural \nimportance that acted as a natural flood control mechanism between Pamba and Manimala \nrivers, carrying the excess water from both ways. Due to the land encroachment and sand \nmining, it became a drought river forthelast 35 years, and some people were using the banks of \nthis area for cultivation purpose. The grama panchayat has taken initiatives to sketch out the \nboundaries of the river using land records. It is reported that there were many hurdles that had \ntobefaced in the initial time. BMC prepared an action plan under MGNREGS to rejuvenate the \nriver, and the activities started in 2013-14. The rejuvenation activities were implemented with \nthe people‘s participation. All obstructions towards the natural pathway of the river were \nremoved by cleaning and chopping away of branches of trees by MGNREGS workers and local \npeople, and removal culverts across the river. 46 \n \n \n \n \nCreation of river pathway \n(Photo is taken from Panchayat records-PPT slides) \n \n13.5 acres of riverbank has been regained with the magnificent efforts of the panchayat.",
    "The \nDPR is prepared and submitted to the Haritha KeralamMission. The first stage has been \ncompleted within 3 months without any government aid, but Rs.80 crore has been announced for \nthe rejuvenation by the state government in the second stage. Varattar is flowing through the nearest local governments of Eraviperoor, i.e. Koippram and \nKuttoor panchayats and Chengannoor municipality. Eraviperoor panchayat has triggered actions \natthe beginning for the rejuvenation of Varattaar. It generated a compulsion to participate in \nother nearest local governments which are sharing the banks of Varattar. The rejuvenation of the \nriver programme has become the major environmental conservation programme of nearest \npanchayats and Chengannoor municipality along with Eraviperoor panchayat with the support of \ndistrict administration and Haritha Keralam Mission. Varatte...Aaru.....(Let river come) Riverwalk campaign was organised by the local governments \nand hundreds of people gathered on the banks of Varattar river including political leaders, \nministers and MLAs.

The biodiversity richness of Kole wetland has been documented \nsystematically which includes 144 floral species, 21 species of mammals, 14 species of \nreptiles, 06 species of amphibians, and 244 species of birds. This was a remarkable effort \nof the panchayat for the conservation of Kole wetland area. e) Exhibition cum symposium \nAn exhibition cum symposium had been conducted to generate environmental awareness \namong the public. Many experts, teachers, stakeholders, NGOs,etc., had participated in \nthe symposium.",
    "Many experts, teachers, stakeholders, NGOs,etc., had participated in \nthe symposium. f) Promotion of paddy cultivation /endemic species of tubers  \nPanchayat officials reported that a project for promoting paddy cultivation in 5 acres of \nland had been implemented with the support of Youth Clubs. It is expected to create a \npassion for paddy cultivation among the youths. All other supports, i.e., seeds, fertilisers, \nsubsidies, etc., have been supplied to the farmers. Furthermore, endemic species of tubers \nhave been identified, and its seeds have also been supplied to the individuals for the \npromotion of endemic tuber production. g) Nakshathravanam \nNakshathravanam (Star Forest) project aims at planting trees based on the birth star of \nthe people. Each birth star has its own tree as envisioned in the concept of Hindu religion \nand belief. State Biodiversity Board sanctioned Rs. 4.5 lakhs for the creation of \nNakshathravanam. The panchayat is planning to create Nakshathravanamnear to the \npublic crematorium. PBR \nMarancherry faced delay in preparation of PBR because of BMC was not active in the initial \nperiod. The PBR was prepared in 2018 as per the instructions of State Biodiversity Board. The \nState Bio-Diversity Board has provided training, guidance and support for the preparation of \nPBR. The grama panchayat allocated one lakh rupees for preparing PBR. The survey team \ncomprising of 2 people for each ward wasformulated.",
    "The grama panchayat allocated one lakh rupees for preparing PBR. The survey team \ncomprising of 2 people for each ward wasformulated. The support and participation of teachers, \nstudents and ward members was used by the survey team. It is reported that all possible \nbiological resources have been documented properly because Marancherry prepared PBR very \n \n 55 \n \n \n \nrecently. The process of preparation of PBR has been completed within one-year. A project is \nprepared now for the digitalisation of PBR. As per the PBR, 23 varieties of food grains particularly paddy have been identified. Along with \nthis, 36 varieties of vegetables, 13 tubers and 12 varieties of cash crops have also been \nidentified. Forty varieties of medicinal plants, 28 varieties of wild medicinal plants, 19 items of \nlivestock and pets and 25 wild fish wealth items have also been recorded in the PBR. There are \nexisting 80 watersheds, including streams/thodu and ponds. As far as the conservation of RET species is concerned, panchayat is planting and protecting \nmangroves. Panchayat is implementing several schemes for protecting ecosystem like wetlands, \nmangroves and kaavu. Biodiversity Clubs are functioning well in the schools. A local survey has \nbeen conducted by NGOs with the monitoring of panchayat for assessing carbon emission to \naddress the issues of climate change.",
    "A local survey has \nbeen conducted by NGOs with the monitoring of panchayat for assessing carbon emission to \naddress the issues of climate change. Marancherry grama panchayat is a notable village in the case of natural resources like \nmangroves, canals, ponds, lake, rivers, Kole wetlands, kaavus etc. The panchayat is \nimplementing several schemes considering its ecological importance. Most of the schemes are \nimplemented through MGNREGS. Activities of MGNREGS based on the environment assets \ngenerally come under the purview of BMC. The convenor of BMC is very active in monitoring \nall the activities which have natural importance. Therefore, it can be projected as the activities of \nBMC for the protection of the environment. On the basis of such tasks of BMC which includes \nconservation of traditional water bodies, creation of new ponds and streams, biodiversity \ndocumentation of Kole wetland, planting bamboos and mangroves in the canal and lakeside, eco-\nfriendly waste management system, symposiums for environmental awareness building etc., \nMarancherry has been awarded by the State Biodiversity Board as the best BMC in 2019. 4.5 Insights from the four case studies \nTable 13:  Summary of major achievements of the grama panchayats \nSl.No \nGrama panchayat \nMajor Achievements \n1.

Eraviperoor and Kanjikkuzhi prepared \nPBR in 2011, Meenangadi in 2012 and Marancherry prepared in 2018.  The way of preparation of PBR was more or less similar in all selected panchayats in \nreliance on the guidance of the State Biodiversity Board.  The updation and digitalisation of PBR is thenext task of all BMCs. The initial works \nalready started.  All grama panchayats are keeping minutes of the meeting of BMC except Kanjikuzhi.  BMCs in all selected panchayats have been reconstituted once.  Separate office room for BMC has been seen in Meenangadigramapanchayat only.  Plastic shredding units are functioning in all selected panchayats except Kanjikuzhi for \nensuring eco-friendly waste management system. In Kanjikuzhi, Harithakeralam Mission \ncollects plastic waste for recycling purpose.",
    "In Kanjikuzhi, Harithakeralam Mission \ncollects plastic waste for recycling purpose.  Normally there is no separate fund for the Action Plans of BMC except special funds \nfrom State Biodiversity Board for model BMCs. Such paucity of funds of BMC was \novercomeby the panchayats by integrating selected conventional projects of panchayats \nwhich are directly or indirectly related to environment assets into the Action Plan of \nBMC.  Effective use of MGNREGS is a pivotal factor for the best performance in the selected \nfour grama panchayats. Majority of the heads under MGNREGS like afforestation, water \nconservation, drought proofing, and renovation of water bodies etc., which are direct \nbenefits to the environment conservation. Therefore, MGNREGS can be considered as a \nscheme which contributes to the environment protection at the local level along with the \nemployment generation. These grama panchayats ensure the monitoring of BMCs in the \nimplementation of such projects. In other words, the majority of the activities of BMCs in \naccordance with the Action Plan have been implemented through MGNREGS.  Effective integration of various schemes, i.e., schemes of transferred institutions like \nKrishibhavan, departmental schemes, centrally sponsored schemes (MGNREGS), etc., \nhave been brought out in line with the plan formulation in selected panchayats.",
    "For \ninstance, an attempt has been made by these panchayats to enhance the paddy cultivation \nwas by using labour force of MGNREGS and seeds, fertilisers and other supports from \nKrishibhavan.  Measures of Meenangadito become India‘s first carbon-neutral panchayat and creation of \nartificial forest, efforts of Eraviperoor in the rejuvenation of Varattar river, conducting \nEco-Gramasabha and promoting Eraviperoor Rice, attempts of Marancherry in the \nconservation Kole wetland have been observed as exemplary steps in the context of \nbiodiversity conservation.  Kanjikuzhi grama panchayat is renowned for the vegetable cultivation and it has been \nobserved as a life culture of the people of Kanjikuzhi. Providing seeds and all other \nsupports to promote vegetable cultivation in all households, identifying barren land to \ncultivate vegetables by using MGNREGS labourers under the monitoring of panchayat, \nmaintaining vegetable shops to promote marketing, are the major activities of Kanjikuzhi \ngrama panchayat in this context. The attempt of Kanjhikuzhi grama panchayat to promote \nvegetable cultivation can be considered as a unique in the context of agrobiodiversity \npromotion.  Role of NGOs, stakeholders, activists, etc., is very crucial and inevitable for local \ndevelopment, particularly in environment conservation. Active involvement of such \ngroups was significant in selected grama panchayats, and it was the back born for the best \nperformance of these panchayats.",
    "The proposed research should focus on the type \nand size of this financial incentive scheme. In this context, although the government has constituted a 13th working group on environment, \nbiodiversity and climate change with BMC as members, their role has remained merely  \nadvisory and so far  no funds have been allocated to them as well. Role of Government Research Institutes in developing knowledge for mainstreaming \nagrobiodiversity: There are a number of public research institutes in the state focusing on \nagrobiodiversity. However, they have been functioning in a vacuum, often doing research \nwithout any coordination with the Biodiversity Board. This coordination could be achieved by \nlinking these institutes to the Kerala State Biodiversity Board so that an annual research plan be \nmade and a consortium be formed to develop the requisite knowledge. Strengthening the role of the Kerala State Biodiversity Board specifically in the area of \nagrobiodiversity: The board has to be strengthened both financially and in terms of human \nresource so that it can play its coordinating role much more effectively than now. The precise \nways in which the board may be strengthened will form the focus of this research. The working \nrelations of KSBB with all the institutions in the state working on agriculture is to be \nstrengthened. The role of KSBB at the district level requires special attention.",
    "The role of KSBB at the district level requires special attention. Assessing the fiscal support for agrobiodiversity management: Of the total budget allocation \nfor agriculture only a miniscule amount is allocated fir agrobiodiversity management. A higher \nallocation is to be made after making a detailed study of the budgetary requirements. Role of NGOs/CSOS in the diffusion of knowledge on agrobiodiversity: Since NGOs work \nwith local communities, they can build effective bridges between GRIs and local self-\ngovernments. The research here should focus on these specific ways in which this bridge-\nbuilding can be effected. Documenting success stories from Panchayats and BMCs: There are a limited number of \npanchayats that have been very successful. However, each of these has adopted a different \n \n 58 \n \n \n \nstrategy for maintaining agrobiodiversity. Some have taken to vegetable cultivation and linked it \nwith livelihoods; others have been focusing on the planting of different species of trees while \nstill others have been improving waterbodies and thereby the supply of water for irrigation. These stories need to be written up so that other panchayats which are laggards can learn from \nthe successful ones. Role of IPRs in promoting agrobiodiversity: A number of IPRs such as GI and Plant Varieties \nhave been issued recently. It can have two possible effects.",
    "It can have two possible effects. For instance, by having different \nvarieties of rice (for instance, having a GI for Navara rice may enthuse farmers to have it \ncultivated) will certainly contribute to the maintenance of agrobiodiversity. On the contrary, \nhaving a GI tag can also result in monocropping  \nImpact of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) on agrobiodiversity:There are about 9 FTAsthat \nare in force, and threemore are in various stages of negotiation. One of the impacts of these freer \nimports of agricultural goodscan have a deleterious effect on agricultural crops and thereby on \nagrobiodiversity. However, it is also possible that such freer imports can also affect certain \nmonocrops more adversely that in its place a more diverse vegetation can spring up. The area \nunder most of the monocrops has shown a steady decline. The extent to which the BD Act in the state meet the National Biodiversity Action Plan and \nthe National Biodiversity Targets (NBTs); This is an area which requires constant monitoring \nand mid-course correction. The KSBB may be equipped to carry out this annual monitoring. It is \na kind of action research that we are suggesting. Identification of major physical threats to agrobiodiversity: It is generally recognised that \ninvasive species is one of the major threats. A regulatory mechanism for controlling the \nintroduction of invasive species as exotic flora and fauna needs to be deigned.",
    "A regulatory mechanism for controlling the \nintroduction of invasive species as exotic flora and fauna needs to be deigned. Impact of climate change on agrobiodiversity: Extreme weather event such as severe floods \nand drought are now occurring, unfortunately rather regularly leading to a deleterious effect on \nagrobiodiversity. A study on possible ways ameliorating the negative effects of these extreme \nweather events is essential. 6. Conclusions \nIt looks that there is an awareness of the importance of protecting agrobiodiversity at the state \nlevel and also among a number of non-governmental and civil society stakeholders. However \nnone of the LSGs that we studied had any intimate knowledge of NBAP and NBTs. The state \nhas also put in place a number of legal and policy instruments aimed at protecting biodiversity in \ngeneral (which include agrobiodiversity too). There is also an organisational mechanism (Kerala \nState Biodiversity Board) to steer the agenda in this regard. The research institutes are by and \nlarge aware of the impact of their actions on biodiversity. A significant share of local \ngovernments has completed the formal requirement of preparing PBR as advocated by the \nKSBB. A few of them consider the conservation of local biodiversity as an important agenda and \ntake different steps in this direction. The other important aspect in Kerala is that a more-diverse cropping system seems to be \neconomically attractive compared to a less-diverse or mono-cropping system.",
    "The other important aspect in Kerala is that a more-diverse cropping system seems to be \neconomically attractive compared to a less-diverse or mono-cropping system. This could be due \nto agro-climatic and economic conditions. The latter include the need for more labour for \nmonocropping systems, which makes it less attractive in Kerala where the cost of labour is \nhigher, and where there are possibilities of nurturing profitable multi-crop systems. This gives \ncertain economic incentives to the farmers and land-owners to sustain a relatively diverse \nfarming system, which in turn helps the conservation of agrobiodiversity. 59 \n \n \n \nHowever, there are a number of limitations or challenges too. These include: \nThough there are legal and policy instruments, there is not enough clarity on the mobilization of \nresources and mechanisms for their enforcement. Hence, some of these legal/policy provisions \nremain as wish statements. One can interpret this as an outcome of a situation where there is an \nawareness on the need to protect agrobiodiversity at the state level, but that is not translating into \nworkable strategies for its protection due to other constraints of the state government. To some extent, this is true with regard to the Kerala State Biodiversity Board too. On paper, it \nhas a number of responsibilities and if these are undertaken, can go a long way in protecting the \nbiodiversity. However, it does not have adequate financial resources and authority for this \npurpose.",
    "However, it does not have adequate financial resources and authority for this \npurpose. Kerala is yet to put in place a system of auditing all policies which can have potential negative \nimpacts on agrobiodiversity. These include the policies and programmes for the promotion of \nagriculture and plantation crops in general. However growth in area of most of the plantation \ncrops in the state has been limited by adverse market conditions. Though PBR is the main instrument and a major share of local governments has prepared it, it is \nseen as more of a task to be completed at a point of time. It is not seen as a basis for building up \nagro-biodiversity by most local governments. This may be seen as an outcome of a top-down \napproach towards conservation where the awareness at the state level has not translated to the \nlevel of local governments and communities. It can be seen that the use of PBR and other actions for the purpose of protecting agro-\nbiodiversity are notable in the case of certain local governments. The role of one or a few people \nis crucial in this regard. This shows that the success of the local-level collective action requires \nthe presence of a few well-informed and active individuals. This is not unusual considering the \nstatus of collective action which is taken to address the market failure in other domains too in \ncountries such as ours.",

This \nis an area where future research is required. 2.6Extent of Agrobiodiversity in Kerala \nIt is essential that we have a summary measure to quantify the extent of agro biodiversity and its \nchanges over time. Ideally speaking, it should be constructed at the level of the BMC. But \ndetailed data for such quantification at the BMC level is hard to come by, but the KSBB may \ndevelop it. As a first step, we compute the area of those agricultural crops that allow \nintercropping with other crops. The share of the area under such bio-diverse crops in the total \ncropped area is computed. It shows that about 77per cent of the cropped area in the states is \nunder bio-diverse crops in 2016-17,although it has shown some slight reduction in 2016-17 \ncompared to 2007-08 (Figure 2). This is essentially due to the fact that – Natural Rubber- one of \nthe primary commodities and the main mono-crops in the state has increased its share of cropped \narea (Figure 3), although all other monocrops have reduced their area. However, Natural Rubber \ncontinues to occupy an important position in the cropping pattern of the state (Figure 4). Figure 2: Trends in Agrobiodiversity Index, 2007-08 and 2016-17 \nSource: Based on data contained in Economic Review, Kerala State Planning Board (various \nissues)  \n79.3\n76.89\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n2007-08\n2016-17\n \n 23 \n \n \n \nFigure 3: Changes in area under monocrops during 2007-08 and 2016-17 \nSource: Based on data contained in Economic Review, Kerala State Planning Board (various \nissues)  \nFigure 4: Cropping pattern of the state (as on March 31, 2018)  \nSource: Based on data contained in Economic Review, Kerala State Planning Board (various \nissues)  \nHowever considerable gaps exist in our knowledge of genetic diversity of crops. The annual data \non agricultural area and output brought by the State‘s Department of agriculture does not reveal \nagrobioversity. Hence we recommend that the agricultural statistics may include varietal \ndiversity of at least the major agricultural crops to enable better conservation of \nAgrobiodiversity. 2.7 Some critical issues having a bearing on management of agrobiodiversity \nHere we discuss two specific issues that have a bearing on management of agrobiodiversity in \nKerala. These are the role of custodian farmers and Access Benefit Sharing. These are discussed \nin some detail below:  \n \n7.08\n-72.10\n-19.87\n-19.62\n-39.99\n-4.15\n-80.00\n-70.00\n-60.00\n-50.00\n-40.00\n-30.00\n-20.00\n-10.00\n0.00\n10.00\n20.00\nRubber\nGinger(Dry)\nTurmeric\nTea\nPineapple\nTotal \nmonocrops \nCoconut**\n37%\nRubber#\n27%\nRice\n9%\nAreca Nut\n5%\nPepper\n4%\nCoffee***\n4%\nTapioc\n3%\nBanana\n3%\nOther Platains\n3%\nCashew nut\n2%\nCardamom*\n2%\nTea $\n1%\nGinger\n0%\nTurmeric\n0%\nPulses \nincluding Tur\n0%\n \n 24 \n \n \n \n2.7.1 Role of custodian farmers \nBiodiversity international, a CGIAR research Centre defines custodian farmers as ―Custodian \nfarmers are defined as ―those farmers (men and women) who actively maintain, adapt and \ndisseminate agricultural biodiversity and related knowledge, over time and space, at farm and \ncommunity levels and are recognized by community members for it‖. Given the fact that \nexisting gene banks and other ex-situ conservation measures are not sufficient enough to \nconserve agrobiodiversity, it is recommended that custodian farmers should be the main focus of \nagrobiodiversity conservation as they are functioning as a farmer-cultivators as well as farmer-\nconserver. So the policy on agrobiodoversity management must include identification, support \nand promotion of custodian farmers. Examples of custodian farmers include, Chruvayal Raman \nor Ramettan-a Kurichiya tribe farmer by birth, is leading a battle to preserve age-old traditions of \ncultivation that were prevalent among the Adivasis of Wayanad. N. M. Shaji, who is conserving \na wide spectrum of tuber crops, including wild tubers, paddy, and vegetables using organic \ncultivation methods, is another notable custodian farmer: he had also won the national Plant \nGenome Saviour Award in 2015. 2.7.2Access Benefit Sharing \nThe Nagoya protocol on Biodiversityemphasizes the access to the genetic resources and its fair \nand equitable benefit sharing of genetic resources. This is known as Access Benefit Sharing \n(ABS). As per Section 7 of Biodiversity Act 2002 and Section 16 of Kerala Biological Diversity \nRule, 2008, any Indian citizen or body corporate or association or registered organization should \nseek approval of the KSBB for access to collection of biological resources in Kerala for \ncommercial utilization. The transition to an ABS regime is a priority area identified by the State \nPlanning Board, in its working group report on biodiversity for the 13th Five Year Plan (Kerala \nState Planning Board, 2017). Chapter 9 of the working group report deals with ABS. It proposes \na statewide scheme for documenting commercially tradablebio resources and industries utilising \nthe resources. The report calls for equipping panchayat-level Biodiversity Management \nCommittees (BMCs) with negotiating skills to maximise the returns from trade in bioresources \nunder the ABS regime. The BMC would be authorised to levy collection fee for accessing \nbiological resources for commercial purposes. The levy would be deposited in a local \nbiodiversity fund and utilised for conservation activities. According to press reports11, the \nKSBB had identified 2,694 industrial units including Ayurvedic drug companies, tea and coffee \nmanufacturers, agro-based units, food and fruit processing centres, leather, cashew, textiles, \npaper, rubber, coir, spices, wood and bamboo-based industries and exporters of these products \nthat were liable to pay a part of their sales revenue for access to bioresources and associated \ntraditional knowlededge into a fund to be denoted as Local Biodiversity Fund. We could not find \nout whether fund has actually been created and whether the rules for operationalising the fund \nhave been created. This is one of the policy instruments for agrobiodiversity management that \nneeds immediate attention. 3.Public ResearchInstitutions(PRIs) that support knowledge creation \nfor agrobiodiversity \n \nKerala has a wide network of public research institutes which have been engaged in the \ngeneration of formalised knowledge for ensuring agrobiodiversity. These are owned by the \ncentral and state governments. Further, there are a limited number of NGOs which are diffusing \nknowledge on agrobiodiversity. Of these, 5 PRIs (national and state level) and 2 NGOs which \nare actively engaged in the promotion of agrobiodiversity have been selected. The CDSteam also \n                                                                 \n11See Nandakumar T (2017)  \n \n 25 \n \n \n \nselected 2 more PRIs that are active in promotion of biodiversity in general as well. The \nactivities and interventions of these institutions in these areas have also been assessed. Table 6: PRIs and NGOs selected for in-depth examination \nSl.

Kerala Forest Research Institute(KFRI),Peechi, Thrissur \nBiodiversity \n \n3.1Central Tuber Crops Research Institute (CTCRI) \nCTCRI is a national-level institute coming under Indian Council of Agricultural Research \n(ICAR) to undertake basic, strategic and applied research for generating technologies to \nenhance productivity and utilization potential of tuber crops other than potato. The key areas \nare genetic resource management, crop improvement, sustainable production and utilization of \ntropical tuber crops. It acts as a national repository of scientific information on tuber crops and \ntransferring tuber crops technology through consultancy, outreach programmes and linkage \nwith developmental agencies. The activities of CTCRI have been executed through five \ndivisions i.e., Crop Improvement, Crop Production, Crop Protection, Crop Utilisation and \nExtension and Social Sciences. The collection of germplasm of different tuber crops from \ndifferent parts of the world and conserving it in field gene bank has been carrying out under \ncrop improvement division. The development of new varieties of tuber crops with higher yield \nand other attributes suitable for industrial applications as well as for food purpose is another \nimportant activity of this division. The development of new agro techniques for tropical tuber \ncrops in different agro-climatic regions is being monitored under crop production division. The \ndevelopment of strategies and products for managing pests and diseases, which are affecting \ntropical tuber crops is being monitored under crop protection division. Crop utilization division \nconcentrates its activities on value addition and post-harvest processing of tropical tuber crops. Transferring the technologies of CTCRI to its clienteles and introducing farmers‘ supporting \nschemes come under the extension and social sciences division. Generally, tuber crops are considered asthethird most important food crop. In present global \nscenario of climate change, tuber crops are gaining visibility as Future Smart Crops for climate \nresilience, low input cost and also for being rich in calorie, dietary fibers, minerals, vitamins \nand anti-oxidants (Research Highlights-2017-18, CTCRI). CTCRI is carrying out the \ndevelopment of tuber crops to ensure nutritional food and livelihood enhancement for the rural \npeople. The Centre organizes awareness training programmes, technical assistance, an \nincubator facility for the production of value-added products from tuber crops to farmers, \n \n 26 \n \n \n \nentrepreneurs, etc., The Centre also strives to popularize various kinds of tuber cultivation \namong the farmers. New varieties of tubers of high yield and disease-resistant have been \ndeveloped. The centre is conserving 15 species of tubers including cassava, sweet potato, yam, taro etc. The centre is also maintaining related species like 13 species of Greater yam, Lesser yam, \nPotato yam, 6 species of Taro, 8 species of Elephant yam, 4 species of Chinese potato, 8 species \nof Minor arrowroot, one species of minor wild tubers and one species of Asparagus. A total of \n5570 accessions comprising 1211 cassava, 1124 sweet potato, 1110 yams, 683 edible aroids, \n200 minor tuber crops and 1242 collections from Regional Centre (RC) were maintained and \nconserved in the field gene bank of CTCRI. It is reported that new collections were added to the \nexisting germplasm from various sources in sweet potato (20), yams (3), edible aroids (1) and \nminor tuber crops (15). The centredeveloped 67 new varieties of various kinds of tubers. It includes 19 Cassava \nvarieties, 21 Sweet Potato, 9 Greater yam, 5 White yam, 2 Lesser yam, 8 Edible aroids, 2 \nElephant foot yam, and one Chinese potato varieties. Cassava varieties i.e., SreeAthulya and \nSree Apoorva with higher yield and high extractable starch have been developed in CTCRI, \nTrivandrum has been registered in ICAR-NBPGR. Sweet potato varieties, i.e., BhuSona,Bhu \nKrishna, Bhu Swami have been developed in RC, ICAR-CTCRI Bhubaneswar has also been \nregistered in ICAR-NBPGR. CTCRI developed biopesticides from cassava leaves which are popular in the state, namely \nNanma, Sreya and Menma. It is effective for preventing Pseudostem weevil attack and Rhizome \nweevil attack in banana cultivation. There is immense scope for promoting these biopesticides in \nthe state, especially since a lot of farmers are cultivating banana as compared to paddy. Organic farming network project is being carried out by the Centre. It is reported that \nstandardised organic farming practices for all major tuber crops are being promoted. Mobile app, \nnamely ‗Tuber Guru‘ has been developed for getting information related to the tropical tuber \ncrops for the public both in English and Malayalam languages. Algorithm for Variety \nIdentification Tool (VIT) app to identify varieties of tuber crops based on their morphological \nattributes like colour, shape, leaf, etc., has also been developed. On the front of the promotion of \nagro biodiversity, CTCRI plays a pivotal role in the conservation of tuber crops‘ diversity. Previously, the KSBB had proposed a tuber germplasm conservation programme in Onattukara \npanchayat in Alappuzha district. However we could not find any update on this programme. 3.2 Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (KVASU) \nKerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (KVASU) was established in 2010 by the \nGovernment of Kerala to provide education, research and extension services in the field of \nVeterinary and Animal Sciences. The university occupies 100 acres of land at Pookode in \nWayanad district, which was allotted from the land belonging to the Pookode Dairy Tribal \nWelfare Project of Government of Kerala. The University comprises of three major areas: \nVeterinary and animal sciences, Dairy Science and Poultry Science. The 8 constituent colleges \nfunctioning under the university are College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences located at \nMannuthy and Pookodu,  College of Dairy Science and Technology located at  Mannuthy, \nPookode, Chettachal, Kolahalamedu, College of Avian Sciences and Management \nThiruvazhamkunnu, College of Food Technology, Thumburmuzhy, etc. The University has a \nwide network of instructional and research farms spread throughout the state. 27 \n \n \n \nVarious institutions under the university contribute to research and extension services in the \nfields of veterinary, dairy, poultry, etc. The Directorate of Entrepreneurship with headquarters at \nPookode, Wayanad focuses on capacity building of farmers, entrepreneurs and extend services \nthrough outreach programmes, developing model farms, supporting self-help groups in \nimproving production and productivity of livestock. The Directorate plays a vital role in \ncommercializing new ideas and raising productivity and employment in all sectors, especially \nbenefitting the farming community. The College of Dairy Science and Technology, is focussing \non the value addition of milk, establishment and commissioning of dairy plants throughout the \nstate, assuring safe and quality products for the public, designing kits and tests for quality \nanalysis of milk and milk products, maintaining active link between the field level farmers and \nscientific community, in-depth knowledge of farm animal practices etc. Centre for Advanced \nStudies in Poultry Science which is located at Mannuthy mainly focuses on academic and \nresearch on poultry science. It also conducts training programmes for farmers, conserving \npoultry germplasm, selection and breeding of egg production, etc. Wayanad district is rich in forests and wildlife. The human-wildlife conflict is a serious issue \nwhile considering agricultural practice in high ranges. Farmers are suffering from attacks of wild \nanimals as it damages crops and other consequences. Centre for Wildlife Studies of the \nuniversity is focusing on carrying out research in the areas of forest and biodiversity of the \nWestern Ghats region, human-wildlife conflicts etc. To conduct research on climate change \nadaptation and mitigation strategies in the field of Animal Agriculture, a Centre for Animal \nAdaptation to Environment and Climate Change Studies has been established. 3.2.1 Conservation of Indigenous Animals \nVechur Cow  \nVechur Cattle Conservation Project is running under the KVASU for increasing the reproduction \nand conservation of indigenous cattle. Vechur cattle are indigenous, disease resistant and \nsuitable for Kerala's climate. The average height for Vechur cows is three feet only, and the cost \nof feeding and rearing is less compared to the hybrids. Milk production may not be as high as \nhybrids, but the quality of Vechur milk is very high. A large Vechur farm under KVASU \ncomprising 120 cows is functioning in Mannuthy by applying scientific reproductive methods. Other Vechur farms are functioning in Thiruvazhamkunnu, Thumburmuzhy and Pookode. There \nis a huge demand for Vechur cow from the farmers. KVASU is supplying cattle based on \npriority only, and it is unable to meet the increased demand from farmers. Semen of Vechur \nbulls has been collected and protected as chilled semen through scientific methods for supplying \nto the farmers. It is reported that the regular supply of chilled semen to the already sold cows, \ntheir progeny and other registered cows are continuing from the project. 28 \n \n \n \n \nVechur Cows \nSource: http://vechur.org/ \n \nThe cattle conservation project is also aiming at the conservation of Kasaragode dwarf, which is \nanother indigenous variety. Conservation, scientific reproduction methods, and meeting \ndemandsoffarmers for Kasaragod dwarf cattle are being encouraged. The project also aims to \nmake people aware about the genetic diversity of indigenous cattle and to extend the low-cost \nlivestock rearing to the rural areas. In addition to the role of KVASU, the Vechur Conservation Trust has played an important role \nin conserving the indigenous animals. One of the main difficulties in diffusing indigenous cows \nlike the Vechur cow is the dairy policy of the state which lay emphasis on hybridsation of cows \nto improve milk yield. Pigs, Goats and other Animals \nKVASU is conserving indigenous Angamali pigs and maintaining farms. Centre for Pig \nProduction and Research under KVASU is functioning at Mannuthy. A pig breeding farm has \nalso been maintaining there. The major objective of the centre is to, conduct research on \ndifferent aspects of pig production, to operate as an instructional farm to students, to function as \na demonstration unit to farmers, to maintain purebred nuclear stock of animals for the supply of \nquality piglets to farmers. A new crossbred pig, namely ‗Mannuthy White‘ has been developed \nand released on 8thFebruary 2017. The centre is functioning with the objective to study the \nperformance of indigenous pigs and their crosses with Large White Yorkshire for the efficiency \nof feed conversion, production and reproduction. The Centre for Pig Production and Research \nMannuthy has been providing purebred and crossbred piglets to farmers for starting breeding \nunits all over Kerala and many parts of south India. The centre provides training, technical \nadvice and support to establish pig farms, etc. to the farmers. A Goat and Sheep Farm is functioning at Mannuthy. Supply of kids to farmers, technical and \nmanagerial advice to farmers about goat farming, breeding, etc. have been going on. Conservation of indigenous ‗Malabari Goat‘in its native tract, supply of superior breeding bucks \nto the field centres for breeding purpose are in progress under the Goat Improvement Scheme. KVASU has identified farmers for indigenous goat rearing and provides all support to them. A \nRabbit farm is also maintained, with a supply of rabbits, to provide technical advice to the needy \nfarmers. Poultry \n \n 29 \n \n \n \nA Poultry farm consisting of 34 varieties is being systematically maintained under the university. Varieties of indigenous and other egg fowls which include Gramasree, GramaLekshmi, Athulya, \nDesicross, Giriraja, Australorp, Rhode Island Red, New Hampshire,Thellichery, Aseel, \nKuttanadu duck, Kadaknath etc., are conserved in the farm. Other poultries including ducks, \nquails, ornamental poultries, etc., are alsoconservedin the farm. Schemes like Aiswarya have \nbeen introduced to propagate poultry to increase egg production in the state. Gothra Mission  \nBeing the largest institute for higher education in Wayanad and the only university of the \ndistrict, KVASU has taken a responsibility to participate in the efforts of the Government of \nKerala to work for the upliftment of tribal people. A new project, namely ‗Gothra Mission‘ has \nbeen introduced in this respect. Gothra Mission was formally inaugurated by the Hon. Governor \nof Kerala on 6th April, 2019. Today, tribes lead a marginalized life, far from the freedom they \nonce enjoyed in nature, forced to live in restricted spaces under extreme poverty and \nexploitation, having to depend on settlers for subsistence mostly as agricultural labourers. Poor \neducation and alcoholism are serious concerns among them. It is reported that KVASU having 100 acres of land, a large number of students and teaching \nfaculty with expertise in all areas associated with animal husbandry and allied areas, including \ncourses, training programmes and infrastructure suitable for training tribal youth for alternate \nlivelihood activities, are the advantages in tribal welfare work. Salient features of Gothra Mission \nPresently ninetribal students belonging to the Paniya community who are most vulnerable \namong tribes, are being trained for six months under the KVASU certificate course titled \n‗Multiskill Development Programme in Integrated Resource Management Centred on Livestock \nand Poultry‘. All of the students are dropouts from school; none has completed SSLC, working \nas daily wage labourers. Most of them come from landless families of Narangakandy Tribal \nColony, Kalpeta. KVASU provides a stipend of Rs. 500.00 per day for 5 days a week during the \nsix months course from the Scheduled Tribes Development Department (Integrated Tribal \nDevelopment Project, Kalpeta) for each student. Training in vegetable cultivation, poultry \nfarming, rabbit rearing, ornamental fish rearing, aquarium and pond making, poultry keeping, \nbeekeeping, mushroom cultivation, animal cage industrial fabrication, orchid and anthurium \ncultivation, dog keeping for breeding, ornamental bird breeding, etc. have been provided. Production units of each of these activities have been established in 2 acres of land at the \nuniversity campus. Display units of ‗I farm‘, is a novel method introduced by KVASU Centre for Wildlife Studies, \nestablished under the Gothra Mission. These units allow the integrated rearing of poultry, \nvegetables, fish, etc., in human-wildlife conflict areas. It is reported that these units are being \nmanaged by the tribal students and they are also trained in the manufacture of ―I farm‖ units. Students are being supported to continue school education under ‗Thulyatha‘ scheme. Now the \nstudents started earning money already from the sale of chicken eggs, vegetables, etc., at the \nuniversity campus. The tribal students are being organized into a co-operative that will function \nunder the continuous guidance of the university, and other tribal people will also be included. Produces, value-added products and services of the co-operative will be made available to the \npublic through the facilities of the university, including its sales counters. It is reported that \nlandless tribal members can undertake income-generating activities at the unused parts of the \nuniversity campus. Members who own land can undertake income-generating activities under \n \n 30 \n \n \n \nthe continuous guidance of the university. Ninety-five percent of the income from sales will be \ndivided among the members of the co-operative that participate in the activities, 5% of income \nwill be transferred to university for the sustainability of the project. A start-up company is being registered with the Technology Business Incubation Centre (TBIC) \nof the university by a fraternity of the alumni of various graduate and postgraduate courses of the \nuniversity under the leadership of alumni of the Master of Science (Wildlife Studies), course \nbeing run under the KVASU Centre for Wildlife Studies. The company will be responsible for \npublicizing and sales of the produce, value-added products and services of the co-operative, \nincluding the ―I farm‖ units, using online and other marketing methods at a national and \ninternational level, this will allow more demand and sustainability for the income-generating \nactivities of the co-operatives. Conducting research for further development, extension activities by making a link between \nscientists and farmers, providing training to the farmers, creating model farms, knowledge \ntransfer for scientific livestock rearing etc., have been carried  out by the various institutions in \nthe fields of veterinary, dairy, poultry under the university. The university strives to extend its \nresearch outcomes to the farmers by providing training, scientific methods for livestock rearing, \nconserving traditional varieties of animals and poultry, etc. The brand name of the university is \na crucial factor among the farmers and people, and it can be utilised to disseminate its activities. The Gothra Mission initiative of KVASU is a unique attempt to uplift the tribes by providing \nlivelihood opportunities through agricultural and livestock practices. This is contributing to the \npromotion of agrobiodiversity as well. 3.3 Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) \nKerala Agricultural University (KAU) was established in 1971 with the aim of excellence in \nagricultural education, research and extension for sustainable agricultural development and \nlivelihood security of the farming community. The headquarters of KAU is located at Mannuthy, \nThrissur. The University has seven colleges, sixRegional Agricultural Research Stations \n(RARS), other Research Stations and Research and Extension Units. In addition, an Academy on \nClimate Change Adaptation and an Institute of Agricultural Technology are also functioning in \nKAU.KAU is providing quality education in agriculture, horticulture, co-operation, forestry, \nagricultural engineering, home science and other allied disciplines through its various \ninstitutions. KAU is also rendering the support to increase the productivity of crops in the \nagricultural sector by means of research initiatives. The state has been divided into six agro-ecological zones by KAU to carry out research and \nextension of various crops based on location specificity. The zones are northern, high range, \ncentral, special zone for problem areas, Onattukara and southern zone.Two research stations are \nfunctioning in the Northern Zone for coconut and pepper. Regional Agricultural Research \nStation (RARS), Pilicode maintains a unique collection of coconut germplasm consisting of 35 \nexotic and 40 indigenous types and the research on hybridisation for getting high yield are being \ncarried out. Pepper Research Station, Panniyur has released five varieties of pepper, viz. Panniyur-1, Panniyur-2, Panniyur-3, Panniyur-4 and Panniyur-5 through their research and all \nare well received by the farmers. Two research stations are functioning to provide research \nsupport for agriculture in the High Range zone (Wayanad and Idukki districts and \nNelliyampathy area of Palakkad district). RARS, Ambalavayal(Wayanadu) concentrates on rice, \nspices and vegetables and serves as a major hub for the supply of seeds and planting materials of \nvarious crops. Cardamom Research Station, Pampadumpara is a substation of RARS \n \n 31 \n \n \n \nAmbalavayal and the station is maintaining a germplasm bank of 77 cultivated and 14 wild types \nof cardamom. In central zone, nine research stations are functioning for providing research and \nextension services for rice, banana, cashew, vegetables, medicinal plants, pineapple, passion \nfruit etc. Various crop varieties including banana, cashew has been released for cultivation \nthrough these centres. There are also functioning four stations in a special zone for problem \nareas to carry out research on rice, pokkali rice etc., and to address the problems of Kuttanadu \nand Onattukara regions. In Onattukara zone one station is functioning for conducting research on \nOnattukara coconut. In southern zone four stations are functioning for various crop \nimprovement, research and extension services. 3.4 Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS) \nRegional Agricultural Research Station comes under the Kerala Agricultural University and is \nlocated at Pattambi, Palakkad district. The lead function of the station is to conduct research \nmainly on rice, pulses, horticultural crops and rice-based farming systems. The institute aims at \nsustainable food production by providing technology backup for better production and safe \nproduction practices. It also aims at rendering basic knowledge and practical experience in the \nfield to the youngsters who are interested in agriculture through its academic programmes. The \nstation was upgraded as Regional Agricultural Research Station for Central Zone comprising of \nErnakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad and Malappuram districtsunder the National Agricultural \nResearch Programme (NARP) in 1981. The first high yielding hybrid derivative variety of rice \nof South-East Asia ―Annapoorna (Ptb-35)‖ was released for cultivation by this station in 1966. RARS is concentrating on the collection and conservation of rice diversity in the state, which is \nthe most important crop of Kerala. There were three major seasons in Kerala for paddy \ncultivation i.e., Virippu (April-May to September-October),Mundakan (July-August to February-\nMarch) and Puncha (January-February to April-May). More than thousands of rice varieties, \nwhich were in cultivation during different seasons, have been collected and conserved in a well \nmaintained deep-freeze laboratory. Traditional varieties of paddy were well suited for the \ndifferent agro-climatic conditions in the state. The conservation of such varieties without losing \nits traits has been maintained in the centre. The RARS is providing traditional varieties of rice to \nfarmers who are interested in their cultivation. Such varieties can be considered as parent seeds \nfor breeding purposes for getting new traits and advantages through the research. The RARS is \nmaintaining acres of paddy land for the cultivation of rice varieties to get their new seeds for the \npurpose of conservation. Based on different rice varieties, there are different time periods.",

Eraviperoor has become the first grama panchayat in the country to receive a national award for \npublic administration. Moreover, this is also the maiden public administration award received by \nan institution or individual from Kerala. Eraviperoor grama panchayat has been recognised and \nawarded from several times for its excellence in the service delivery and now it becomes \nEraviperoormodel, which is replicating 12 States. In 2013, Eraviperoor was selected for the award for biodiversity conservation instituted by the \nState Biodiversity Board and the Sanitation Award of the State Sanitation Mission. In the same \nyear, the state Horticulture Department selected the village as a model hi-tech green village on \naccount of banana plantations by 42 women groups who cooperated with each other to earn \nprofits not just for themselves, but also for the village. This is the only panchayat in the state has \nreceived ISO-9001 certification for it's Primary Health Centre (PHC). It has also won the state \ngovernment‘s Health Award and Pain and Palliative Care Award for 2014-15. Now the PHC is \nconverted as Family Health Centre (FHC) under Aardram Mission of Government of Kerala. FHC is functioning with ample facilities of Yoga, Fitness Centres etc. with the integration of the \nAyush project. As far as the activities of Biodiversity Management Committee (BMC) are \nconcerned, the panchayat was chosen for the award for Best BMC from National Biodiversity \nAuthority in 2018. Eraviperoor became the first grama panchayat in the country to provide free Wi-Fi to the general \npublic. Villagers can access free Wi-Fi facility within a one-kilometre radius of five different \npanchayat institutions. Besides this, the panchayat has touch screen kiosks for the public to \nlocate their files in ultra-modern Panchayat record rooms. The panchayat has given priority to e-\ngovernance at the grassroots level. It is reported that the panchayat is planning to implement \n‗Panchayat to People Kiosks‘ programme under its own risk. People can access the services of \npanchayat within their locality through these Kiosks. Software has been developed to implement \nthis programme. BMC \nBMC was initially constituted on 10/12/2010 and reconstituted on 18/01/2015 with a \nchairperson, convenor, secretary and seven members. The major mandate of the BMC was the \npreparation of Peoples Biodiversity Register (PBR) in the beginning period; it was prepared on \nFebruary 2011. The panchayat officials reported that BMC is functioning with three major areas, \ni.e., water conservation, food security and protection of the environment. Water conservation \nThe panchayat constructed 1.45 lakhs rain pits for groundwater recharging under the monitoring \nof BMC. Protection and reformation of traditional water bodies, and mini drinking water \nprojects, Sujalam drinking water project in association with the M S Swaminathan Foundation \nare the other projects implementing underwater conservation. PBR \nBMC reported that technical supports and capacity building had been received from state \nBiodiversity Board in the initial period for the preparation of PBR. Within the one year period, \nthe whole process of preparation of PBR had been completed. The survey group for each ward \nhad been formulated comprising of Kudumbashree members, local people and students to collect \ndata. Total of 63 persons had been engaged in the survey for all wards. The survey had been \ncompleted within two months. There was no delay in preparation of PBR. Eraviperoor became \nthe first grama panchayat in Pathanamthitta district in preparation of PBR. Financial support \n \n 45 \n \n \n \nfrom KSBB has been received by the panchayat for the preparation of PBR, creation of Star \nForest and Carbon Neutral Project. BMC has prepared a project as part of its Action Plan for the construction of organic fertiliser \nunit. This unit will collect all type of organic waste from the panchayat area for the processing of \nfertiliser. It is expected to avoid chemical fertilisers from the agricultural sector by supplying \nthis organic fertiliser for the cultivation of Eraviperoor Rice and other agricultural crops. Organic farming has been promoting in the agricultural sector, especially for vegetables, but \nfarmers are using chemical fertilisers in the paddy cultivation (Eraviperoor rice) extensively. There was no separate scheme prepared for the protection of Kaavu,-wetland ecosystems. Annual review of PBR has not been conducted so far. As far as protection of natural resources is \nconcerned, BMC is planning to implement ‗Tree Pledging instead of Cutting‘ Project, Varattar \nProtection Scheme, Implementation of user fee for the houses having tiled courtyard etc. As per the PBR data, nearly 140 varieties of agricultural crops have been cultivated including \nfood crops, cash crops, spices, vegetables and tubers. Out of this 35 varieties of vegetables and \n40 varieties of tubers had been identified. In the PBR, 104 varieties of medicinal plants, 76 wild \nanimals, 10 items of flora and 15 items of fauna in the water bodies, had been recorded. Only 24 \nvarieties of livestock and pets are being reared in the Panchayat. Two rivers (Varattar and \nManimala), one canal and 4 thodu (water streams) and 2 ponds (under private custody) have \nbeen identified as water bodies within the panchayat area. BMC reported that PBR has to be \nupdated and digitalised by adding up of new data based on the new survey. It is expected to be \nachieved within a short period of time. From the field level observation,Eraviperoor panchayat is ensuring the involvement of BMC in \nthe process of implementation of several conventional projects of grama panchayats also like \nconstruction of rain pits, agricultural promotion, providing drinking water etc., given these \nprojects are related to environment assets. Rejuvenation of Varattar river, efforts for removing \nencroachments, etc., were the outstanding measures in front of the environment protection. A \nnotable point is that conducting Eco-Grama Sabha in all wards was a unique attempt of \nEraviperoor grama panchayat and it generated environmental awareness among the people. It \nalso encouraged disclosing more suggestions and ensuring the participation of people in \nenvironment conservation. 4.2.1 Varattar-Aadi Pamba rejuvenation \nThe most important activity of BMC was the rejuvenation of a river - -Varattar and Aadi Pamba. Varattaar is a tributary of Aadi Pamba and it reaches Manimala River. Varattar was the main \nsource of water for hundreds of households in its earlier period. This river had a natural \nimportance that acted as a natural flood control mechanism between Pamba and Manimala \nrivers, carrying the excess water from both ways. Due to the land encroachment and sand \nmining, it became a drought river forthelast 35 years, and some people were using the banks of \nthis area for cultivation purpose. The grama panchayat has taken initiatives to sketch out the \nboundaries of the river using land records. It is reported that there were many hurdles that had \ntobefaced in the initial time. BMC prepared an action plan under MGNREGS to rejuvenate the \nriver, and the activities started in 2013-14. The rejuvenation activities were implemented with \nthe people‘s participation. All obstructions towards the natural pathway of the river were \nremoved by cleaning and chopping away of branches of trees by MGNREGS workers and local \npeople, and removal culverts across the river. 46 \n \n \n \n \nCreation of river pathway \n(Photo is taken from Panchayat records-PPT slides) \n \n13.5 acres of riverbank has been regained with the magnificent efforts of the panchayat. The \nDPR is prepared and submitted to the Haritha KeralamMission. The first stage has been \ncompleted within 3 months without any government aid, but Rs.80 crore has been announced for \nthe rejuvenation by the state government in the second stage. Varattar is flowing through the nearest local governments of Eraviperoor, i.e. Koippram and \nKuttoor panchayats and Chengannoor municipality. Eraviperoor panchayat has triggered actions \natthe beginning for the rejuvenation of Varattaar. It generated a compulsion to participate in \nother nearest local governments which are sharing the banks of Varattar. The rejuvenation of the \nriver programme has become the major environmental conservation programme of nearest \npanchayats and Chengannoor municipality along with Eraviperoor panchayat with the support of \ndistrict administration and Haritha Keralam Mission. Varatte...Aaru.....(Let river come) Riverwalk campaign was organised by the local governments \nand hundreds of people gathered on the banks of Varattar river including political leaders, \nministers and MLAs. It was a noticeable campaign, and it created awareness among the local \npeople about the importance to rejuvenate the river. The river rejuvenation programme comes \nunder the purview of state recognised River Rejuvenation Scheme now. Riverwalk campaign  \n \n \nThe flowing river  \n(Phots are taken from Panchayat records-PPT slides) \n \nThe grama panchayat has taken measures to remove all obstructions in the beginning part of the \nVarattar that connects with Aadi Pamba. This connecting point of Varattar with Aadi Pamba is a \ncrucial place to ensure the water flow of Varattar from Aadi Pamba. The major efforts of river \nrejuvenation process of Eraviperoor grama panchayat havebeen executed in this area. The river \nstarted flowing through its forgotten path once the path was almost cleared by the abundant \nmonsoon rain. The boat race has been conducted in the river Aadi Pamba with the initiatives of \ngrama panachayat. This was a true festival for the people and they had celebrated immensely. 47 \n \n \n \nBut Varattar has dried up now due to the scorching summer. Water flow can be seen only in a \nfew places of the river. Sand wall and other types of blockages have been restricting the natural \nflow of Varattar. It is expected that the water flow will be restored after the monsoon. According \nto the Panchayat, more actionisneeded again to revive the river with the participation of nearest \nlocal governments. The present condition of Varattar is a dried river as shown below. Present condition of Varattaar  \n(Photo is taken during our field visit) \n \n \n4.2.2 Food security \nEraviperoor panchayat introduced a scheme for paddy cultivation with an aim to achieve self-\nsufficiency in rice production. The panchayat has identified 40-hectare fallow lands and has \ntaken from the owners on the basis of lease and handed over to the farmers for the cultivation. An agreement has been executed by the panchayat with landowners. Seed, fertilisers and other \ninfrastructures have been provided by the panchayat in association with Krishi Bhavan. Panchayat has created irrigation facilities for the paddy cultivation in the fallow land using \nMGNREGS workers. A fifteen-member Kudumbasree entrepreneur group named as \n‘Swadesabhimani’ procure paddy from the farmers at the support price fixed by the government \nwith the fostering of the panchayat. After processing, the rice is packed in 5 kg and 10 kg cloth \nbags and soldto the needy people in the brand name of ‘Eraviperoor Rice’. A cloth bag unit is \nalso functioning with the financial support of the panchayat. The subsidies for the procurement \nand marketing have been provided by the panchayat with the help of Kudumbasree Mission in \nthe initial time. It is reported that Kudumbasree unit has now become profitable, and they are \nactively engaged in procurement, processing and marketing. The Kudumbasree members \nreported that panchayat is monitoring the functions of the unit and providing all kinds of \nnecessary supports. In the absence of rice processing mill in the panchayat area, they depend on \nthe nearest district for the paddy processing. Therefore panchayat is planning to establish their \nown rice processing mill with modern facilities, and it is expected to reducethe production cost \nof Eraviperoor Rice. 4.2.3 Environment \nEraviperoor grama panchayat has organised a special grama sabha- ‗Eco-grama sabha‘- in all the \nwards for environment conservation. It was the best method to spread environment awareness to \nthe people. All suggestions emerged from the grama sabha have been recorded and formulated in \nan action plan based on it. Waste management is one of the important activities of the panchayat. A plastic shredding unit has been functioning in the panchayat, and it is also providing \nemployment to a few women. Plastic waste is being collected from the houses and institutions \nevery month by KudumbasreeHarithakarmaSena at the rate of Rs.30/- per household. These \nplastics are dumped into the plastic shredding unit for the processing. After shredding process, \nthe plastics are handed over for the use of road tarring. It is reported that people from \n \n 48 \n \n \n \noutsidethepanchayat area are also collecting these processed plastics for road tarring \npurpose,therebygeneratinga reasonable income. Panchayat officials have reported that the \nmaintenance cost of the road can be reduced through the promotion of plastic tarring roads. As \nper the records, 6714.5 kg plastics havebeen collected during the period from 2012-13 to 2017-\n18, out of it 5284 kg was used for road tarring and generated Rs.60650/- as income.15 A scheme \nfor construction of compost pits in all households is also introduced for the processing of organic \nwaste. Varieties of trees have been planted in the panchayat area through the afforestation activity by \nutilising MGNREGS labourers. Medicinal plants are also planted in the premises of Family \nHealth Centre. The QR code has been created for each plant and placed in it to get all \ninformation related to each plant. Lakhs of Areca nut tree have been planted in Aadipamba –\nVarattar area. Panchayat has released all encroachments in this area and planted Areca nut tree \nwith the aim of getting Areca nut leaves (paala- local name) for the famous Hindu cultural \nfestival ‗padayani‘. Arecanut tree and its leaves- paala is an important item for the Padayani \nfestival. Planting trees and medicinal plants and its conservation is an important activity of the \npanchayat in keeping with environment protection which is monitored by the BMC. The \nPresident of the panchayat said that littering waste and chopping trees are punishable in the \npanchayat area. A camera has been installed in important places, and panchayat will impose fine \nas per the recommendations of BMC. Reducing street light billing to zero is another mission of BMC by fixing solar panels over \npanchayat and transferred offices. BMC reported that an effort had been taken to digitalise the \nPBR. BMC is planning to collect biodiversity data once again for the digitalisation. Along with \nthis carbon-neutral study is ongoing now. The survey has been conducted in some wards of the \npanchayat to get the information related to the volume of carbon emission from each household \nand institution. A special grama sabha for carbon-neutral has been organised. The panchayat \naims to become carbon-neutral village in 2020-21 by planting trees, reducing plastics and all \ntype of pollutions. 4.3 Meenangadi Grama Panchayat- Creation of an artificial forest and becoming the \n first carbon-neutral panchayat in India \n \n \n \n \nProfile:Meenangadi grama panchayat (GP) is located 1022 meter above the sea level and \nbelongs to Sultan Battery Block Panchayat of Wayanadu district. The total area is 53.51 sq.km \n                                                                 \n15Data from panchayat records (PPT slides) \n \n 49 \n \n \n \nand having 19 wards and 8199 families. According to the Census 2011, the total population of \nthe Panchayat is 33450. The average rainfall is 221 mm16. The major occupation of the people is \nagriculture and livestock rearing. The total agriculture area is 4919 ha., and major crops \ncultivated in the area are paddy, coffee, pepper, plantains, coconut, rubber, areca nut, ginger, \nturmeric, tapioca, elephant foot yam, great yam, taro root etc. The Panchayat is prosperous with \nfour rivers i.e., Nurasipuzha, Purakkadipuzha, Chundalipuzha,Kuttirayinpuzha and 23 streams. The forest area is 2.7 percent of the total area of the Panchayat. A lot of public institutions are \nfunctioning in the Panchayat area. The public infrastructure comprising road connectivity, \ndrinking water, electricity is also good. Besides this, the National Highway NH 766 (212), and \nState Highway pass through the panchayat area. BMC \nBMC of Meenagadi GP was formed in 2008. This is one of the first GPs in Wayanad who \nprepared People‘s Biodiversity Register (PBR). BMC was reconstituted on 14/11/2016. The \nPanchayat has appointed an active environmentalist Shri.Pavithran Master who is a retired \ngovernment School headmaster, as the convenor of BMC. BMC has been functioning very \nactivelyand an Action Plan for environment conservation has been formulated since then. BMC \nis actively involved in the environment preservation activities apart from the preparation of PBR, \nwhich include conducting carbon-neutral study, the formation of Manikavu Bamboo Park, \nconducting biodiversity study- Kolagappara, Kavukal, seed bank, School level club activities, \nPBR updation etc. The immense support from active NGOs like MSSRF has been noted as \ncrucial in the activities of BMC. In 2018 Meenangadi won the best BMC award from the State Biodiversity Board and received a \nspecial mention from the National Biodiversity Authority. The BMC is functioning \nsystematically in Meenangadi GP. The BMC meetings are organise every three months and \nminutes are maintained in the office. A separate office room is provided for the functions of \nBMC. The Rapid Assessment of Biodiversity loss due to floods and landslides has been \ncompleted with the support of MSSRF recently. 4.3.1 Activities of BMC \nCarbon-Neutral Panchayat-More actions have been taken by Meenangadi with the aim of \nbecoming India‘s first carbon-neutral panchayat. Carbon emission was estimated from \ntransportation, energy, waste, Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU). Meenangadi \nhas conducted a waste audit and energy audit in households and institutions to measure the \nquantities of waste generation and energy emissions. Similarly, the emission from transportation \nhas also been calculated. The carbon-neutral study has been conducted with the support of \nexperts and NGO-Thanal-. Further actions have been coordinated by BMC with the frequent \nconsultation with eminent experts, IIT researchers, experts from leading universities etc. based \non the recommendations of the study. The efforts of Meenangadi are valuable and effectual in \nthe context of Wayanad,whichis one of the districts in the state that are labelled climate change \nhotspots. Punyavanam – It is an artificial forest engendered by BMC in 44 acres of land. It has been \nconservedasa forest with the support of MSSRF, Social forestry and MGNREGS since 2005. MSSRF was the key player from 2005; later the panchayat and BMC have been involved \nactively from 2012 to create an artificial forest with the support of MGNREGS and social \n                                                                 \n16Data taken from Development Report of Meenangadi Grama Panchayat \n \n 50 \n \n \n \nforestry. Trees belong to 115 species of the Western Ghats region have been planted in \nPunyavanam, and now it became a forest having varieties of trees, birds and animals. Pathirippara-Conservation and studies about biodiversity-A study has been conducted on the \nbiodiversity system in Pathirippara under the monitoring of BMC with the support of MSSRF. The floristic study conducted by MSSRF, documented a total number of 142 taxa of flowering \nplants belonging to 123 genera and 54 families from this area. Dicotyledons dominate with 123 \nSpecies belonging to 108 genera 45 families constitute 86.6 percent of total flora and \nmonocotyledons have 19 species 15 genera from 8 families constitute 13.4 percent of floristic \nrichness in this rocky area17. This area has been conserving and protecting from rock mining and \nunauthorised human interventions. The panchayat is planning to explore this area for an eco-\ntourism point. Protection of Kaavu and Keni- BMC conducted studies on 48 Kaavu and traditional Keni \nprotecting by tribes. Protection of 48 Kaavu and promotion of traditional knowledge sharing is \none of the major activities of BMC. Traditional Keni (small water well constructed by tribes having crystal clear water) is an \nimportant water source of tribes, and they are considering this as holy water. A day of tribe \nfamily starts with this holy water, and it has natural and cultural importance. The water level of \nthese Kenis will not change even in the drought situation. Conversion of Barren land into cultivable land-Panchayat has identified acres of barren land after \ncutting teak which was distributed by the government to the tribes for their housing and \nlivelihood in accordance with the Forest Right Act. This area was completely barren and \nisolated; nothing can be cultivated. The panchayat has taken a mission to implement livelihood \nagricultural project i.e., Agro root and Agro veg in this area. Tribes were not interested in living \nin this area because of the isolation and uncultivable barren land. Panchayat implemented Agro \nroot project(supplying various kinds of tubers seeds for cultivation) with the labour support from \nMGNREGS. Tribes of this area are also included in the MGNREGS scheme so that they had \ncultivated in their own land with the government wage. This kind of support of panchayat \ncreated motivation for cultivation and attracted tribes to live there. Similarly,Agro veg project \n(supplying various kinds of vegetable seeds for cultivation)wasimplemented. Apart from this, \nvarious kinds of trees have been planted through afforestation activities in this area. There was \nno well water in earlier times. Six water wells are functioning now in this area after creating rain \npits and greenery. Tribes are cultivating various kinds of vegetables and tubers and rearing live \nstocks in this area for their needs and selling purpose. Now the area can be seen as a normal \ngreenery living place with the fabulous and exemplary attempts of panchayat and BMC. Community Seed Bank-The measures have been taken for the conservation and extension of \ntraditional varieties of crops especially paddy, pepper and tubers. The panchayat has identified \nfarmers who have been cultivating the traditional crops and created a directory of farmers. The \ntechnical assistance, awareness, public recognition, seed fest, subsidies for cultivation etc.",

    "It also aims at identifying policy area which needs further careful attention and research. The study employs a mix of primary and secondary source material. Primary sources include a \ndetailed survey of major public research institutions in the state which generate the formalised \nknowledge for maintaining agrobiodiversity . It has also covered some of the leading NGOs in \nthe field. Further, we have surveyed some of the model BMCs in the state. Secondary source \nmaterials include a critical analysis of major policy documents dealing with agrobiodiversityboth \nin a direct and indirect manner. Organisation of the study  \nThe paper is structured into six sections. Section 1 discusses the main institutional mechanism \nthat is available for maintaining biodiversity in general and agrobiodiversity in particular at the \nlevel. This is basically the Biodiversity Management Committees and the People‘s Biodiversity \nRegisters (PBRs). Section 2 evaluates the various laws policies that favour or hinder \nagrobiodiversity in the state. These range from the policy on biodiversity itself to the one on \nenvironment and the agricultural policy of the state to laws regarding Intellectual Property \nRights (IPRs) in general.

    "2.2The Kerala State EnvironmentPolicy, 2009 \nThe environment policy has many provisions to maintain biodiversity ingeneral and \nagrobiodiversity in particular.Section 11 has 17 suchprovisions. The most important of these is \nthe formation,collection and record of local agrobiodiversity data in People‘s Biodiversity \nRegisters (PBR) at the panchayat level and the discouraging of monocultures in cropping?. According to the data from the Biodiversity Board, only 7 districts out of 14 have completed the \nformation of PBRs in all the Panchayats within a district. Further, the following comments could also be made: \n Though there are a number of strategies and action plans envisaged inKerala State \nEnvironment Policy and also by the KSBB, the details on financial allocations for these \nactions and how theseare being implemented are not clear. Hence, some of these \nstrategies andaction plans may be remaining as mere wish statements.  There is a need to strategize the protection of biodiversity.How?  Given the broad climatic characteristics of the state, the same plant species or variety \nmay be prevalent in multiple locations. Some ofthese may be useful to individuals and \nhouseholds, and hence they mayhave the incentive to conserve it.  However, private incentives may not be that high to conserve all kinds ofplants, species \nand genetic diversity (and that is the need for publicintervention in the form of the \nprovision of subsidies or regulations).  There is a resource-cost in both the provision of subsidies and also regulation. It is not \nclear whether such costs are estimated, and whether provisions are made to allocate \npublic resources for this purpose.",
    "  The attempt seems to be a wishful effort to protect agro-biodiversity in all places \nwherever these are available. This may not be a realistic target.   If the enforcement effort of the state is going to be targeted to all such localities, then it \nmay get diluted, and there could be land-use changes that may destroy biodiversity in \nmany localities.  It may be noted that agrobiodiversity prevails mostly in private lands, and the reach of \nthe state is limited in such lands compared to forests which are owned by the \ngovernment. Hence it may be desirable to have a prioritization of the agrobiodiversity to \nbe protected. 2.3The Organic Farming Policy \nThe stated purpose of this State policy is ‗to protect its rich biodiversity and thus sustain various \nlivelihoods dependent on this precious resource‘. In that sense, the connection between the \n                                                                 \n8Cotton is grown in a small area in Attappadi  in Palghat district. 13 \n \n \n \nprotection of agrobiodiversity and organic farming is envisaged before the formulation of this \npolicy. The policy was proposed and initiated by the KSBB.  Though the preamble of the policy is written in a severely non-rigorous manner, it has \ncertain positive implications for the protection of agrobiodiversity in Kerala.  The policy notes the reality that the intensity of inorganic agriculture in Kerala is not that \nhigh, and hence has the potential to move towards organic farming. Further, the policy \nnotes `the positive side of agriculture in Kerala in terms of the already low levels of \nconsumption of hazardous chemicals and, therefore, chances of redeeming farmers to \norganic agriculture are quite high‘ (p.5).",
    "In any case, data from \nthe Farm Information (undated) shows that the total area under certified organic farms in \nKottayam district is only about 37 hectares- working out to an insignificant percentage of area \nunder organic cultivation in the state. 13.49\n0.99\n6.75\n4.05\n74.73\nWayanad\nKottayam\nMalappuram\nKozhikode\nIdukki\n \n 17 \n \n \n \n2.4Agricultural Development Policy \nAnother policy having a bearing on agrobiodiversity is the Agricultural Development Policy \n2015 of the state. The policy has 46 sub-policies. Although none of these is specificto \nbiodiversity despite the fact that one of the much-asserted objectives of the policy is to make \n―Kerala a biodiversity paradise‖. However,the CDSteam has identified 10 sub-policies that have \nthe potential to either support agrobiodiversity or have a negative impact on it. Of the 19, 9 have \na positive impact, and 1 may have a negative impact. The suggested policies in Agricultural Development Policy, 2015, which may have an impact on \nthe protection of agrobiodiversity, are listed in Table 3.

    "2.7.2Access Benefit Sharing \nThe Nagoya protocol on Biodiversityemphasizes the access to the genetic resources and its fair \nand equitable benefit sharing of genetic resources. This is known as Access Benefit Sharing \n(ABS). As per Section 7 of Biodiversity Act 2002 and Section 16 of Kerala Biological Diversity \nRule, 2008, any Indian citizen or body corporate or association or registered organization should \nseek approval of the KSBB for access to collection of biological resources in Kerala for \ncommercial utilization. The transition to an ABS regime is a priority area identified by the State \nPlanning Board, in its working group report on biodiversity for the 13th Five Year Plan (Kerala \nState Planning Board, 2017). Chapter 9 of the working group report deals with ABS. It proposes \na statewide scheme for documenting commercially tradablebio resources and industries utilising \nthe resources. The report calls for equipping panchayat-level Biodiversity Management \nCommittees (BMCs) with negotiating skills to maximise the returns from trade in bioresources \nunder the ABS regime. The BMC would be authorised to levy collection fee for accessing \nbiological resources for commercial purposes. The levy would be deposited in a local \nbiodiversity fund and utilised for conservation activities. According to press reports11, the \nKSBB had identified 2,694 industrial units including Ayurvedic drug companies, tea and coffee \nmanufacturers, agro-based units, food and fruit processing centres, leather, cashew, textiles, \npaper, rubber, coir, spices, wood and bamboo-based industries and exporters of these products \nthat were liable to pay a part of their sales revenue for access to bioresources and associated \ntraditional knowlededge into a fund to be denoted as Local Biodiversity Fund.",
    "In present global \nscenario of climate change, tuber crops are gaining visibility as Future Smart Crops for climate \nresilience, low input cost and also for being rich in calorie, dietary fibers, minerals, vitamins \nand anti-oxidants (Research Highlights-2017-18, CTCRI). CTCRI is carrying out the \ndevelopment of tuber crops to ensure nutritional food and livelihood enhancement for the rural \npeople. The Centre organizes awareness training programmes, technical assistance, an \nincubator facility for the production of value-added products from tuber crops to farmers, \n \n 26 \n \n \n \nentrepreneurs, etc., The Centre also strives to popularize various kinds of tuber cultivation \namong the farmers. New varieties of tubers of high yield and disease-resistant have been \ndeveloped. The centre is conserving 15 species of tubers including cassava, sweet potato, yam, taro etc. The centre is also maintaining related species like 13 species of Greater yam, Lesser yam, \nPotato yam, 6 species of Taro, 8 species of Elephant yam, 4 species of Chinese potato, 8 species \nof Minor arrowroot, one species of minor wild tubers and one species of Asparagus. A total of \n5570 accessions comprising 1211 cassava, 1124 sweet potato, 1110 yams, 683 edible aroids, \n200 minor tuber crops and 1242 collections from Regional Centre (RC) were maintained and \nconserved in the field gene bank of CTCRI. It is reported that new collections were added to the \nexisting germplasm from various sources in sweet potato (20), yams (3), edible aroids (1) and \nminor tuber crops (15). The centredeveloped 67 new varieties of various kinds of tubers.",

Other poultries including ducks, \nquails, ornamental poultries, etc., are alsoconservedin the farm. Schemes like Aiswarya have \nbeen introduced to propagate poultry to increase egg production in the state. Gothra Mission  \nBeing the largest institute for higher education in Wayanad and the only university of the \ndistrict, KVASU has taken a responsibility to participate in the efforts of the Government of \nKerala to work for the upliftment of tribal people. A new project, namely ‗Gothra Mission‘ has \nbeen introduced in this respect. Gothra Mission was formally inaugurated by the Hon. Governor \nof Kerala on 6th April, 2019. Today, tribes lead a marginalized life, far from the freedom they \nonce enjoyed in nature, forced to live in restricted spaces under extreme poverty and \nexploitation, having to depend on settlers for subsistence mostly as agricultural labourers. Poor \neducation and alcoholism are serious concerns among them. It is reported that KVASU having 100 acres of land, a large number of students and teaching \nfaculty with expertise in all areas associated with animal husbandry and allied areas, including \ncourses, training programmes and infrastructure suitable for training tribal youth for alternate \nlivelihood activities, are the advantages in tribal welfare work.",
    "The state has been divided into six agro-ecological zones by KAU to carry out research and \nextension of various crops based on location specificity. The zones are northern, high range, \ncentral, special zone for problem areas, Onattukara and southern zone.Two research stations are \nfunctioning in the Northern Zone for coconut and pepper. Regional Agricultural Research \nStation (RARS), Pilicode maintains a unique collection of coconut germplasm consisting of 35 \nexotic and 40 indigenous types and the research on hybridisation for getting high yield are being \ncarried out. Pepper Research Station, Panniyur has released five varieties of pepper, viz. Panniyur-1, Panniyur-2, Panniyur-3, Panniyur-4 and Panniyur-5 through their research and all \nare well received by the farmers. Two research stations are functioning to provide research \nsupport for agriculture in the High Range zone (Wayanad and Idukki districts and \nNelliyampathy area of Palakkad district). RARS, Ambalavayal(Wayanadu) concentrates on rice, \nspices and vegetables and serves as a major hub for the supply of seeds and planting materials of \nvarious crops. Cardamom Research Station, Pampadumpara is a substation of RARS \n \n 31 \n \n \n \nAmbalavayal and the station is maintaining a germplasm bank of 77 cultivated and 14 wild types \nof cardamom. In central zone, nine research stations are functioning for providing research and \nextension services for rice, banana, cashew, vegetables, medicinal plants, pineapple, passion \nfruit etc. Various crop varieties including banana, cashew has been released for cultivation \nthrough these centres.",
    "There are also functioning four stations in a special zone for problem \nareas to carry out research on rice, pokkali rice etc., and to address the problems of Kuttanadu \nand Onattukara regions. In Onattukara zone one station is functioning for conducting research on \nOnattukara coconut. In southern zone four stations are functioning for various crop \nimprovement, research and extension services. 3.4 Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS) \nRegional Agricultural Research Station comes under the Kerala Agricultural University and is \nlocated at Pattambi, Palakkad district. The lead function of the station is to conduct research \nmainly on rice, pulses, horticultural crops and rice-based farming systems. The institute aims at \nsustainable food production by providing technology backup for better production and safe \nproduction practices. It also aims at rendering basic knowledge and practical experience in the \nfield to the youngsters who are interested in agriculture through its academic programmes. The \nstation was upgraded as Regional Agricultural Research Station for Central Zone comprising of \nErnakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad and Malappuram districtsunder the National Agricultural \nResearch Programme (NARP) in 1981. The first high yielding hybrid derivative variety of rice \nof South-East Asia ―Annapoorna (Ptb-35)‖ was released for cultivation by this station in 1966. RARS is concentrating on the collection and conservation of rice diversity in the state, which is \nthe most important crop of Kerala. There were three major seasons in Kerala for paddy \ncultivation i.e., Virippu (April-May to September-October),Mundakan (July-August to February-\nMarch) and Puncha (January-February to April-May).",
    "Carbon emission was \nestimated from transportation, energy, waste, Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use \n(AFOLU). This has motivated other grama panchayats to assess carbon emission to address \nclimate change. It could thus be seen that the two non-governmental organizations are playing a very important \nrole in diffusing technology to farmers and also in conserving a number of crop species thereby \nsaving it from extinction and (re)introducing them into everyday use. 3.7 PRIs dealing with biodiversity in general \n3.7.1 Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanical Garden Research Institute (JNTBGRI) \nJNTBGRI was established in 1979 under Government of Kerala as an autonomous institution \nand located at Palode, foothills of the Western Ghats, Thiruvananthapuram.

New varieties have been developed through crop improvement for high yield, disease \nresistance, etc. 3. Institutions are facing challenges and limitations in the extension services. Only \npassionate farmers or interested agencies are utilising the services of these institutions. Lack of proper knowledge about these institutions and the importance of agricultural \npractices among the public are serious concerns. 4. In view of the extension possibilities, NGOs are seen to be performing better as \ncompared to the government institutions, by collaborating with local governments and \n \n 40 \n \n \n \nintervention at grassroots level through community mobilisation.

    "BMC members reported \nthat the survey team comprising of Kudumbasree members, local people (who had traditional \nknowledge), students etc. have been deputed for each ward to collect the data. Each team \nconsisted of nearly 20 people who are actively involved in the survey. They have collected \ninformation from the ward level and then consolidated it as per the guidance from the KSSB \ncoordinators. The coordinators of KSBB have visited the Panchayat and have given orientation \ntraining to the survey team. The preparation of PBR was completed within three months. Yearly \nupdation of the PBR seems to be missing in this panchayat. Therefore, verification of the bio-\ndiversity and species mentioned in the PBR was not possible. Moreover, the BMC was not \nactive after this exercise. In 2015, BMC was reconstituted by the Panchayat but no Action Plan \nhas been formulated since then. The PBR is not updated and it is reported that they have not \nreceived any clear order from KSBB for the updation of PBR. Annual review of PBR has not \nbeen conducted so far. Agrobiodiversity of the Panchayat is significant as per the PBR. In the Panchayat 120 species of \nvarious crops are being cultivated. It includes 10 varieties of paddy and coconut, 41 varieties of \n12 vegetables, 8 varieties of tapioca, 9 varieties of yam and 18 varieties of other tubers.

    "All these \nare important from the public policy point of view. Role of Local Self Government Units in promoting agrobiodiversity in their panchayat: \nThe current mode is through the formation of Biodiversity Management Committees and the \ndocumentation of biodiversity at a particular point in time through the preparation of People‘s \nBiodiversity Registers (PBRs). During our field research in four model panchayats we found that \nthis was not working at all. Most of the BMCs have been dysfunctional, and PBRs once framed \nare never updated. It must be digitised an annual auditing by an accredited agency should be \nencouraged. It is important that the state government put in place some financial incentive \nschemes for proper functioning of the BMCs. The proposed research should focus on the type \nand size of this financial incentive scheme. In this context, although the government has constituted a 13th working group on environment, \nbiodiversity and climate change with BMC as members, their role has remained merely  \nadvisory and so far  no funds have been allocated to them as well. Role of Government Research Institutes in developing knowledge for mainstreaming \nagrobiodiversity: There are a number of public research institutes in the state focusing on \nagrobiodiversity. However, they have been functioning in a vacuum, often doing research \nwithout any coordination with the Biodiversity Board. This coordination could be achieved by \nlinking these institutes to the Kerala State Biodiversity Board so that an annual research plan be \nmade and a consortium be formed to develop the requisite knowledge.",

    "In general, a higher level of diversity could be useful on three counts.",
    "There are three kinds of \nvalues of agrobiodiversity.",
    "First is the use-value – some of the diverse variety of flora, fauna and \ngenes could be directly useful for people (including cultivators).",
    "For example, there could \ndifferent plants and animals that cultivators sustain as a source of subsistence or income.",
    "The \nagro-diversity might have served the function of a portfolio diversification to address risks in \nless developed societies which do not have formal institutions for insurance or risk minimisation \n(Kontoleon et al., 2009).",
    "For example, there could \nbe some plants in farms that may have a medicinal use for human beings or animals; there could \nbe some others which can be used as organic or natural pesticides, and so on.",
    "Though some of the varieties are not known to be \nuseful with the current information, some of these may turn out to be useful based on future \nknowledge.",

A: Local bodies have also \nbeen charged with the management of invasive species.Further, the committee has recommended \nthe preparation of a city biodiversity index for Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, and Kozhikode, \nafforestation of public land in urban areas, eco-restoration of water bodiesand establishment of \nbiodiversity parks. All these go on the way towards mainstreaming biodiversity in general at the \nstate. Regarding agrobiodiversity, the working group recommended 14 suggestions 7 . These \nrange from development of village level seed bank and a seed management committee, \nmaintaining  agrobiodiversity inventory at LSG level through PBR, maintenance of databases \nrelated to Traditional Knowledge, promotion of studies on diversity of natural pollinators and \npredators in the agroecosystem, more attention on the underutilized species as tubers, green leafy \nvegetables, revitalization of organic farming by employing the provisions of Participatory \nGuarantee Scheme (PGS), conservation of local varieties, encouraging boundary bund planting \nin paddy fields, rubber and coconut plantations etc. The Planning Board is in the process of \nimplementing these suggestions. The megafloods in several parts of Kerala in August 2018 seemed to have seriously affected the \nbiodiversity of the state. The post-flood biodiversity impact study conducted by KSBB (Kerala \nState Biodiversity Board, 2018)has drawn up a three-pronged strategy to address the impact of \nthe floods on the ecology and biodiversity of the State. The rapid assessment is to be followed by \na chain study to understand how the disaster has affected various ecosystems. The third part of \nthe strategy will focus on developing a long-term action plan for ecological restoration. Chapter \n4 of the study documents the district-wise impact of mega floods and landslides on \nagrobiodiversity. The crop worst affected was paddy across 12 of the 14 districts. Overall in \nboth India and Kerala, the share of agriculture in the nation and state‘s economy has been \ndeclining. Objectives,  methodology and data sources \nThe primary purpose of the study is to understand the policies and that institutions that Kerala \nstate and India has put in place to successfully manage and conserve agrobiodiversity in the \nstate. It also aims at identifying policy area which needs further careful attention and research. The study employs a mix of primary and secondary source material. Primary sources include a \ndetailed survey of major public research institutions in the state which generate the formalised \nknowledge for maintaining agrobiodiversity . It has also covered some of the leading NGOs in \nthe field. Further, we have surveyed some of the model BMCs in the state. Secondary source \nmaterials include a critical analysis of major policy documents dealing with agrobiodiversityboth \nin a direct and indirect manner. Organisation of the study  \nThe paper is structured into six sections. Section 1 discusses the main institutional mechanism \nthat is available for maintaining biodiversity in general and agrobiodiversity in particular at the \nlevel. This is basically the Biodiversity Management Committees and the People‘s Biodiversity \nRegisters (PBRs). Section 2 evaluates the various laws policies that favour or hinder \nagrobiodiversity in the state. These range from the policy on biodiversity itself to the one on \nenvironment and the agricultural policy of the state to laws regarding Intellectual Property \nRights (IPRs) in general. Section 3 maps out the range of pubic or government research institutes \nwhich generate the formalised knowledge and technology for maintaining biodiversity. Section \n4, will analyse the cases of four specific local self-governments all of whom are acknowledged \nby either the State Biodiversity Board or the National Biodiversity Authority, formally, as \n                                                                 \n7See Kerala State Planning Board (2017), pp. 24-5 \n \n 9 \n \n \n \nsuccessful models from the point of view of  managing and maintaining agrobiodiversity. An \nunderstanding of the specific strategies employed by these units will be helpful for other \npanchayats in their quest towards management of their agrobiodiversity. Section 5 identifies a \nnumber of potential areas for further research. Finally, Section 6 concludes the study. 1.Main institutional mechanism for managing agrobiodiversity- \nBiodiversity Management Committees and People’s Biodiversity Registers \n \nOne of the most important components of the  state‘s biodiversity strategy is the preparation of \nPeople‘s Biodiversity Registers (PBRs). Such local-level registers of information about varieties \nareseen as an instrument to protect agrobiodiversity globally (Smale et al., 2004). Although in \nKerala tribal communities have their own institutional arrangements for managing \nagrobiodiversity (Padmanabhan, M, 2011). Her study documented collective efforts to halt \ngenetic erosion in the state by looking at four case studies on institutional innovations in \nagrobiodiversity management and analyzing their performance from the perspective of gender \nequity. Negotiation over gendered rules is at the centre of this analysis. However, her study was \nconducted during the mid-2000s when BMCs and PBRs were yet to take shape. PBRs document local community knowledge of status, uses, history, ongoing changes and forces \ndriving changes in biodiversity resources, gainers and losers in these processes and people's \nperceptions of how these resources should be managed. A number of PBRs have been prepared \nin different parts of India beginning 1995 through initiatives of NGOs and educational \ninstitutions working with local communities and village councils. These attempts have been \nmotivated by a desire to promote decentralised systems of management of natural resources and \nto create the basis for equitable sharing of benefits of commercial utilisation of local \ncommunityknowledge of uses of biodiversity. Kerala has one of the best records with respect to \npreparation of PBRs as about 85 per cent of the BMCs have prepared PBRs. See Table 1. According to the Kerala State Biodiversity Board (KSSB), all the LSGs having BMCs are \nrequired to prepare the PBRs. As per G.O.(Rt.) 2945/2013/LSGD dated 30.11.2013, the State \nGovernment has accorded sanction to incur an expenditure of Rs.1.25 lakhs for grama \npanchayats, Rs. 2.5 lakhs for municipalities and Rs.5 lakhs for corporations from the general \nsector development fund of the annual plan or own general-purpose fund for PBR preparation. It \nis mandatory, and all LSGs having BMCs are required to utilise this fund and complete the PBR \npreparation before 31.3.2017. Nevertheless, according to the KSSB (as on July 11, 2019)60 local self-governments are yet to \nprepare PBRs. The maximum numbers of panchayats not having prepared PBRs so far are in the \ndistricts of Palghat with 25 and Malappuram with 14, followed with Trichur 9, Kannur 9, \nKozhikode, Kottayam and Trivandrum with 1 each.All the other 7 districts have all their local \nself-governments preparing their respective PBRs. This means that Kerala now (July 11, 2019)  \nhas the highest PBR rate at 94.19 per cent. The BD Act stipulates that ―the main function of the BMC is to prepare People's Biodiversity \nRegister in consultation with local people. The PBR shall contain comprehensive information on \navailability and knowledge of local biological resources, their medicinal or any other use or any \nother traditional knowledge associated with them.‖ Although Kerala‘s LSGs have a good record \nin forming BMCs and preparing PBRs, it remains to be seen if the PBRs are properly framed and \nthe data contained inPBRs are subjected to an annual review to see if the biodiversity that exists \nin an LSG is maintained. 10 \n \n \n \n \nTable 1: PBR rate across states in India (as on 18/02/2019) \n \n \nBMCs \nPBRs \nPBR Rate \n(%) \nAndhra Pradesh  \n6031 \n100 \n1.66 \nArunachal Pradesh \n139 \n43 \n30.94 \nAssam \n229 \n92 \n40.17 \nBihar \nNil \nNil \n0.00 \nChhattisgarh \n223 \nNil  \n0.00 \nGoa \n191 \nNil  \n0.00 \nGujarat \n7661 \n1126 \n14.70 \nHaryana \nNil  \nNil  \n0.00 \nHimachal Pradesh \n609 \n6 \n0.99 \nJharkhand \n3384 \n14 \n0.41 \nJammu & Kashmir \nNil  \nNil \n0.00 \nKarnataka \n6228 \n1777 \n28.53 \nKerala** \n1034 \n974 \n94.19 \nMadhya Pradesh \n23431 \n890 \n3.80 \nMaharashtra \n23772 \n100 \n0.42 \nManipur \n95 \n22 \n23.16 \nMeghalaya \n263 \n30 \n11.41 \nMizoram \n250 \n5 \n2.00 \nNagaland \n110 \nNil  \n0.00 \nOdisha \n1700 \n87 \n5.12 \nRajasthan \n74 \nNil  \n0.00 \nPunjab \n113 \n11 \n9.73 \nSikkim \n35 \n4 \n11.43 \nTamil Nadu \n385 \nNil  \n0.00 \nTelangana \n3200 \n220 \n6.88 \nTripura \n502 \n431 \n85.86 \nUttarakhand \n948 \n124 \n13.08 \nUttar Pradesh \n58782 \n325 \n0.55 \nWest Bengal \n433 \n150 \n34.64 \nTotal \n139831 \n6449 \n4.61 \n Note: ** as on July 11, 2019 \nSource: National Biodiversity Authority,http://nbaindia.org/content/20/35/1/bmc.html \nhttp://nbaindia.org/content/105/30/1/pbr.html (accessed on July 18 2019)  \n \nIt is for this reason, we have taken the case of Kerala for an in-depth examination of the role of \ngovernment with respect to the promotion and maintenance of agrobiodiversity in the country. In this study, we are primarily concerned with evaluating the policies favouring agrobiodiversity \nin Kerala and then making an objective assessment of the degree to which Kerala is biodiverse in \nterms of its agriculture. 11 \n \n \n \n \n2. Evaluation of policies and laws that have an impact on agrobiodiversity \nThe state has put in place an elaborate network of rules, policies and laws impacting on the \nmanagement of agrobiodiversity. We have divided them into three groups depending on whether \nthey impact on agrobiodiversity in a direct or indirect manner and whether they contribute or \naffect knowledge generation in these are. First, we list them, and subsequently, we evaluate their \neffectiveness or not in maintaining agrobiodiversity in the state. a. Those dealing directly with agrobiodiversity:  \n• \nKerala State Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plan which has several action \npoints related to conservation of Agrobiodiversity \n• \nKerala Conservation of Paddy land and wetland Act 2008 and Amendments \n2018- which had a major impact on paddy land conversion and loss of aquatic \nbiodiversity \n• \nKerala Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Act 2010 which has a direct bearing \non Agrobiodiversity especially in the view of release of exotic species from \nAquaculture farms, Nurseries and the leaching of chemicals as antibiotics \nused in farms \n• \nKerala State Breeding Policy 2008 which does not promote traditional breeds \nand therefore affects conservation in a negative manner \n• \nEnvironment white paper 2018 which has also pointed out the impact of \npaddy land conversion on food security. • \nKerala State Organic Farming Policy, Strategy and Action Plan, 2007 \n• \nAgricultural Development Policy, 2015 \n• \nJaivam 2017 \n \nb. Those dealing with agrobiodiversity in an indirect manner \n• \nKerala State Environment Policy, 2009  \n• \n \nc. Knowledge related issues which havea bearing on agrobiodiversity:  \n• \nIntellectual Property Rights Policy for Kerala, 2008 \n• \nProtection of Plant  Varieties and  Farmers‘ Rights (PPV&FR) Act, 2001 \n• \n State experience with the Geographic Indications (GIs)of Goods Act, 1999 \n• \nKerala‘s Traditional Knowledge Protection Bill, 2016 \n• \nState position on national laws, such as the proposed Seeds Bill \n \n2.1 Kerala State Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan \nThis is the framework policy for promoting agrobiodiversity in the state. There are three specific \nstrategies that deal with agrobiodiversity management. See Table 2. Table 2: Biodiversity Strategy and Action Pan and its relationship with National \nBiodiversity Authority Targets \nStrategy \nDescription  \nLink to NBA targets  \n19 \nDevelop a database of agrobiodiversity and \ndomesticated biodiversity  \nTarget 5 \n20 \nPromote conservation of indigenous varieties and \ntheir commercial production  \n \nTarget 5 \n21 \nPrevent contamination of natural biodiversity of the \nTarget 5 \n \n 12 \n \n \n \nstate from Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)  \nSource: Own compilation  \n \nWe see that the three strategies deal with only one of the ten targets that are envisaged. In fact \nour discussions with experts reveal that of the three strategies only no. 20 seems to have been \nimplemented. Of course, the PBRs can act as a database provided they are digitised and is \navailable online. Since GMOs have not been authorised to be released in any of the agricultural \ncrops excepting cotton which incidentally is not cultivated in Kerala8, no: 21 is yet to be relevant \nfor Kerala. 2.2The Kerala State EnvironmentPolicy, 2009 \nThe environment policy has many provisions to maintain biodiversity ingeneral and \nagrobiodiversity in particular.Section 11 has 17 suchprovisions. The most important of these is \nthe formation,collection and record of local agrobiodiversity data in People‘s Biodiversity \nRegisters (PBR) at the panchayat level and the discouraging of monocultures in cropping?. According to the data from the Biodiversity Board, only 7 districts out of 14 have completed the \nformation of PBRs in all the Panchayats within a district. Further, the following comments could also be made: \n Though there are a number of strategies and action plans envisaged inKerala State \nEnvironment Policy and also by the KSBB, the details on financial allocations for these \nactions and how theseare being implemented are not clear. Hence, some of these \nstrategies andaction plans may be remaining as mere wish statements.  There is a need to strategize the protection of biodiversity.How?  Given the broad climatic characteristics of the state, the same plant species or variety \nmay be prevalent in multiple locations. Some ofthese may be useful to individuals and \nhouseholds, and hence they mayhave the incentive to conserve it.  However, private incentives may not be that high to conserve all kinds ofplants, species \nand genetic diversity (and that is the need for publicintervention in the form of the \nprovision of subsidies or regulations).  There is a resource-cost in both the provision of subsidies and also regulation. It is not \nclear whether such costs are estimated, and whether provisions are made to allocate \npublic resources for this purpose.   The attempt seems to be a wishful effort to protect agro-biodiversity in all places \nwherever these are available. This may not be a realistic target.   If the enforcement effort of the state is going to be targeted to all such localities, then it \nmay get diluted, and there could be land-use changes that may destroy biodiversity in \nmany localities.  It may be noted that agrobiodiversity prevails mostly in private lands, and the reach of \nthe state is limited in such lands compared to forests which are owned by the \ngovernment. Hence it may be desirable to have a prioritization of the agrobiodiversity to \nbe protected. 2.3The Organic Farming Policy \nThe stated purpose of this State policy is ‗to protect its rich biodiversity and thus sustain various \nlivelihoods dependent on this precious resource‘. In that sense, the connection between the \n                                                                 \n8Cotton is grown in a small area in Attappadi  in Palghat district. 13 \n \n \n \nprotection of agrobiodiversity and organic farming is envisaged before the formulation of this \npolicy. The policy was proposed and initiated by the KSBB.  Though the preamble of the policy is written in a severely non-rigorous manner, it has \ncertain positive implications for the protection of agrobiodiversity in Kerala.  The policy notes the reality that the intensity of inorganic agriculture in Kerala is not that \nhigh, and hence has the potential to move towards organic farming. Further, the policy \nnotes `the positive side of agriculture in Kerala in terms of the already low levels of \nconsumption of hazardous chemicals and, therefore, chances of redeeming farmers to \norganic agriculture are quite high‘ (p.5). The fact that farmers in Kerala use less \npesticides and other chemicals in growing crops make them much more amenable for \nshifting to organic farming than farmers elsewhere.  In the policy, a farmer is defined as 'Organic Farmer' `provided he/she adheres to and \npractices the following three essentialities of organic farming: (1) a farmer who practices \nmixed farming including food crops; (2) a farmer who ensures the conservation of soil \nand water; (3) a farmer who conserves the biodiversity of the farmland‘. This has \ninteresting implications such as  \no The conventional idea of avoiding chemical fertilizers and pesticides as the core-\nfocus of organic farming is given less importance here \no The definition of organic farming itself is connected to the preservation of \nagrobiodiversity.  The following strategies of organic farming policy can, in principle, help the \nconservation of agro-biodiversity \no Ensure seed sovereignty of the farmers and the State \no Strengthen soil and ensure water conservation measures (by following organic \napproaches) \no Promote a mixed farming approach for livelihood security and ecological \nsustainability \no Conserve and improve agrobiodiversity and undomesticated biodiversity \no Ensure availability of quality organic manure to the farmers \no Develop Model Sustainable Organic Farms in the State \n \n Model organic farms (to be) developed by the state as part of the organic farming policy \ncan be used for the in-situ and live conservation of agro-biodiversity in different agro-\nclimatic zones of Kerala.  On the other hand, the organic farming policy in its present form has a number of \nlimitations, and these may affect the achievement of the goal of protecting \nagrobiodiversity too.  It has not analyzed the economic incentives of the farmers to move towards \norganic farming policy \n It has not outlined the ways by which the state has to encourage farmers to move \ntowards organic farming overriding the economic incentives, if any, to continue \nwith non-organic farming.  It has not assessed the costs that the government has to bear in facilitating the \nshift towards an organic policy.  It has not outlined the administrative mechanisms beyond outlining the nature of a \nstate-level committee for the purpose. 14 \n \n \n \n There could be a case where bio-diversity enhancing farming may become economically \nadvantageous for certain farmers in Kerala. This is when we consider the opportunity \ncost of family labour, including that is needed for the supervision of farm operations. This is so since the conventional (chemical and mono-crop) agriculture may become \neconomically unviable due to the increase in the cost of labour or the opportunity cost of \nfamily labour. Hence a Low External Input and Sustainable Agriculture (LEISA) may \nbecome the default option for a set of farmers.  The organic farming policy has not analysed the existing state and central policies in \nagriculture that may work against the shift towards organic farming. These may include \nthe subsidies for fertilizers. Some of these policies cannot be changed by the state \ngovernment. Certain policies that prevail at the national level (say subsidy for fertilizers) \nmay benefit Kerala too since it has to import food grains from other states which practice \nchemical agriculture. These ambiguities may reduce the effectiveness of an organic \nfarming policy within Kerala and hence may work against the shift towards an agro-\nbiodiversity enhancing agriculture within the state.   The shift towards an organic farming policy also depends on the consumers or buyers of \nagricultural products. The analysis of this aspect and the strategies required in this \ndomain are weak in the policy. It sees farming mostly from the perspective of supply. This is problematic when we see that a major part of the consumption of agricultural \nproducts within Kerala is imported from other states. There may be a possibility of \ndeveloping an interest among Kerala consumers in organic products, but that may not be \nadequate. It may be that a part of the organic production in Kerala should be able to meet \nthe needs of national/international markets. (In fact, the integration of Kerala‘s \nagriculture with the national and global markets is much higher compared to that of other \nstates, and this has been the situation historically, and not due to the current phase of \nglobalization.) There may be a need to use national and global markets to facilitate the \nshift towards organic farming within Kerala. This may be not be facilitated by the \nrhetorical arguments for self-sufficiency and against trade given at the beginning of this \npolicy. These too may add to the ambiguities of the policy and reduce its effectiveness in \nenhancing/protecting agro-biodiversity. In the policy, a farmer is defined as 'Organic Farmer' `provided he/she adheres to and practices \nthe following three essentialities of organic farming: (1) a farmer who practices mixed farming \n(namely diverse crops)  including food crops; (2) a farmer who ensures the conservation of soil \nand water; (3) a farmer who conserves the biodiversity of the farmland‘. The conventional idea \nof avoiding chemical fertilizers and pesticides as the core-focus of organic farming is given less \nimportance here. The definition of organic farming itself is connected to the preservation of \nagrobiodiversity. However, the organic farming policy has not analysed the economic incentives of the farmers to \nmove towards organic farming policy. It has not outlined the ways by which the state has to \nencourage farmers to move towards organic farming overriding the economic incentives, if any, \nto continue with non-organic farming. It has not assessed the costs that the government has to \nbear in facilitating the shift towards an organic policy. It has not outlined the administrative \nmechanisms beyond outlining the nature of a state-level committee for the purpose. The organic farming policy has not analysed the existing state and central policies in agriculture \nthat may work against the shift towards organic farming. These may include the subsidies for \n \n 15 \n \n \n \nfertilizers. Some of these policies cannot be changed by the state government. Certain policies \nthat prevail at the national level (for example,for fertilizer subsidy) may benefit Kerala too since \nit has to import food grains from other states, which practice chemical agriculture. These \nambiguities may reduce the effectiveness of an organic farming policy within Kerala and hence \nmay work against the shift towards an agrobiodiversity enhancing agriculture within the state. The shift towards an organic farming policy also depends on the consumers or buyers of \nagricultural products. The analysis of this aspect and the strategies required in this domain are \nweak in the policy. It sees farming mostly from the perspective of supply. This is problematic \nwhen we see that a major part of the consumption of agricultural products within Kerala is \nimported from other states. There may be a possibility of developing an interest among Kerala \nconsumers in organic products, but that may not be adequate. It may be that a part of the organic \nproduction in Kerala should be able to meet the needs of national/international markets. (In fact, \nthe integration of Kerala‘s agriculture with the national and global markets is much higher \ncompared to that of other states, and this has been the situation historically, and not due to the \ncurrent phase of globalization.) There may be a need to use national and global markets to \nfacilitate the shift towards organic farming within Kerala. How have India‘s free trade \nagreements (FTAs), such as the ASEAN-India FTA impacted agricultural priorities and \nagrobiodiversity in the state? This may be not be facilitated by the rhetorical arguments for self-sufficiency and against trade \ngiven atthe beginning of this policy. These too may add to the ambiguities of the policy and \nreduce its effectiveness in enhancing/protecting agrobiodiversity. Any risk of organic \nmonocultures, as against diversity in organic practices. However, the actual implementation of the organic farming policy underwent considerable \nadministrative delays.As experts say, ―though there was huge enthusiasm about the policy at the \npolitical level, it was languishing at  the office of the Agricultural Production Commissioner‘s \n(APCs) for  nearly two years until it was implemented as an agricultural action plan in 2010. The policy was designed in such a fashion that each district principal agriculture officers should \nidentify the blocks and each blocks are given target of  area to be cultivated. Thereafter, the \nagriculture officer of the area was given the responsibility to initiate local action plans. Though it \nwent fairly well for quite some time the regime change drastically altered the policy direction. Ultimately the financial allocations were moved from the district development blocks to \nKasaragod district in the context of endosulfan calamities 9 . The entire course of this \ndevelopment shows the dysfunctional characteristics of the state machinery, because the agency \nthat had undertaken the organic farming responsibility in Kasaragod district ended up returning \nthe fund because they failed to fulfil the targets. Interestingly, the government seem to be \ninterested in entrusting organic farming responsibility to private agencies rather than to state \nagencies, which are comparatively efficient, well-organised and regularly monitored. The \ncurrent regime aims to involve agricultural university in the entire policy implementation. In \nshort, the only time period the policy was implemented in the last ten years is merely nineteen \nmonths‖.10 Expert views reveals the crucial fact that contrary to its flamboyance, such policies \nare  always connected to the vigor and interest of the incumbent as well as successive regimes  \n                                                                 \n9Kasaragod district in Kerala shot into global attention in the late nineties  due to use of endosulfan—a  highly toxic \npesticide—in cashew nut plantations. The toxicity of endosulfan and health issues due to its  bioaccumulation came \nunder media public and government attention when health issues precipitated in the district. 10 Interview with Mr. C Jayakumar, Director, Thanal, NGO, who actively involved in the formulation of the organic \nfarming policy of the Kerala state government. 16 \n \n \n \nand it is essential to have a permanent state agency initiate and implement and monitor  the \npolicy. As far as considering the certified organic farming area in Kerala, an organic farmers‘ directory \nhas been prepared by the Farm Information Bureau of department of agriculture and farmers‘ \nwelfare, government of Kerala. The data contains the details of farmers with their contact details \netc. for five districts of the state viz., Wayanad, Kottayam,  Malappuram  Kozhikode, and \nIdukki. See Figure 1. As per this data the area under certified organic farming comes works out \nto only 0.18 per cent of the net sown area. Figure 1: Distribution of certified organic farming area in Kerala \nSource: State Information Bureau (undated), Organic Farmer‘s Directory, Government of \nKerala,https://www.fibkerala.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=609&Itemid=88&li\nmit=1&limitstart=1) (accessed on August 21, 2019)  \nAlthough the policy on organic farming has defined an organic farmer, hitherto the state has not \nevolved any specific indicators or Standard Operating Procedures for organic and aquaculture \nfarms. These needs to be evolved so that objective definition of an organic farmer and the area \nunder organic farming can be computed and its diffusion in state‘s agriculture can easily be \nmeasured. Jaivam, Mahatma Gandhi University(MGU)’s organic farm drive:This drive is for \ntransforming one of the 14 districts, namely Kottayam district, into a 100 percent literate district \nin organic farming in cooperation with National Service Scheme, Kerala JaivaKarshakaSamiti, \nacademic departments of the university and Kudumbasree units. The main aim of the project is \nto inform each family member of the district about organic farming. As part of this, the trained \nvolunteers would visit 4,87,296 households in 71 panchayats and 6 municipalities in the district. The volunteers would interact with the 1.97 million people in the district to adopt ethical organic \npractices to enrich the soil and preserve the environment for a healthy generation. It was \ninaugurated on August 29, 2017. The project is implemented through the National Service \nScheme (NSS) units in its affiliated colleges.However there is practically no data on how far this \nspecific project has contributed to managing agrobiodiversity in the state. In any case, data from \nthe Farm Information (undated) shows that the total area under certified organic farms in \nKottayam district is only about 37 hectares- working out to an insignificant percentage of area \nunder organic cultivation in the state. 13.49\n0.99\n6.75\n4.05\n74.73\nWayanad\nKottayam\nMalappuram\nKozhikode\nIdukki\n \n 17 \n \n \n \n2.4Agricultural Development Policy \nAnother policy having a bearing on agrobiodiversity is the Agricultural Development Policy \n2015 of the state. The policy has 46 sub-policies. Although none of these is specificto \nbiodiversity despite the fact that one of the much-asserted objectives of the policy is to make \n―Kerala a biodiversity paradise‖. However,the CDSteam has identified 10 sub-policies that have \nthe potential to either support agrobiodiversity or have a negative impact on it. Of the 19, 9 have \na positive impact, and 1 may have a negative impact. The suggested policies in Agricultural Development Policy, 2015, which may have an impact on \nthe protection of agrobiodiversity, are listed in Table 3.

It is mentioned in only one place. (Policy 245: Kerala is \nhaving a well-defined policy on 'Organic Farming', and on this light, organic pesticides are to be \nmade freely available, and the recent technology developed by CTCRI needs an intensified \nproduction.) The focus of the latter seems to be on the mainstream input-intensive agriculture. This shows how different policies can be at cross-purposeswith respect to mainstreaming \nagrobiodiversity. Most of the policy statements in Kerala Agricultural Development Policy, 2015, are wish \nstatements, without thinking about the costs and mechanisms for their enforcement. 2.5. Laws on Intellectual Property Rights \nAnother policy having a bearing on agrobiodiversity is the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) \nPolicy of the state. This policy is formulated in consonance with the provisions of the Indian \nPatents Act and the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. However, the focus is on what it calls \n`traditional knowledge‘. The main purpose of the policy is to create legal property rights on such \nknowledge to avoid `misappropriation‘ by corporate and capitalist enterprises and can lead to the \ncreation of a knowledge commons. We need to think theoretically about the potential of such a \n`legal right‘ on traditional knowledge on the conservation of agrobiodiversity. It may be better to \ncompare a `with‘ and `without‘ situation here. We may consider a legal right to the farmer useful \nfor the protection of agrobiodiversity, if there is an actual or probable under-use of traditional \nknowledge, and a decline in the use of the diverse variety of genetic, plants and animal varieties, \nand hence there is a decline in the effort to conserve/protect these varieties, in the absence of the \nlegal right, and if the newly instituted right can reverse the trend. We need to evaluate the \n`Intellectual Property Rights Policy of Kerala‘ with such a perspective. Tables 4 and 5 \nsummarises the grant of two IPR laws, namelygeographical indications (GIs) granted and Plant \nVarietyProtection (PVP) registered in Kerala since 2005. Based on this perspective, CDS sees only one clause (No.6) directly contributing to the \nconservation of agrobiodiversity. This is the one which entrusts with the Kerala Traditional \nKnowledge Authority(KTKA) with the responsibility to carry out promotional activities such as \nthe formation of `traditional knowledge cooperatives in order to enable such users to access \nlarger markets for their practices and products‘. The policy also gives a strong role to the SBB. Such access to larger markets may enhance the incentives to use traditional knowledge and \nhence preserve agro-biodiversity (as long as it is required for the use of such knowledge). 20 \n \n \n \n \nTable 4: Geographical Indications granted to agricultural products from Kerala \n \nSl.No \nGeographical Indications \nGoods \nFrom April 2004 – March 2005 \n1 \nAranmulaKannadi \nHandicraft  \nFrom April 2005- March 2006 \n \nNIL \n \nFrom April 2006-March 2007 \n \nNIL \n \nFrom April 2007- March 2008 \n2 \nAlleppey Coir \nHandicraft \n3 \nNavara Rice \nAgricultural \n4 \nPalakkadanMatta Rice \nAgricultural \n5 \nMalabar Pepper \nAgricultural \n6 \nSpices – Alleppey Green \nCardamom \nAgricultural \nFrom April 2008- March 2009 \n7 \nMaddalam of Palakkad \nHandicraft \n8 \nScrew Pine Craft of Kerala \nHandicraft \n9 \nBrass Broidered Coconut Shell \nCrafts of Kerala \nHandicraft \n10 \nPokkali Rice \nAgricultural \nFrom April 2009- March 2010 \n11 \nVazhakulam Pineapple \nAgricultural \n12 \nCannanore Home Furnishings \nHandicraft \n13 \nBalaramapuramSarees and Fine \nCotton Fabrics \nHandicraft \nFrom April 2010 March 2011 \n14 \nKasaragod Sarees \nHandicraft \n15 \nKuthampully Sarees \nHandicraft \n16 \nCentral Travancore Jaggery \nAgricultural \n17 \nWayanad Jeerakasala Rice \nAgricultural \n18 \nWayanad Gandhakasala Rice \nAgricultural \n19 \nPayyannur Pavithra Ring \nHandicraft \nFrom April 2011- March 2012 \n20 \nChendamangalamDhoties& \nSetMundu \nHandicraft \nFrom April 2012 March 2013 \n \nNIL \n \nFrom April 2013- March 2014 \n21 \nKaipad Rice \nAgricultural \nFrom April 2014- March 2015 \n22 \nChengalikodanNendran Banana \n \nAgricultural \nFrom April 2015- March 2016 \n23 \nKuthampallyDhoties& Set Mundu \nHandicraft \n24 \nMaddalam of Palakkad (Logo) \nHandicraft \n25 \nBrass Broidered Coconut Shell \nHandicraft \n \n 21 \n \n \n \nCraft of Kerala (Logo)  \n26 \nScrew Pine Craft of Kerala (Logo) \n \nFrom April 2016- March 2017 \n \nNIL \n \nFrom April 2017- March 2018 \n27 \nNilambur Teak \nAgricultural \nSource: Patent Information Centre, Kerala State Council for Science, \nTechnology and Environment \n \n \nTable  5: Plant Varieties Registered from Kerala \nChennellu \nReg.

This \nis an area where future research is required. 2.6Extent of Agrobiodiversity in Kerala \nIt is essential that we have a summary measure to quantify the extent of agro biodiversity and its \nchanges over time. Ideally speaking, it should be constructed at the level of the BMC. But \ndetailed data for such quantification at the BMC level is hard to come by, but the KSBB may \ndevelop it. As a first step, we compute the area of those agricultural crops that allow \nintercropping with other crops. The share of the area under such bio-diverse crops in the total \ncropped area is computed. It shows that about 77per cent of the cropped area in the states is \nunder bio-diverse crops in 2016-17,although it has shown some slight reduction in 2016-17 \ncompared to 2007-08 (Figure 2). This is essentially due to the fact that – Natural Rubber- one of \nthe primary commodities and the main mono-crops in the state has increased its share of cropped \narea (Figure 3), although all other monocrops have reduced their area. However, Natural Rubber \ncontinues to occupy an important position in the cropping pattern of the state (Figure 4). Figure 2: Trends in Agrobiodiversity Index, 2007-08 and 2016-17 \nSource: Based on data contained in Economic Review, Kerala State Planning Board (various \nissues)  \n79.3\n76.89\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n2007-08\n2016-17\n \n 23 \n \n \n \nFigure 3: Changes in area under monocrops during 2007-08 and 2016-17 \nSource: Based on data contained in Economic Review, Kerala State Planning Board (various \nissues)  \nFigure 4: Cropping pattern of the state (as on March 31, 2018)  \nSource: Based on data contained in Economic Review, Kerala State Planning Board (various \nissues)  \nHowever considerable gaps exist in our knowledge of genetic diversity of crops. The annual data \non agricultural area and output brought by the State‘s Department of agriculture does not reveal \nagrobioversity. Hence we recommend that the agricultural statistics may include varietal \ndiversity of at least the major agricultural crops to enable better conservation of \nAgrobiodiversity. 2.7 Some critical issues having a bearing on management of agrobiodiversity \nHere we discuss two specific issues that have a bearing on management of agrobiodiversity in \nKerala. These are the role of custodian farmers and Access Benefit Sharing. These are discussed \nin some detail below:  \n \n7.08\n-72.10\n-19.87\n-19.62\n-39.99\n-4.15\n-80.00\n-70.00\n-60.00\n-50.00\n-40.00\n-30.00\n-20.00\n-10.00\n0.00\n10.00\n20.00\nRubber\nGinger(Dry)\nTurmeric\nTea\nPineapple\nTotal \nmonocrops \nCoconut**\n37%\nRubber#\n27%\nRice\n9%\nAreca Nut\n5%\nPepper\n4%\nCoffee***\n4%\nTapioc\n3%\nBanana\n3%\nOther Platains\n3%\nCashew nut\n2%\nCardamom*\n2%\nTea $\n1%\nGinger\n0%\nTurmeric\n0%\nPulses \nincluding Tur\n0%\n \n 24 \n \n \n \n2.7.1 Role of custodian farmers \nBiodiversity international, a CGIAR research Centre defines custodian farmers as ―Custodian \nfarmers are defined as ―those farmers (men and women) who actively maintain, adapt and \ndisseminate agricultural biodiversity and related knowledge, over time and space, at farm and \ncommunity levels and are recognized by community members for it‖. Given the fact that \nexisting gene banks and other ex-situ conservation measures are not sufficient enough to \nconserve agrobiodiversity, it is recommended that custodian farmers should be the main focus of \nagrobiodiversity conservation as they are functioning as a farmer-cultivators as well as farmer-\nconserver. So the policy on agrobiodoversity management must include identification, support \nand promotion of custodian farmers. Examples of custodian farmers include, Chruvayal Raman \nor Ramettan-a Kurichiya tribe farmer by birth, is leading a battle to preserve age-old traditions of \ncultivation that were prevalent among the Adivasis of Wayanad. N. M. Shaji, who is conserving \na wide spectrum of tuber crops, including wild tubers, paddy, and vegetables using organic \ncultivation methods, is another notable custodian farmer: he had also won the national Plant \nGenome Saviour Award in 2015. 2.7.2Access Benefit Sharing \nThe Nagoya protocol on Biodiversityemphasizes the access to the genetic resources and its fair \nand equitable benefit sharing of genetic resources. This is known as Access Benefit Sharing \n(ABS). As per Section 7 of Biodiversity Act 2002 and Section 16 of Kerala Biological Diversity \nRule, 2008, any Indian citizen or body corporate or association or registered organization should \nseek approval of the KSBB for access to collection of biological resources in Kerala for \ncommercial utilization. The transition to an ABS regime is a priority area identified by the State \nPlanning Board, in its working group report on biodiversity for the 13th Five Year Plan (Kerala \nState Planning Board, 2017). Chapter 9 of the working group report deals with ABS. It proposes \na statewide scheme for documenting commercially tradablebio resources and industries utilising \nthe resources. The report calls for equipping panchayat-level Biodiversity Management \nCommittees (BMCs) with negotiating skills to maximise the returns from trade in bioresources \nunder the ABS regime. The BMC would be authorised to levy collection fee for accessing \nbiological resources for commercial purposes. The levy would be deposited in a local \nbiodiversity fund and utilised for conservation activities. According to press reports11, the \nKSBB had identified 2,694 industrial units including Ayurvedic drug companies, tea and coffee \nmanufacturers, agro-based units, food and fruit processing centres, leather, cashew, textiles, \npaper, rubber, coir, spices, wood and bamboo-based industries and exporters of these products \nthat were liable to pay a part of their sales revenue for access to bioresources and associated \ntraditional knowlededge into a fund to be denoted as Local Biodiversity Fund. We could not find \nout whether fund has actually been created and whether the rules for operationalising the fund \nhave been created. This is one of the policy instruments for agrobiodiversity management that \nneeds immediate attention. 3.Public ResearchInstitutions(PRIs) that support knowledge creation \nfor agrobiodiversity \n \nKerala has a wide network of public research institutes which have been engaged in the \ngeneration of formalised knowledge for ensuring agrobiodiversity. These are owned by the \ncentral and state governments. Further, there are a limited number of NGOs which are diffusing \nknowledge on agrobiodiversity. Of these, 5 PRIs (national and state level) and 2 NGOs which \nare actively engaged in the promotion of agrobiodiversity have been selected. The CDSteam also \n                                                                 \n11See Nandakumar T (2017)  \n \n 25 \n \n \n \nselected 2 more PRIs that are active in promotion of biodiversity in general as well. The \nactivities and interventions of these institutions in these areas have also been assessed. Table 6: PRIs and NGOs selected for in-depth examination \nSl.

Kerala Forest Research Institute(KFRI),Peechi, Thrissur \nBiodiversity \n \n3.1Central Tuber Crops Research Institute (CTCRI) \nCTCRI is a national-level institute coming under Indian Council of Agricultural Research \n(ICAR) to undertake basic, strategic and applied research for generating technologies to \nenhance productivity and utilization potential of tuber crops other than potato. The key areas \nare genetic resource management, crop improvement, sustainable production and utilization of \ntropical tuber crops. It acts as a national repository of scientific information on tuber crops and \ntransferring tuber crops technology through consultancy, outreach programmes and linkage \nwith developmental agencies. The activities of CTCRI have been executed through five \ndivisions i.e., Crop Improvement, Crop Production, Crop Protection, Crop Utilisation and \nExtension and Social Sciences. The collection of germplasm of different tuber crops from \ndifferent parts of the world and conserving it in field gene bank has been carrying out under \ncrop improvement division. The development of new varieties of tuber crops with higher yield \nand other attributes suitable for industrial applications as well as for food purpose is another \nimportant activity of this division. The development of new agro techniques for tropical tuber \ncrops in different agro-climatic regions is being monitored under crop production division. The \ndevelopment of strategies and products for managing pests and diseases, which are affecting \ntropical tuber crops is being monitored under crop protection division. Crop utilization division \nconcentrates its activities on value addition and post-harvest processing of tropical tuber crops. Transferring the technologies of CTCRI to its clienteles and introducing farmers‘ supporting \nschemes come under the extension and social sciences division. Generally, tuber crops are considered asthethird most important food crop. In present global \nscenario of climate change, tuber crops are gaining visibility as Future Smart Crops for climate \nresilience, low input cost and also for being rich in calorie, dietary fibers, minerals, vitamins \nand anti-oxidants (Research Highlights-2017-18, CTCRI). CTCRI is carrying out the \ndevelopment of tuber crops to ensure nutritional food and livelihood enhancement for the rural \npeople. The Centre organizes awareness training programmes, technical assistance, an \nincubator facility for the production of value-added products from tuber crops to farmers, \n \n 26 \n \n \n \nentrepreneurs, etc., The Centre also strives to popularize various kinds of tuber cultivation \namong the farmers. New varieties of tubers of high yield and disease-resistant have been \ndeveloped. The centre is conserving 15 species of tubers including cassava, sweet potato, yam, taro etc. The centre is also maintaining related species like 13 species of Greater yam, Lesser yam, \nPotato yam, 6 species of Taro, 8 species of Elephant yam, 4 species of Chinese potato, 8 species \nof Minor arrowroot, one species of minor wild tubers and one species of Asparagus. A total of \n5570 accessions comprising 1211 cassava, 1124 sweet potato, 1110 yams, 683 edible aroids, \n200 minor tuber crops and 1242 collections from Regional Centre (RC) were maintained and \nconserved in the field gene bank of CTCRI. It is reported that new collections were added to the \nexisting germplasm from various sources in sweet potato (20), yams (3), edible aroids (1) and \nminor tuber crops (15). The centredeveloped 67 new varieties of various kinds of tubers. It includes 19 Cassava \nvarieties, 21 Sweet Potato, 9 Greater yam, 5 White yam, 2 Lesser yam, 8 Edible aroids, 2 \nElephant foot yam, and one Chinese potato varieties. Cassava varieties i.e., SreeAthulya and \nSree Apoorva with higher yield and high extractable starch have been developed in CTCRI, \nTrivandrum has been registered in ICAR-NBPGR. Sweet potato varieties, i.e., BhuSona,Bhu \nKrishna, Bhu Swami have been developed in RC, ICAR-CTCRI Bhubaneswar has also been \nregistered in ICAR-NBPGR. CTCRI developed biopesticides from cassava leaves which are popular in the state, namely \nNanma, Sreya and Menma. It is effective for preventing Pseudostem weevil attack and Rhizome \nweevil attack in banana cultivation. There is immense scope for promoting these biopesticides in \nthe state, especially since a lot of farmers are cultivating banana as compared to paddy. Organic farming network project is being carried out by the Centre. It is reported that \nstandardised organic farming practices for all major tuber crops are being promoted. Mobile app, \nnamely ‗Tuber Guru‘ has been developed for getting information related to the tropical tuber \ncrops for the public both in English and Malayalam languages. Algorithm for Variety \nIdentification Tool (VIT) app to identify varieties of tuber crops based on their morphological \nattributes like colour, shape, leaf, etc., has also been developed. On the front of the promotion of \nagro biodiversity, CTCRI plays a pivotal role in the conservation of tuber crops‘ diversity. Previously, the KSBB had proposed a tuber germplasm conservation programme in Onattukara \npanchayat in Alappuzha district. However we could not find any update on this programme. 3.2 Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (KVASU) \nKerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (KVASU) was established in 2010 by the \nGovernment of Kerala to provide education, research and extension services in the field of \nVeterinary and Animal Sciences. The university occupies 100 acres of land at Pookode in \nWayanad district, which was allotted from the land belonging to the Pookode Dairy Tribal \nWelfare Project of Government of Kerala. The University comprises of three major areas: \nVeterinary and animal sciences, Dairy Science and Poultry Science. The 8 constituent colleges \nfunctioning under the university are College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences located at \nMannuthy and Pookodu,  College of Dairy Science and Technology located at  Mannuthy, \nPookode, Chettachal, Kolahalamedu, College of Avian Sciences and Management \nThiruvazhamkunnu, College of Food Technology, Thumburmuzhy, etc. The University has a \nwide network of instructional and research farms spread throughout the state. 27 \n \n \n \nVarious institutions under the university contribute to research and extension services in the \nfields of veterinary, dairy, poultry, etc. The Directorate of Entrepreneurship with headquarters at \nPookode, Wayanad focuses on capacity building of farmers, entrepreneurs and extend services \nthrough outreach programmes, developing model farms, supporting self-help groups in \nimproving production and productivity of livestock. The Directorate plays a vital role in \ncommercializing new ideas and raising productivity and employment in all sectors, especially \nbenefitting the farming community. The College of Dairy Science and Technology, is focussing \non the value addition of milk, establishment and commissioning of dairy plants throughout the \nstate, assuring safe and quality products for the public, designing kits and tests for quality \nanalysis of milk and milk products, maintaining active link between the field level farmers and \nscientific community, in-depth knowledge of farm animal practices etc. Centre for Advanced \nStudies in Poultry Science which is located at Mannuthy mainly focuses on academic and \nresearch on poultry science. It also conducts training programmes for farmers, conserving \npoultry germplasm, selection and breeding of egg production, etc. Wayanad district is rich in forests and wildlife. The human-wildlife conflict is a serious issue \nwhile considering agricultural practice in high ranges. Farmers are suffering from attacks of wild \nanimals as it damages crops and other consequences. Centre for Wildlife Studies of the \nuniversity is focusing on carrying out research in the areas of forest and biodiversity of the \nWestern Ghats region, human-wildlife conflicts etc. To conduct research on climate change \nadaptation and mitigation strategies in the field of Animal Agriculture, a Centre for Animal \nAdaptation to Environment and Climate Change Studies has been established. 3.2.1 Conservation of Indigenous Animals \nVechur Cow  \nVechur Cattle Conservation Project is running under the KVASU for increasing the reproduction \nand conservation of indigenous cattle. Vechur cattle are indigenous, disease resistant and \nsuitable for Kerala's climate. The average height for Vechur cows is three feet only, and the cost \nof feeding and rearing is less compared to the hybrids. Milk production may not be as high as \nhybrids, but the quality of Vechur milk is very high. A large Vechur farm under KVASU \ncomprising 120 cows is functioning in Mannuthy by applying scientific reproductive methods. Other Vechur farms are functioning in Thiruvazhamkunnu, Thumburmuzhy and Pookode. There \nis a huge demand for Vechur cow from the farmers. KVASU is supplying cattle based on \npriority only, and it is unable to meet the increased demand from farmers. Semen of Vechur \nbulls has been collected and protected as chilled semen through scientific methods for supplying \nto the farmers. It is reported that the regular supply of chilled semen to the already sold cows, \ntheir progeny and other registered cows are continuing from the project. 28 \n \n \n \n \nVechur Cows \nSource: http://vechur.org/ \n \nThe cattle conservation project is also aiming at the conservation of Kasaragode dwarf, which is \nanother indigenous variety. Conservation, scientific reproduction methods, and meeting \ndemandsoffarmers for Kasaragod dwarf cattle are being encouraged. The project also aims to \nmake people aware about the genetic diversity of indigenous cattle and to extend the low-cost \nlivestock rearing to the rural areas. In addition to the role of KVASU, the Vechur Conservation Trust has played an important role \nin conserving the indigenous animals. One of the main difficulties in diffusing indigenous cows \nlike the Vechur cow is the dairy policy of the state which lay emphasis on hybridsation of cows \nto improve milk yield. Pigs, Goats and other Animals \nKVASU is conserving indigenous Angamali pigs and maintaining farms. Centre for Pig \nProduction and Research under KVASU is functioning at Mannuthy. A pig breeding farm has \nalso been maintaining there. The major objective of the centre is to, conduct research on \ndifferent aspects of pig production, to operate as an instructional farm to students, to function as \na demonstration unit to farmers, to maintain purebred nuclear stock of animals for the supply of \nquality piglets to farmers. A new crossbred pig, namely ‗Mannuthy White‘ has been developed \nand released on 8thFebruary 2017. The centre is functioning with the objective to study the \nperformance of indigenous pigs and their crosses with Large White Yorkshire for the efficiency \nof feed conversion, production and reproduction. The Centre for Pig Production and Research \nMannuthy has been providing purebred and crossbred piglets to farmers for starting breeding \nunits all over Kerala and many parts of south India. The centre provides training, technical \nadvice and support to establish pig farms, etc. to the farmers. A Goat and Sheep Farm is functioning at Mannuthy. Supply of kids to farmers, technical and \nmanagerial advice to farmers about goat farming, breeding, etc. have been going on. Conservation of indigenous ‗Malabari Goat‘in its native tract, supply of superior breeding bucks \nto the field centres for breeding purpose are in progress under the Goat Improvement Scheme. KVASU has identified farmers for indigenous goat rearing and provides all support to them. A \nRabbit farm is also maintained, with a supply of rabbits, to provide technical advice to the needy \nfarmers. Poultry \n \n 29 \n \n \n \nA Poultry farm consisting of 34 varieties is being systematically maintained under the university. Varieties of indigenous and other egg fowls which include Gramasree, GramaLekshmi, Athulya, \nDesicross, Giriraja, Australorp, Rhode Island Red, New Hampshire,Thellichery, Aseel, \nKuttanadu duck, Kadaknath etc., are conserved in the farm. Other poultries including ducks, \nquails, ornamental poultries, etc., are alsoconservedin the farm. Schemes like Aiswarya have \nbeen introduced to propagate poultry to increase egg production in the state. Gothra Mission  \nBeing the largest institute for higher education in Wayanad and the only university of the \ndistrict, KVASU has taken a responsibility to participate in the efforts of the Government of \nKerala to work for the upliftment of tribal people. A new project, namely ‗Gothra Mission‘ has \nbeen introduced in this respect. Gothra Mission was formally inaugurated by the Hon. Governor \nof Kerala on 6th April, 2019. Today, tribes lead a marginalized life, far from the freedom they \nonce enjoyed in nature, forced to live in restricted spaces under extreme poverty and \nexploitation, having to depend on settlers for subsistence mostly as agricultural labourers. Poor \neducation and alcoholism are serious concerns among them. It is reported that KVASU having 100 acres of land, a large number of students and teaching \nfaculty with expertise in all areas associated with animal husbandry and allied areas, including \ncourses, training programmes and infrastructure suitable for training tribal youth for alternate \nlivelihood activities, are the advantages in tribal welfare work. Salient features of Gothra Mission \nPresently ninetribal students belonging to the Paniya community who are most vulnerable \namong tribes, are being trained for six months under the KVASU certificate course titled \n‗Multiskill Development Programme in Integrated Resource Management Centred on Livestock \nand Poultry‘. All of the students are dropouts from school; none has completed SSLC, working \nas daily wage labourers. Most of them come from landless families of Narangakandy Tribal \nColony, Kalpeta. KVASU provides a stipend of Rs. 500.00 per day for 5 days a week during the \nsix months course from the Scheduled Tribes Development Department (Integrated Tribal \nDevelopment Project, Kalpeta) for each student. Training in vegetable cultivation, poultry \nfarming, rabbit rearing, ornamental fish rearing, aquarium and pond making, poultry keeping, \nbeekeeping, mushroom cultivation, animal cage industrial fabrication, orchid and anthurium \ncultivation, dog keeping for breeding, ornamental bird breeding, etc. have been provided. Production units of each of these activities have been established in 2 acres of land at the \nuniversity campus. Display units of ‗I farm‘, is a novel method introduced by KVASU Centre for Wildlife Studies, \nestablished under the Gothra Mission. These units allow the integrated rearing of poultry, \nvegetables, fish, etc., in human-wildlife conflict areas. It is reported that these units are being \nmanaged by the tribal students and they are also trained in the manufacture of ―I farm‖ units. Students are being supported to continue school education under ‗Thulyatha‘ scheme. Now the \nstudents started earning money already from the sale of chicken eggs, vegetables, etc., at the \nuniversity campus. The tribal students are being organized into a co-operative that will function \nunder the continuous guidance of the university, and other tribal people will also be included. Produces, value-added products and services of the co-operative will be made available to the \npublic through the facilities of the university, including its sales counters. It is reported that \nlandless tribal members can undertake income-generating activities at the unused parts of the \nuniversity campus. Members who own land can undertake income-generating activities under \n \n 30 \n \n \n \nthe continuous guidance of the university. Ninety-five percent of the income from sales will be \ndivided among the members of the co-operative that participate in the activities, 5% of income \nwill be transferred to university for the sustainability of the project. A start-up company is being registered with the Technology Business Incubation Centre (TBIC) \nof the university by a fraternity of the alumni of various graduate and postgraduate courses of the \nuniversity under the leadership of alumni of the Master of Science (Wildlife Studies), course \nbeing run under the KVASU Centre for Wildlife Studies. The company will be responsible for \npublicizing and sales of the produce, value-added products and services of the co-operative, \nincluding the ―I farm‖ units, using online and other marketing methods at a national and \ninternational level, this will allow more demand and sustainability for the income-generating \nactivities of the co-operatives. Conducting research for further development, extension activities by making a link between \nscientists and farmers, providing training to the farmers, creating model farms, knowledge \ntransfer for scientific livestock rearing etc., have been carried  out by the various institutions in \nthe fields of veterinary, dairy, poultry under the university. The university strives to extend its \nresearch outcomes to the farmers by providing training, scientific methods for livestock rearing, \nconserving traditional varieties of animals and poultry, etc. The brand name of the university is \na crucial factor among the farmers and people, and it can be utilised to disseminate its activities. The Gothra Mission initiative of KVASU is a unique attempt to uplift the tribes by providing \nlivelihood opportunities through agricultural and livestock practices. This is contributing to the \npromotion of agrobiodiversity as well. 3.3 Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) \nKerala Agricultural University (KAU) was established in 1971 with the aim of excellence in \nagricultural education, research and extension for sustainable agricultural development and \nlivelihood security of the farming community. The headquarters of KAU is located at Mannuthy, \nThrissur. The University has seven colleges, sixRegional Agricultural Research Stations \n(RARS), other Research Stations and Research and Extension Units. In addition, an Academy on \nClimate Change Adaptation and an Institute of Agricultural Technology are also functioning in \nKAU.KAU is providing quality education in agriculture, horticulture, co-operation, forestry, \nagricultural engineering, home science and other allied disciplines through its various \ninstitutions. KAU is also rendering the support to increase the productivity of crops in the \nagricultural sector by means of research initiatives. The state has been divided into six agro-ecological zones by KAU to carry out research and \nextension of various crops based on location specificity. The zones are northern, high range, \ncentral, special zone for problem areas, Onattukara and southern zone.Two research stations are \nfunctioning in the Northern Zone for coconut and pepper. Regional Agricultural Research \nStation (RARS), Pilicode maintains a unique collection of coconut germplasm consisting of 35 \nexotic and 40 indigenous types and the research on hybridisation for getting high yield are being \ncarried out. Pepper Research Station, Panniyur has released five varieties of pepper, viz. Panniyur-1, Panniyur-2, Panniyur-3, Panniyur-4 and Panniyur-5 through their research and all \nare well received by the farmers. Two research stations are functioning to provide research \nsupport for agriculture in the High Range zone (Wayanad and Idukki districts and \nNelliyampathy area of Palakkad district). RARS, Ambalavayal(Wayanadu) concentrates on rice, \nspices and vegetables and serves as a major hub for the supply of seeds and planting materials of \nvarious crops. Cardamom Research Station, Pampadumpara is a substation of RARS \n \n 31 \n \n \n \nAmbalavayal and the station is maintaining a germplasm bank of 77 cultivated and 14 wild types \nof cardamom. In central zone, nine research stations are functioning for providing research and \nextension services for rice, banana, cashew, vegetables, medicinal plants, pineapple, passion \nfruit etc. Various crop varieties including banana, cashew has been released for cultivation \nthrough these centres. There are also functioning four stations in a special zone for problem \nareas to carry out research on rice, pokkali rice etc., and to address the problems of Kuttanadu \nand Onattukara regions. In Onattukara zone one station is functioning for conducting research on \nOnattukara coconut. In southern zone four stations are functioning for various crop \nimprovement, research and extension services. 3.4 Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS) \nRegional Agricultural Research Station comes under the Kerala Agricultural University and is \nlocated at Pattambi, Palakkad district. The lead function of the station is to conduct research \nmainly on rice, pulses, horticultural crops and rice-based farming systems. The institute aims at \nsustainable food production by providing technology backup for better production and safe \nproduction practices. It also aims at rendering basic knowledge and practical experience in the \nfield to the youngsters who are interested in agriculture through its academic programmes. The \nstation was upgraded as Regional Agricultural Research Station for Central Zone comprising of \nErnakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad and Malappuram districtsunder the National Agricultural \nResearch Programme (NARP) in 1981. The first high yielding hybrid derivative variety of rice \nof South-East Asia ―Annapoorna (Ptb-35)‖ was released for cultivation by this station in 1966. RARS is concentrating on the collection and conservation of rice diversity in the state, which is \nthe most important crop of Kerala. There were three major seasons in Kerala for paddy \ncultivation i.e., Virippu (April-May to September-October),Mundakan (July-August to February-\nMarch) and Puncha (January-February to April-May). More than thousands of rice varieties, \nwhich were in cultivation during different seasons, have been collected and conserved in a well \nmaintained deep-freeze laboratory. Traditional varieties of paddy were well suited for the \ndifferent agro-climatic conditions in the state. The conservation of such varieties without losing \nits traits has been maintained in the centre. The RARS is providing traditional varieties of rice to \nfarmers who are interested in their cultivation. Such varieties can be considered as parent seeds \nfor breeding purposes for getting new traits and advantages through the research. The RARS is \nmaintaining acres of paddy land for the cultivation of rice varieties to get their new seeds for the \npurpose of conservation. Based on different rice varieties, there are different time periods. Among the traditional varieties of rice, some of them have special characteristics also. The 13 \nrice varieties which have resistance to salinity (seven types of pokkali, four types grown in the \nsaline land of Pannanikole wet land, and two types of Kaippadu land) have been identified. Ten \ndrought-resistant varieties and 12 flood-resistant varieties have also been identified. Seven types \nof scented rice varieties (like jeerakasala, gandhakasala,neycheeraetc. ), seventeen varieties with \nmedicinal value (navara, nallachennellu, rakthasali etc. ), and three types of good cooking \nquality have been characterised as special traditional varieties. The traditional rice varieties have been donors for various traits in the rice breeding programmes \nworldwide. The rice improvement efforts had been made in the station in earlier times before the \ngreen revolution and resulted in the popularisation of various rice varieties. Pattambi rice \nvarieties are internationally acclaimed for their performance and accepted as international donors \nfor biotic and a-biotic stress breeding (75 years of research, RARS, Pattambi-2002). A lot of new \nvarieties have been developed considering the high yielding possibilities and different agro-\nclimatic situations in Kerala. The varieties with disease-resistant, pest resistant, survival capacity \nof climate conditions, etc., have been developed by the station. It is reported that the yield of \n \n 32 \n \n \n \ntraditional varieties will be lower, but the traits will be higher. The farmers are interested in \ncultivating high yielding varieties because of the expectation of profitability of cultivation. Now \nthe area under paddy cultivation is going to come down due to high cost of cultivation, fear of \nloss etc. Though, some farmers who are interested in cultivation of paddy as a passion are \napproaching the station for collecting such rice varieties. Outlets of the RARS are functioning \nfor the public to distribute paddy seeds. Farmer support programmes, awareness campaigns are \nalso being conducted. Supply of rice varieties in association with agricultural departments is also \ngoing on. RARS is functioning as a promoting agency for rice cultivation under Kerala \nAgricultural University, which is fostering the rice diversity in the state. 3.5 National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR) \nNBPGR is an institute coming under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research for the \nManagement and promotion of sustainable use of plant genetic and genomic resources of agri-\nhorticultural crop and carriesout related research. The establishment of the Bureau coincided \nwith the advent of the Green Revolution and was in response to the realisation of perceived \neffects of the Green Revolution on agrobiodiversity. The NBPGR played a pivotal role in the \nimprovement of various crop plants, diversification and development of agriculture in India \nthrough germplasm introduction from various institutes located in foreign countries and also \nfrom within the country. Headquarter of NBPGR is located at New Delhi, and the regional \ncentre of Kerala is located at Thrissur. NBPGR is a major institute which exclusively functions for the conservation of agrobiodiversity. NBPGR is conserving indigenous plant genetic diversity at the national level. A gene bank for \nindigenous and exotic collections, wild crop relatives, etc., has been maintained and the details \nof it havebeen made available on the PGR database. It is the only source of plant genetic \ndiversity that imparts valuable traits needed for meeting the challenges of adapting crop \nvarieties. Considering the future needs to address changing climatic conditions or disease of \ncrops, all plant genetic diversity has its own relevance and NBPGR is keeping it in a systematic \nway. NBPGR, Thrissur is maintaining 10.4 ha. farm area for cultivating various crop varieties to \nget new seeds for the conservation purposes based on the particular time periods which depends \non the characteristics of the crop varieties. A scientific laboratory has been well maintained for \nthe conservation. Seeds are being well packed and coded and stored in the deep freeze \nlaboratory. The mandate of the centre is augmentation, characterisation, evaluation, \nmaintenance, regeneration, conservation, documentation and distribution of plant genetic \nresources in South India. Jurisdiction of this centre is Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Goa, \nUnion Territories of Puducherry, Lakshadweep and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. As per the gene bank database of NBPGR indigenous collections from Kerala is 4333 which \nincludes 1833 cereals, 972 vegetables, 204 medicinal and aromatic plants, 146 Pseudo cereals \netc. (Table-7). Out of the 1833 cereals, 1825 is rice varieties, and the rest is maize and wheat. Table 7:NBPGR- Indigenous Collections from Kerala \nSl.No \nCrop Group \nNumber of \nAccessions \n1.

As far as germplasm conservation is concerned a total of \n8306 accessions comprising 74 crops and their wild relatives and other economic plants are \nmaintained (in field gene bank and medium-term storage), and 18680 accessions were sent to \nNational Gene Bank for long term storage (as per the documents of NBPGR). Germplasm \ncollections of different perennial horticultural crops have been transferred to various crop-based \ninstitutions like CTCRI Trivandrum, IISR Kozhikode etc. Also, it has been supplied to the \nvarious user agencies, government institutes under Material Transfer Agreement (MTA). It is reported that Kerala Agricultural University has released seven varieties using germplasm of \nNBPGR. The released varieties are Brinjal-Neelima(having high yield potential and disease \nresistant), Chinese Potato-Nidhi (having high yield, large tubers, good cooking quality and \nsuitable as a short duration vegetable crop in Kerala), Greater Yam-Indu, Okra-Salkeerthi, \nAruna, Manjima (having high yield potential), and Yard-long Been-Kairali. Eight accessions \nwith unique traits were registered by the ICAR-Plant Germplasm Registration Committee based \non the evaluation and characterisation of germplasm. NBPGR conducts exhibitions, Biodiversity \nFairs for awareness generation, training for farmers etc. NBPGR is a major institution for the conservation of plant genetic resources from all \ngeographical regions of the nation. Regeneration, conservation, augmentation, characterisation \nand evaluation of plants are being operated successfully in connection with agrobiodiversity \nconservation. The extension possibilities are limited, though they are supplying seeds to the \nneedy farmers and conducting training and awareness programmes. 3.6 Non-Governmental Organizations \n3.6.1 M S Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) \nMSSRF was established in 1988 as a non-profit trust. It is an NGO which actively engages in the \narea of agrobiodiversity and aims at accelerating the use of modern science and technology for \nagricultural and rural development for improving the lives of communities. MSSRF Chennai has \nestablished a regional centre at Wayanad in 1997 namely Community Agrobiodiversity Centre \n(CAbC) to promote community conservation systems of rural and tribal people through research, \nextension and advocacy. Centre actively works for sustainable agricultural and rural \ndevelopment with the partnership of rural and farming communities. The activities of MSSRF \nare designed as pro-nature, pro-poor, pro-woman and pro-livelihood orientation. The Centre works with an objective of delivering the necessary means and methods required for \nthe on-farm management of agrobiodiversity in Wayanad region –a Biodiversity and poverty \n6.

The Centre, since its establishment, has been working in \npartnership with local community families with an integrated approach of conservation, \ncultivation, consumption and enhancing commercial prospects of community biodiversity \nmanagement. Establishment and evaluation of crop Germplasm is an important area in \nagrobiodiversity conservation. MSSRF has taken efforts to establish a food crop Germplasm \nincluding components like root tuber crops, leguminous crops and spices. The details of \ncollections at the centre and the community level conservation sites are given in the table below:  \nTable 8: Crop varieties conserved at MSSRF \nCrop varieties \nNo. of crop varieties conserved at \nCAbC Germplasm \nNo. of \nspecies \nNo. of \nVarieties/collections \nCultivated Yam \n(Dioscorea) \n3 \n15 \nWild Yam (Dioscorea) \n9 \n17 \nTaros \n3 \n13 \nOther tubers \n5 \n7 \nLegumes \n10 \n35 \nBlack pepper (cultivated) \n1 \n23 \nBlack pepper (wild) \n4 \n4 \nGinger (cultivated) \n1 \n9 \nGinger (wild) \n6 \n6 \nCitrus \n6 \n17 \nBanana/plantain \n3 \n21 \nCucurbits \n12 \n26 \nBrinjal \n1 \n6 \nSource: MSSRF  \nRecognising the importance of rice from the point of view of agrobiodiversity, MSSRF initiated \ntraditional rice conservation programme in the year 1998 in Wayanad. Initial activities on rice \nconservation were restricted to sensitization of farmers about the importance of rice ecosystems \nand production and distribution of quality seeds of traditional rice varieties. MSSRF worked in \nclose collaboration with farmer groups in different parts of the district. Participatory plant \nbreeding programme was also initiated on medicinal rice like Navara. Cultivation of Navara and \nother speciality rice varieties like Gandhakasala and Jeerakasala were promoted to exploit its \nmarket potential to generate profit from rice cultivation. The yield from traditional rice varieties \nis less, but the properties will be higher. People are generally not willing to cultivate traditional \nvarieties because of low yield and fear of loss. The fact is that tribes are cultivating traditional \nvarieties only. Propagating traditional varieties among the farmers is a challenge even though it \nhas been undertaken by the centre. In the promotion of agrobiodiversity MSSRF is actively concentrating on promotion of \ncommunity-oriented agro farming, particularly in rice cultivation. Also, the centre provides \ntraining to farmers to conserve traditional crops. It renders support and technical assistance to \nenhance the traditional agricultural production in rice and tubers for ensuring sustainable and \nprofitable agricultural practices, especially among tribes. 35 \n \n \n \nIn view of biodiversity conservation, they are maintaining a botanical garden full of endemic \nfloral species, medicinal plants and Rare Endangered and Threatened (RET) plants etc. Floristic \nwealth of Wayanad district has been explored with special emphasis on endemic and threatened \nflowering plant species. A total of 2,034 plant species were documented from 2136 sq. km area, \n26 new taxa were discovered, 2 plant species were rediscovered after long gaps since their last \nreport, 184 wild edible species, 244 medicinal species and 165 orchids were documented. A total \nof 190 threatened plant species of Western Ghats (more than 1.8 lakh seedlings) are being \nconserved through an integrated approach (in-situ, ex-situ & on farm). Recovery plan for RET \nspecies is also being conducted through identification of natural population of threatened \nspecies, along with study of the ecology and biology of threatened species, large scale \nmultiplication of prioritized species, and reintroduction/introduction into natural/suitable \nhabitats. MSSRF is maintaining good relations with the local governments in the areas of natural resource \nmanagement, \nlivelihood \nimprovement, \nbiodiversity \nconservation, \nclimate \nchange \nadaptation/mitigation. All support has been provided for the creation of artificial forest, and \nconducted a floristic study at Pathirippara, in association with Meenangadi grama panchayat. MSSRF is also participating in their carbon-neutral further programmes. MSSRF has a close \nassociation with Pozhuthana panchayat in implementing medicinal plants conservation \nprograms, river protection programmes etc. Earlier MSSRF has worked with Padinjarathara \npanchayat in establishing a bio-village program. It is reported that MSSRF has established 20 \nrice seed villages across Wayanad, in which many panchayats are associated. A noticeable point \nis that MSSRF was actively involvedin providing assistance in the preparation of PBR of local \ngovernments like Pozhuthana grama panchayat and Kalpetta municipality. MSSRF- CAbC is one of the most important institutions in the state, which closely associates \nwith the promotion of agrobiodiversity. Great importance is attached to the environment \nconservation activities of MSSRF, particularly in the biodiversity hotspot district Wayanad. 3.6.2 Thanal \nThanal is an NGO functioning from 1986 in the field of environment conservation. The head \noffice of Thanal is located at Thiruvananthapuram. The key areas of the institution are the \npromotion of organic farming, agroecology, zero waste, policy advocacy, climate change, \ncircular economy, break free from plastics, living ecosystems and agrobiodiversity conservation. Thanal was actively involved in the environment campaigns against the rise in pesticide use like \nEndosulfan. Thanal successfully facilitated zero waste campaigns, which include initiatives like \nzero waste Himalayas. Thanal has been managing the Agro-Ecology Centre (AEC), a field centre at Panavally in \nWayanad since 2010.The centre is dedicated to the conservation of indigenous crop diversity of \npaddy, tubers, turmeric, ginger and uncultivated wild leafy vegetables. It conducts seed festival \nevery year and also rice field days for students, farmers and Kudumbasree groups. The centre is \nalso a research and education centre affiliated to International People‘s Agroecology \nMultiversity offering programmes in which farmers are lead faculties. The centre is interacting \nwith academics and practitioners of organic farming to contribute to knowledge generation on \nAgroecology. Training in organic farming, organic input preparation and preparation of organic pest repellents \nare being provided for farmers. Promotion of organic products and organic farming techniques is \nan important activity. Conducting awareness campaigns for ecosystem protection, conducting \nresearch on biodiversity conservation are the other major activities. Thanal is promoting organic \n \n 36 \n \n \n \nfarming since 1990 and is practising in Thanal AEC. The manures are prepared organically \nusing cow dung, cow urine etc. (Thanal keeps its cows in the centre itself). Also, fence compost \nis being maintained in the centre. The centre provides training to the farmers in organic farming \nsince 2003 and has been helping them to market their products through the Organic Bazaar. Thanal so far has trained more than 200 master trainers for organic farming training and runs \nthree facilities in the state to train farmers and youth on organic farming. The Save our Rice Campaign, which is a national movement, was organised by Thanal in Kerala \nto revive the paddy diversity of the farming system. It is reported that thousands of farmers in \nfive states are adopting ecological farming practices, conserving and cultivating traditional \nvarieties of high-quality seeds, and ensuring the supply of organic rice to consumers across these \nstates. Conservation of traditional paddy varieties in Rice Diversity Block has been established \nas part of Save our Rice Campaign. Thanal is conserving several crop species including 336 traditional varieties of rice, 16 \nvegetables, 25 uncultivated vegetables, 7 ginger etc. (Table9). Thanal is managing on-farm \nconservation of 336 traditional varieties of rice. Organising seed festival and exchange of \ntraditional seeds without monetising and trading is another initiative.

It was a unique attempt to assess the carbon emission in the panchayat area \nparticularly in Wayanad district which has ecological significance. Carbon emission was \nestimated from transportation, energy, waste, Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use \n(AFOLU). This has motivated other grama panchayats to assess carbon emission to address \nclimate change. It could thus be seen that the two non-governmental organizations are playing a very important \nrole in diffusing technology to farmers and also in conserving a number of crop species thereby \nsaving it from extinction and (re)introducing them into everyday use. 3.7 PRIs dealing with biodiversity in general \n3.7.1 Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanical Garden Research Institute (JNTBGRI) \nJNTBGRI was established in 1979 under Government of Kerala as an autonomous institution \nand located at Palode, foothills of the Western Ghats, Thiruvananthapuram. It has become a part \nof the Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment in 2003. The institute was \nenvisioned to conserve and provide sustainable utilisation of the plant biodiversity of the \nWestern Ghats for the well being of the people. The key areas of the centre are Ex-situ \n \n 37 \n \n \n \nconservation and management of plant wealth of the country, biodiversity documentation, \nbioprospecting, documentation of indigenous knowledge, education, extension, training on \nconservation and sustainable utilisation of plants etc. JNTBGRI is renowned for its well maintained Botanical Garden spread over 300 acres. The \ngarden system of JNTBGRI is reckoned as the biggest conservatory garden in Asia with over \n50,000 accessions belonging to about 5,000 species. The Garden system is managed by the \nGarden Management Education, Information and Technology Division and the Plant Genetic \nResources Division. These divisions manage the live plants of the Garden. The institute is \nsystematically conserving medicinal plants, orchids and other flowering plants, bamboos, \nvarious rare species of flora from other parts of India, agricultural crops, spices etc. Exploring \nthe traits of plant wealth of Western Ghats region for the well being of people through research \nis a distinctive effort. JNTBGRI is actively engaged in developing effective regeneration protocols for many species to \nhelp conservation, eco-rehabilitation and sustainable utilization through biotechnological \napproach. Thrust areas of the centre are conservation, biotechnology, bioproduction of plant-\nspecific compounds and bio-prospecting. Bio-technology based cultivation of endangered plant \ntaxa became a reality in India largely through the work done in the laboratories of the centre. The institute played a great role in biodiversity management through assessing the status of \nselected species, bio-prospecting of selected species and also through multiplication and \npopularisation of important plants. RET plants in the Western Ghats region have been identified \nand conserved properly. It is reported that a database of RET species is being prepared. Conservation and re-introduction of selected RET species are being carried out in the institute. New varieties of Orchids and Bamboos have been developed through hybridisation. The institute \nstrives to develop disease-resistant plants through hybridisation which is a significant effort in \nthe context of agrobiodiversity promotion. The institute is providing technical support, \nmentoring local governments for biodiversity conservation, natural resource management etc. Several achievements have been made through the research effort of the institute. JEEVANI, a \nnovel herbal formulation for health promotion, has been developed and the technology was \ntransferred to Arya Vaidya Pharmacy (Coimbatore) Ltd. Kanjikode, Kerala, for commercial \nproduction. SISAIROSP as an anti-psoriatic and antidandruff herbal formulation and the \ntechnology was transferred to a Madhya Pradesh based company, Jhawar Chemicals Pvt.Ltd. A \nconsiderable income has been generated to the institute by transferring technologies of both of \nthese two herbal drugs (JEEVANI and SISAIROSP). Also, five Plant-based databases have been \ndeveloped by the institute. Eighteen patents in the fields of biotechnology, ethnopharmacology \nand bio-prospecting have been filed, of which seven have been granted. Being a large conservatory garden in the country, JNTBGRI disseminates the message on the \nsignificance of plant diversity among a vast group of its visitors. Also, the institute is regularly \nconducting exhibitions, training programmes and public interactions. Publications like handouts \nand brochures also help to spread the message on the relevance of conservation. Popularisation \nof plant species among the public is an important activity of the institute. JNTBGRI is \nconserving biodiversity through the protection of various species of plant wealth (Table 10), \ndeveloping new varieties, re-introduction of species, maintaining the biggest conservatory \ngarden in Asia. 38 \n \n \n \nTable 10: Wild relatives of crops and Germplasms conserved by JNTBGRI \n \nWild Relatives of Crops Conserved (Indigenous ) \n \n1.

Institute has become part of Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and \nEnvironment (KSCSTE) in 2003. The main campus of the institute is located at Peechi, Thrissur. A sub-centre is functioning at Nilamboor with laboratory facilities and field trial plots of several \ntree species. A Field Research Centre is functioning under KFRI at Velupadam,Thrissur with a \nnursery of forest plant species. KFRI is functioning for the conservation of forest ecosystem and \nsustainable utilisation of natural resources for ensuring benefits to the society. The institute is \nconducting multi-disciplinary research on tropical forestry including wildlife management, \nindigenous knowledge, value addition of forest product etc. KFRI has 17 research departments \ngrouped under 9 Programme Divisions. KFRI is managing research and other activities through \nthese divisions. KFRI is maintaining Arboretum of a wide variety of evergreen and moist deciduous trees, \nBamboo garden, a Butterfly garden with micro habitats for attracting rare, endemic and \nendangered butterflies. They are also maintaining a Central nursery, Herbarium with an \nextensive collection of flowering plants, Bioresources Nature Park at Nilamboor, Medicinal \nplants garden, Soil museum, Kerala Forest Seed Centre etc. The Central nursery has a collection \nof about 120 species of timber (that are high in demand) and also fruit-bearing and medicinal \nplants. The nursery ensures timely availability of planting material to the farmers, the general \npublic and other agencies. Kerala Forest Seed Centre established as a joint venture in 2003 with \nKerala Forest& Wildlife Department for gathering forest seeds of superior trees and distributing \ncertified seeds to the other government departments, NGOs, and farmers. 39 \n \n \n \nKFRI collects the diversity of forest soil and mineral resources in the state which is kept in the \nsoil museum. The museum has the collection of 15 soil monoliths featuring the soils in different \ntypes of forests like shoal, evergreen, semi-evergreen, moist and dry deciduous etc. In view of biodiversity conservation KFRI intervenes through the research efforts in the areas of  \nsilviculture and soil science, genetics and tree breeding, forest ecology, ecosystem and landscape \nanalysis, rehabilitation and restoration, population ecology, biodiversity evaluation and \nconservation of RET species of flora etc. Apart from this KFRI looks into various aspects of \nmicrobes, insects and weeds in the forest ecosystem, developing appropriate technologies for the \nvalue-added commercial utilization of timbers, conducting interdisciplinary research into human \nbehaviours in natural environments, providing fully-fledged training and extension facility for \nimparting training in tropical forestry, mapping forest cover and biodiversity by using GIS and \nremote sensing etc. KFRI is actively involved in the area of Agroforestry, which is a land use management system \ncombining benefits of both agriculture and forestry. Agroforestry has great importance in the \nstate because it is dependent on the Western Ghats region blessed withabundant natural \nresources. In agroforestry perspective, KFRI puts forward different crop based homestead \nmodels based on different structures of home gardens in various agro-climatic zones in the state \nfor benefitting the farmers.Tree species are being proposed toprovide indirect benefits and also \nensure self-sufficiency in case of food, fuel, wood, fodder, fruit yields, good qualitytimber and \nconsiderable good returns from the cash crops. It also promotesa mixed pattern of agriculture \nwith selected plants for getting considerable income to the farmers. Developing sustainable \nmodels of agroforestry system through farmer-participatory approach for each agro-ecological \nzone is a major intervention of KFRI. Creation of a Butterfly garden is another initiative to conserve biodiversity. The institute is \ncreating a garden of particular selected plant species based on specificities of location for \nattracting butterflies in schools, hospitals, public institutions etc., as per the demand. Also, \nregular monitoring has been ensured. The butterfly garden helps to improve the ecosystem \naround as butterflies help in pollination of plants, increasing floral richness. KFRI is propagating scientific models for the sustainable use of natural resources like soil, \nwater, various species of plants, trees, ecologically sound land use pattern etc. The institute is \nalso supplying plants, providing technical support, conservation methods, to the agencies, local \ngovernments, NGOs, farmers etc. The role of this institute is precious in front of conservation of \nbiodiversity, particularly in forestry resources of the state, which is closely associated with the \nWestern Ghats. 3.8 Insights from the analysis of the role of PRIs and NGOs \n1. Institutions are maintaining germplasm conservation of various kinds of crops, including \ntraditional varieties with the vision of future needs. 2. New varieties have been developed through crop improvement for high yield, disease \nresistance, etc. 3. Institutions are facing challenges and limitations in the extension services. Only \npassionate farmers or interested agencies are utilising the services of these institutions. Lack of proper knowledge about these institutions and the importance of agricultural \npractices among the public are serious concerns. 4. In view of the extension possibilities, NGOs are seen to be performing better as \ncompared to the government institutions, by collaborating with local governments and \n \n 40 \n \n \n \nintervention at grassroots level through community mobilisation. Collaboration with \nlocal governments is more significant in the promotion of agrobiodiversity. 5. Absence of a central monitoring system in order to promote agrobiodiversity in the state, \nto coordinate all the research outputs from the public research institutions has been \nnoticed. 4. The cases of 4 modelGrama Panchayats \nIn this section, we analyse the role of four local self-governments from across Kerala who can \njustifiably be termed as model grama panchayats as far as the appreciation and maintenance of \nagrobiodiversity and indeed biodiversity, in general, is concerned. Our selection of these \npanchayats hasbeen guided by the fact that they have either been selected as the best \nBMCseither by the National Biodiversity Authority or the Kerala State Biodiversity Board \n(Table 11)12. Besides, one of the four has been hailed as a model panchayat for organic vegetable \ncultivation and has a long history of being the only panchayat in the whole state of Kerala that is \nself-sufficient in vegetable cultivation. The purpose of conducting these case studies is to \nunderstand and place on the table those practical points that other panchayats can emulate. It is \nalso seen that all the four panchayats have adopted a different strategy towards agrobiodiversity \nthus bringing home the point that there is no one model that fits all. Each of the panchayats have \nimprovised strategies that are specific to the needs of respective panchayats. These range from \nrejuvenation and maintenance of water bodies to vegetable cultivation to maintenance of forest \ncover. We also see that success in the maintenance of agrobiodiversity is linked to the presence \nof two important factors. These are: (i) a strategy for agrobiodiversity is basically a function of \nwhether it is inexorably linked to a livelihood strategy. If it is, then there can be widespread \nacceptance of management of agrobiodiversity as it can bring in immediate tangible benefits to \nthe inhabitants of those villages. Otherwise, the notion of agrobiodiversity can remain as a \ntheoretical concept, the benefits of which are understood only by a few people who are \nenvironmentally oriented. Such individuals are, unfortunately, short in supply; and (ii) successful \nimplementation of the agrobiodiversity strategy requires the presence of a charismatic mentor \nwhose leadership is widely accepted and who is extremely resourceful. It is very often the \npresence of such individuals who make a big difference to the successful implementation of \nagrobiodiversity policies and not other institutional mechanisms such as the BMCs.This, of \ncourse, has the danger of the whole strategy fizzling out with the eclipse of this mentor from the \nhorizon.

The case studies are \nstructured as follows. We first provide a brief profile of the panchayat. This is followed by a \ndiscussion and evaluation of the \nformal \ninstitutional \nmechanism \nfor \nmaintaining \nagrobiodiversity, namely the formation of a BMC and the existence of a PBR. Subsequently, we \ndistil out the specific strategies adopted by the villages. The common insights that we could \nlearn from the four are summarised and presented in this section as well. 4.1 KanjikuzhiGrama Panchayat- Agrobiodiversity through livelihood strategies \n \n \nProfile:Kanjikuzhigrama panchayat is situated in Kanjikuzhiblock panchayat of Alappuzha \ndistrict bounded by Mannancherry, Muhamma, Thanneermukkam and Mararikkulamgrama \npanchayats. The total geographical area of the grama panchayat is 16.62 sq.kms. The panchayat \nhas 8516 families across 18 wards and the total population is 29951 persons 13. Beginning from \n1994 Kanjikuzhisurpassed its geographical deficit of being sand-like soil-deprived region which \nwas not suitable for vegetable cultivation with the collective effort of panchayat and \ngovernment. The panchayat decided to come up with different policies and programmes that \nwould encourage farmers to initiate organic farming with utmost dedication. In fact, twenty \nyears down the line it is the only panchayat in the state that is self-sufficient in vegetable \ncultivation. The panchayat has a diverse cropping pattern (see Table 12). BMC \nBMC was formed in 2008, consisting of 8 members as per the guidelines. In 2011 BMC \nprepared People‘s Biodiversity Register (PBR). The BMC was reconstituted in 2015, but the \nminutes of the meeting are not available. After the reconstitution of the BMC, it has not been \nactive, and no meeting has been conducted so far. The technical assistance and financial support \nfrom the State Biodiversity Board (SBB) havebeen received for the preparation of PBR. The \nBMC reported that they have participated in various training programmes conducted by the \nKSBB. It is reported that after the preparation of PBR, BMC is actively involved in the \nprotection of ‗kaavu‘ and afforestation activities by utilising MGNREGS labourers. The Panchayat is associated with Kudumbasreeand Harithakeralam Mission to implement an \neco-friendly waste management system. Plastic waste is being collected from the houses and \n                                                                 \n13Data taken from Development Report of Kanjhikuzhi Grama Panchayat \n \n 42 \n \n \n \ninstitutions every month by KudumbasreeHarithakarmaSena at the rate of Rs.30/- per \nhousehold. Harithakeralam Mission collects this waste for recycling purpose. PBR \nThe PBR was prepared in 2011 July as per the instructions of KSBB. BMC members reported \nthat the survey team comprising of Kudumbasree members, local people (who had traditional \nknowledge), students etc. have been deputed for each ward to collect the data. Each team \nconsisted of nearly 20 people who are actively involved in the survey. They have collected \ninformation from the ward level and then consolidated it as per the guidance from the KSSB \ncoordinators. The coordinators of KSBB have visited the Panchayat and have given orientation \ntraining to the survey team. The preparation of PBR was completed within three months. Yearly \nupdation of the PBR seems to be missing in this panchayat. Therefore, verification of the bio-\ndiversity and species mentioned in the PBR was not possible. Moreover, the BMC was not \nactive after this exercise. In 2015, BMC was reconstituted by the Panchayat but no Action Plan \nhas been formulated since then. The PBR is not updated and it is reported that they have not \nreceived any clear order from KSBB for the updation of PBR. Annual review of PBR has not \nbeen conducted so far. Agrobiodiversity of the Panchayat is significant as per the PBR. In the Panchayat 120 species of \nvarious crops are being cultivated. It includes 10 varieties of paddy and coconut, 41 varieties of \n12 vegetables, 8 varieties of tapioca, 9 varieties of yam and 18 varieties of other tubers. Forty-\nseven varieties of medicinal plants were identified, and most of them come under the RET \ncategory. In the case of wild plants, 81 varieties of medicinal plants, 15 wild crops and 52 wild \ntrees were also identified. As per the PBR 47 varieties of livestock and pets are being reared in \nthe Panchayat. As far as ecosystem diversity is concerned, 44 kaavuand 22 wet lands have been \nidentified. The cropping pattern of the panchayat is presented in Table 12. It is reported that Panchayat is protecting ponds and water bodies by using geo-textiles (coir \nbhoovasthram) on the walls of ponds and canals with the help of MGNREGS workers. Cleaning \nof these water bodies has also been completed by utilising this scheme effectively. Planting \ntrees, construction of bio fencing (jaivaveli), were the major activities of the Panchayat to protect \nIllathukaavu. Illathukaavuis popular with endemic species of wild plants like calophyllumcalaba \nlocally known as cherupunna).But in the field visit, bio fencing was not seen anywhere in the \nkaavu and it was demolished and the premises of kaavu was being utilised as a playground. Lack \nof proper fencing and protection literally turned the kaavu into a littering ground. Only the fallen \ntrees are not been taken away mainly because that is forbidden as per the local belief. A temple \nis still functioning in the middle of the kaavu. Such temples may be part of this entire kaavu \necology, but the question is how to protect the flora and fauna with the existence of a temple and \nactivity around it. The panchayat is yet evolving a reasonable strategy to conserve this sacred \nplace because, it seems, the existing mechanism will adversely affect the health and existence \nofthekaavu in the long run. The primary function of the BMC is to maintain a document on local biological resources and \nassociated traditional knowledge. Conservation, sustainable use, and documentation of \nbiodiversity and equitable sharing of benefits, arising from its use, are also coming under the \nmandate of BMC. Generally, most of the Biodiversity Management Committees (BMC) in all \nlocal self-government institutions is not functional after the preparation of PBR and have failed \nto exercise their power and responsibility mainly due to the lack of awareness. Kanjikuzhi \npanchayat is also an example of this. 43 \n \n \n \nThe panchayat has been very successful in maintaining agrobiodiversity in the panchayat by \nlinking it to livelihood strategy and this appears to be working well as the people are deriving a \ncontinuous source of income. Although the formal institutional mechanism for managing \nagrobiodiversity exists in the panchayat, these have been invoked very rarely. The experience of \nthe panchayat though worthy of emulation has not even been followed by neighbouring \npanchayats.

It shares its boundary with Chengannur Municipality, Koipram,Kuttoorgrama \npanchayats and the Manimala river. The total geographical area of the panchayat is 18.64 \nsq.kms, and the total population as per the census 2011 is 25200 persons only across its 17 \nwards14. Eraviperoor the place has become economically prosperous due to large migration to \nthe foreign countries. The place is renowned for different religious cultures and socio-cultural \nreformations. 14Data taken from Development Report of Eraviperoor Grama Panchayat \nSl.No. Crops \nArea under \ncultivation \n(in hectare) \n1.

Eraviperoor has become the first grama panchayat in the country to receive a national award for \npublic administration. Moreover, this is also the maiden public administration award received by \nan institution or individual from Kerala. Eraviperoor grama panchayat has been recognised and \nawarded from several times for its excellence in the service delivery and now it becomes \nEraviperoormodel, which is replicating 12 States. In 2013, Eraviperoor was selected for the award for biodiversity conservation instituted by the \nState Biodiversity Board and the Sanitation Award of the State Sanitation Mission. In the same \nyear, the state Horticulture Department selected the village as a model hi-tech green village on \naccount of banana plantations by 42 women groups who cooperated with each other to earn \nprofits not just for themselves, but also for the village. This is the only panchayat in the state has \nreceived ISO-9001 certification for it's Primary Health Centre (PHC). It has also won the state \ngovernment‘s Health Award and Pain and Palliative Care Award for 2014-15. Now the PHC is \nconverted as Family Health Centre (FHC) under Aardram Mission of Government of Kerala. FHC is functioning with ample facilities of Yoga, Fitness Centres etc. with the integration of the \nAyush project. As far as the activities of Biodiversity Management Committee (BMC) are \nconcerned, the panchayat was chosen for the award for Best BMC from National Biodiversity \nAuthority in 2018. Eraviperoor became the first grama panchayat in the country to provide free Wi-Fi to the general \npublic. Villagers can access free Wi-Fi facility within a one-kilometre radius of five different \npanchayat institutions. Besides this, the panchayat has touch screen kiosks for the public to \nlocate their files in ultra-modern Panchayat record rooms. The panchayat has given priority to e-\ngovernance at the grassroots level. It is reported that the panchayat is planning to implement \n‗Panchayat to People Kiosks‘ programme under its own risk. People can access the services of \npanchayat within their locality through these Kiosks. Software has been developed to implement \nthis programme. BMC \nBMC was initially constituted on 10/12/2010 and reconstituted on 18/01/2015 with a \nchairperson, convenor, secretary and seven members. The major mandate of the BMC was the \npreparation of Peoples Biodiversity Register (PBR) in the beginning period; it was prepared on \nFebruary 2011. The panchayat officials reported that BMC is functioning with three major areas, \ni.e., water conservation, food security and protection of the environment. Water conservation \nThe panchayat constructed 1.45 lakhs rain pits for groundwater recharging under the monitoring \nof BMC. Protection and reformation of traditional water bodies, and mini drinking water \nprojects, Sujalam drinking water project in association with the M S Swaminathan Foundation \nare the other projects implementing underwater conservation. PBR \nBMC reported that technical supports and capacity building had been received from state \nBiodiversity Board in the initial period for the preparation of PBR. Within the one year period, \nthe whole process of preparation of PBR had been completed. The survey group for each ward \nhad been formulated comprising of Kudumbashree members, local people and students to collect \ndata. Total of 63 persons had been engaged in the survey for all wards. The survey had been \ncompleted within two months. There was no delay in preparation of PBR. Eraviperoor became \nthe first grama panchayat in Pathanamthitta district in preparation of PBR. Financial support \n \n 45 \n \n \n \nfrom KSBB has been received by the panchayat for the preparation of PBR, creation of Star \nForest and Carbon Neutral Project. BMC has prepared a project as part of its Action Plan for the construction of organic fertiliser \nunit. This unit will collect all type of organic waste from the panchayat area for the processing of \nfertiliser. It is expected to avoid chemical fertilisers from the agricultural sector by supplying \nthis organic fertiliser for the cultivation of Eraviperoor Rice and other agricultural crops. Organic farming has been promoting in the agricultural sector, especially for vegetables, but \nfarmers are using chemical fertilisers in the paddy cultivation (Eraviperoor rice) extensively. There was no separate scheme prepared for the protection of Kaavu,-wetland ecosystems. Annual review of PBR has not been conducted so far. As far as protection of natural resources is \nconcerned, BMC is planning to implement ‗Tree Pledging instead of Cutting‘ Project, Varattar \nProtection Scheme, Implementation of user fee for the houses having tiled courtyard etc. As per the PBR data, nearly 140 varieties of agricultural crops have been cultivated including \nfood crops, cash crops, spices, vegetables and tubers. Out of this 35 varieties of vegetables and \n40 varieties of tubers had been identified. In the PBR, 104 varieties of medicinal plants, 76 wild \nanimals, 10 items of flora and 15 items of fauna in the water bodies, had been recorded. Only 24 \nvarieties of livestock and pets are being reared in the Panchayat. Two rivers (Varattar and \nManimala), one canal and 4 thodu (water streams) and 2 ponds (under private custody) have \nbeen identified as water bodies within the panchayat area. BMC reported that PBR has to be \nupdated and digitalised by adding up of new data based on the new survey. It is expected to be \nachieved within a short period of time. From the field level observation,Eraviperoor panchayat is ensuring the involvement of BMC in \nthe process of implementation of several conventional projects of grama panchayats also like \nconstruction of rain pits, agricultural promotion, providing drinking water etc., given these \nprojects are related to environment assets. Rejuvenation of Varattar river, efforts for removing \nencroachments, etc., were the outstanding measures in front of the environment protection. A \nnotable point is that conducting Eco-Grama Sabha in all wards was a unique attempt of \nEraviperoor grama panchayat and it generated environmental awareness among the people. It \nalso encouraged disclosing more suggestions and ensuring the participation of people in \nenvironment conservation. 4.2.1 Varattar-Aadi Pamba rejuvenation \nThe most important activity of BMC was the rejuvenation of a river - -Varattar and Aadi Pamba. Varattaar is a tributary of Aadi Pamba and it reaches Manimala River. Varattar was the main \nsource of water for hundreds of households in its earlier period. This river had a natural \nimportance that acted as a natural flood control mechanism between Pamba and Manimala \nrivers, carrying the excess water from both ways. Due to the land encroachment and sand \nmining, it became a drought river forthelast 35 years, and some people were using the banks of \nthis area for cultivation purpose. The grama panchayat has taken initiatives to sketch out the \nboundaries of the river using land records. It is reported that there were many hurdles that had \ntobefaced in the initial time. BMC prepared an action plan under MGNREGS to rejuvenate the \nriver, and the activities started in 2013-14. The rejuvenation activities were implemented with \nthe people‘s participation. All obstructions towards the natural pathway of the river were \nremoved by cleaning and chopping away of branches of trees by MGNREGS workers and local \npeople, and removal culverts across the river. 46 \n \n \n \n \nCreation of river pathway \n(Photo is taken from Panchayat records-PPT slides) \n \n13.5 acres of riverbank has been regained with the magnificent efforts of the panchayat. The \nDPR is prepared and submitted to the Haritha KeralamMission. The first stage has been \ncompleted within 3 months without any government aid, but Rs.80 crore has been announced for \nthe rejuvenation by the state government in the second stage. Varattar is flowing through the nearest local governments of Eraviperoor, i.e. Koippram and \nKuttoor panchayats and Chengannoor municipality. Eraviperoor panchayat has triggered actions \natthe beginning for the rejuvenation of Varattaar. It generated a compulsion to participate in \nother nearest local governments which are sharing the banks of Varattar. The rejuvenation of the \nriver programme has become the major environmental conservation programme of nearest \npanchayats and Chengannoor municipality along with Eraviperoor panchayat with the support of \ndistrict administration and Haritha Keralam Mission. Varatte...Aaru.....(Let river come) Riverwalk campaign was organised by the local governments \nand hundreds of people gathered on the banks of Varattar river including political leaders, \nministers and MLAs. It was a noticeable campaign, and it created awareness among the local \npeople about the importance to rejuvenate the river. The river rejuvenation programme comes \nunder the purview of state recognised River Rejuvenation Scheme now. Riverwalk campaign  \n \n \nThe flowing river  \n(Phots are taken from Panchayat records-PPT slides) \n \nThe grama panchayat has taken measures to remove all obstructions in the beginning part of the \nVarattar that connects with Aadi Pamba. This connecting point of Varattar with Aadi Pamba is a \ncrucial place to ensure the water flow of Varattar from Aadi Pamba. The major efforts of river \nrejuvenation process of Eraviperoor grama panchayat havebeen executed in this area. The river \nstarted flowing through its forgotten path once the path was almost cleared by the abundant \nmonsoon rain. The boat race has been conducted in the river Aadi Pamba with the initiatives of \ngrama panachayat. This was a true festival for the people and they had celebrated immensely. 47 \n \n \n \nBut Varattar has dried up now due to the scorching summer. Water flow can be seen only in a \nfew places of the river. Sand wall and other types of blockages have been restricting the natural \nflow of Varattar. It is expected that the water flow will be restored after the monsoon. According \nto the Panchayat, more actionisneeded again to revive the river with the participation of nearest \nlocal governments. The present condition of Varattar is a dried river as shown below. Present condition of Varattaar  \n(Photo is taken during our field visit) \n \n \n4.2.2 Food security \nEraviperoor panchayat introduced a scheme for paddy cultivation with an aim to achieve self-\nsufficiency in rice production. The panchayat has identified 40-hectare fallow lands and has \ntaken from the owners on the basis of lease and handed over to the farmers for the cultivation. An agreement has been executed by the panchayat with landowners. Seed, fertilisers and other \ninfrastructures have been provided by the panchayat in association with Krishi Bhavan. Panchayat has created irrigation facilities for the paddy cultivation in the fallow land using \nMGNREGS workers. A fifteen-member Kudumbasree entrepreneur group named as \n‘Swadesabhimani’ procure paddy from the farmers at the support price fixed by the government \nwith the fostering of the panchayat. After processing, the rice is packed in 5 kg and 10 kg cloth \nbags and soldto the needy people in the brand name of ‘Eraviperoor Rice’. A cloth bag unit is \nalso functioning with the financial support of the panchayat. The subsidies for the procurement \nand marketing have been provided by the panchayat with the help of Kudumbasree Mission in \nthe initial time. It is reported that Kudumbasree unit has now become profitable, and they are \nactively engaged in procurement, processing and marketing. The Kudumbasree members \nreported that panchayat is monitoring the functions of the unit and providing all kinds of \nnecessary supports. In the absence of rice processing mill in the panchayat area, they depend on \nthe nearest district for the paddy processing. Therefore panchayat is planning to establish their \nown rice processing mill with modern facilities, and it is expected to reducethe production cost \nof Eraviperoor Rice. 4.2.3 Environment \nEraviperoor grama panchayat has organised a special grama sabha- ‗Eco-grama sabha‘- in all the \nwards for environment conservation. It was the best method to spread environment awareness to \nthe people. All suggestions emerged from the grama sabha have been recorded and formulated in \nan action plan based on it. Waste management is one of the important activities of the panchayat. A plastic shredding unit has been functioning in the panchayat, and it is also providing \nemployment to a few women. Plastic waste is being collected from the houses and institutions \nevery month by KudumbasreeHarithakarmaSena at the rate of Rs.30/- per household. These \nplastics are dumped into the plastic shredding unit for the processing. After shredding process, \nthe plastics are handed over for the use of road tarring. It is reported that people from \n \n 48 \n \n \n \noutsidethepanchayat area are also collecting these processed plastics for road tarring \npurpose,therebygeneratinga reasonable income. Panchayat officials have reported that the \nmaintenance cost of the road can be reduced through the promotion of plastic tarring roads. As \nper the records, 6714.5 kg plastics havebeen collected during the period from 2012-13 to 2017-\n18, out of it 5284 kg was used for road tarring and generated Rs.60650/- as income.15 A scheme \nfor construction of compost pits in all households is also introduced for the processing of organic \nwaste. Varieties of trees have been planted in the panchayat area through the afforestation activity by \nutilising MGNREGS labourers. Medicinal plants are also planted in the premises of Family \nHealth Centre. The QR code has been created for each plant and placed in it to get all \ninformation related to each plant. Lakhs of Areca nut tree have been planted in Aadipamba –\nVarattar area. Panchayat has released all encroachments in this area and planted Areca nut tree \nwith the aim of getting Areca nut leaves (paala- local name) for the famous Hindu cultural \nfestival ‗padayani‘. Arecanut tree and its leaves- paala is an important item for the Padayani \nfestival. Planting trees and medicinal plants and its conservation is an important activity of the \npanchayat in keeping with environment protection which is monitored by the BMC. The \nPresident of the panchayat said that littering waste and chopping trees are punishable in the \npanchayat area. A camera has been installed in important places, and panchayat will impose fine \nas per the recommendations of BMC. Reducing street light billing to zero is another mission of BMC by fixing solar panels over \npanchayat and transferred offices. BMC reported that an effort had been taken to digitalise the \nPBR. BMC is planning to collect biodiversity data once again for the digitalisation. Along with \nthis carbon-neutral study is ongoing now. The survey has been conducted in some wards of the \npanchayat to get the information related to the volume of carbon emission from each household \nand institution. A special grama sabha for carbon-neutral has been organised. The panchayat \naims to become carbon-neutral village in 2020-21 by planting trees, reducing plastics and all \ntype of pollutions. 4.3 Meenangadi Grama Panchayat- Creation of an artificial forest and becoming the \n first carbon-neutral panchayat in India \n \n \n \n \nProfile:Meenangadi grama panchayat (GP) is located 1022 meter above the sea level and \nbelongs to Sultan Battery Block Panchayat of Wayanadu district. The total area is 53.51 sq.km \n                                                                 \n15Data from panchayat records (PPT slides) \n \n 49 \n \n \n \nand having 19 wards and 8199 families. According to the Census 2011, the total population of \nthe Panchayat is 33450. The average rainfall is 221 mm16. The major occupation of the people is \nagriculture and livestock rearing. The total agriculture area is 4919 ha., and major crops \ncultivated in the area are paddy, coffee, pepper, plantains, coconut, rubber, areca nut, ginger, \nturmeric, tapioca, elephant foot yam, great yam, taro root etc. The Panchayat is prosperous with \nfour rivers i.e., Nurasipuzha, Purakkadipuzha, Chundalipuzha,Kuttirayinpuzha and 23 streams. The forest area is 2.7 percent of the total area of the Panchayat. A lot of public institutions are \nfunctioning in the Panchayat area. The public infrastructure comprising road connectivity, \ndrinking water, electricity is also good. Besides this, the National Highway NH 766 (212), and \nState Highway pass through the panchayat area. BMC \nBMC of Meenagadi GP was formed in 2008. This is one of the first GPs in Wayanad who \nprepared People‘s Biodiversity Register (PBR). BMC was reconstituted on 14/11/2016. The \nPanchayat has appointed an active environmentalist Shri.Pavithran Master who is a retired \ngovernment School headmaster, as the convenor of BMC. BMC has been functioning very \nactivelyand an Action Plan for environment conservation has been formulated since then. BMC \nis actively involved in the environment preservation activities apart from the preparation of PBR, \nwhich include conducting carbon-neutral study, the formation of Manikavu Bamboo Park, \nconducting biodiversity study- Kolagappara, Kavukal, seed bank, School level club activities, \nPBR updation etc. The immense support from active NGOs like MSSRF has been noted as \ncrucial in the activities of BMC. In 2018 Meenangadi won the best BMC award from the State Biodiversity Board and received a \nspecial mention from the National Biodiversity Authority. The BMC is functioning \nsystematically in Meenangadi GP. The BMC meetings are organise every three months and \nminutes are maintained in the office. A separate office room is provided for the functions of \nBMC. The Rapid Assessment of Biodiversity loss due to floods and landslides has been \ncompleted with the support of MSSRF recently. 4.3.1 Activities of BMC \nCarbon-Neutral Panchayat-More actions have been taken by Meenangadi with the aim of \nbecoming India‘s first carbon-neutral panchayat. Carbon emission was estimated from \ntransportation, energy, waste, Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU). Meenangadi \nhas conducted a waste audit and energy audit in households and institutions to measure the \nquantities of waste generation and energy emissions. Similarly, the emission from transportation \nhas also been calculated. The carbon-neutral study has been conducted with the support of \nexperts and NGO-Thanal-. Further actions have been coordinated by BMC with the frequent \nconsultation with eminent experts, IIT researchers, experts from leading universities etc. based \non the recommendations of the study. The efforts of Meenangadi are valuable and effectual in \nthe context of Wayanad,whichis one of the districts in the state that are labelled climate change \nhotspots. Punyavanam – It is an artificial forest engendered by BMC in 44 acres of land. It has been \nconservedasa forest with the support of MSSRF, Social forestry and MGNREGS since 2005. MSSRF was the key player from 2005; later the panchayat and BMC have been involved \nactively from 2012 to create an artificial forest with the support of MGNREGS and social \n                                                                 \n16Data taken from Development Report of Meenangadi Grama Panchayat \n \n 50 \n \n \n \nforestry. Trees belong to 115 species of the Western Ghats region have been planted in \nPunyavanam, and now it became a forest having varieties of trees, birds and animals. Pathirippara-Conservation and studies about biodiversity-A study has been conducted on the \nbiodiversity system in Pathirippara under the monitoring of BMC with the support of MSSRF. The floristic study conducted by MSSRF, documented a total number of 142 taxa of flowering \nplants belonging to 123 genera and 54 families from this area. Dicotyledons dominate with 123 \nSpecies belonging to 108 genera 45 families constitute 86.6 percent of total flora and \nmonocotyledons have 19 species 15 genera from 8 families constitute 13.4 percent of floristic \nrichness in this rocky area17. This area has been conserving and protecting from rock mining and \nunauthorised human interventions. The panchayat is planning to explore this area for an eco-\ntourism point. Protection of Kaavu and Keni- BMC conducted studies on 48 Kaavu and traditional Keni \nprotecting by tribes. Protection of 48 Kaavu and promotion of traditional knowledge sharing is \none of the major activities of BMC. Traditional Keni (small water well constructed by tribes having crystal clear water) is an \nimportant water source of tribes, and they are considering this as holy water. A day of tribe \nfamily starts with this holy water, and it has natural and cultural importance. The water level of \nthese Kenis will not change even in the drought situation. Conversion of Barren land into cultivable land-Panchayat has identified acres of barren land after \ncutting teak which was distributed by the government to the tribes for their housing and \nlivelihood in accordance with the Forest Right Act. This area was completely barren and \nisolated; nothing can be cultivated. The panchayat has taken a mission to implement livelihood \nagricultural project i.e., Agro root and Agro veg in this area. Tribes were not interested in living \nin this area because of the isolation and uncultivable barren land. Panchayat implemented Agro \nroot project(supplying various kinds of tubers seeds for cultivation) with the labour support from \nMGNREGS. Tribes of this area are also included in the MGNREGS scheme so that they had \ncultivated in their own land with the government wage. This kind of support of panchayat \ncreated motivation for cultivation and attracted tribes to live there. Similarly,Agro veg project \n(supplying various kinds of vegetable seeds for cultivation)wasimplemented. Apart from this, \nvarious kinds of trees have been planted through afforestation activities in this area. There was \nno well water in earlier times. Six water wells are functioning now in this area after creating rain \npits and greenery. Tribes are cultivating various kinds of vegetables and tubers and rearing live \nstocks in this area for their needs and selling purpose. Now the area can be seen as a normal \ngreenery living place with the fabulous and exemplary attempts of panchayat and BMC. Community Seed Bank-The measures have been taken for the conservation and extension of \ntraditional varieties of crops especially paddy, pepper and tubers. The panchayat has identified \nfarmers who have been cultivating the traditional crops and created a directory of farmers. The \ntechnical assistance, awareness, public recognition, seed fest, subsidies for cultivation etc. have \nbeen provided for them. Attakkolli Biodiversity park-Conservation of screw pine plants and bamboo in the banks of the \npond was a major activity of BMC. Screwpine has an exceptional capacity for the protection of \nthe banks of rivers and canals from erosion. Its fibrous root system also helps in keeping the \n                                                                 \n17As per the data of floristic study conducted at Pathirippara by MSSRF \n \n 51 \n \n \n \nalluvial soil intact and maintaining the water-holding capacity of the soil. Premises of pond are \nbeautifully maintained as a park with a tiled walkway and flowering plants. Biodiversity clubs –BMC has formulated biodiversity clubs in the government, aided and un- \naided schools. This is creating environmental awareness among the students. Biodiversity Bamboo Park at Manikavu -All varieties of bamboos in the Western Ghats area will \nbe protected in this park. Other activities \nBMC is conducting Biodiversity awareness campaigns frequently. Planting and conserving \nmedicinal plants in the premises of the Ayurveda hospital and school garden is another activity \nof BMC. BMC has identified premises of school land for planting various species of plants by \nutilising the labour force of MGNREGS. A bamboo park consisting of various types of bamboo \nin a school has been designed and planted by BMC,whichis a more attractive one and creates \neco-friendly educational atmosphere. Planting highly Rare, Endangered and Threatened (RET) \nendemic plants of 45 species in the PurakkadiDevaswam land with the support of MSSRF \n(highly RET garden in four acres of land) is another project of BMC. It aims at all endemic \nhighly RET species in the Western Ghats area of Wayanad which can meet at a single place. It is \nreported that an agreement has to be executed with the Devaswam Board to use their land for the \nplanting of RET species. Discussions are ongoing to implement this project soon. For protecting eco system BMC is actively involved in the conservation of traditional natural \nresources as mentioned above. BMC conducted studies on 48 Kaavu protecting by tribes, \ntraditional Keni (small water well constructed by tribes), Pathirippara etc., Preservation of \nAttakkollyJaiva Park, Maalikavu Bamboo Park, creation of artificial forest, conserving RET \ngarden are the major activities of BMC taking into account of the protection of natural resources. A plastic shredding unit has been constructed toestablishaneco-friendly waste management \nsystem. The panchayat is promoting door to door collection of plastic waste every two weeks in \na month with the help of KudumbasreeHarithakarma Sena members. This waste is dumped into \nthe shredding unit for further processing. The pipe compost units are also be given to the houses \nfor biodegradable waste processing. PBR \nThe PBR was prepared in 2012 as per the instructions of KSBB. The survey team had been \nformulated for each ward of the panchayat. Each team had 10 people comprising of experts, \nteachers, students and ward members. All data of biological resources have been collected and \nrecorded. Training and supports, technical advice and financial assistance from the State \nBiodiversity Board have been utilised. As per the PBR,Meenangadi has 156 types of agricultural \ncrops in cultivation including 71 types of paddy, 20 types of vegetables, 23 types of tubers, 41 \ntypes of cash crops and one type of Ragi. Considering the fruit crops, 52 types were cultivated. A lot of wild plants had been identified which included 88 types of wild medicinal plants. The \ntotal number of floral species was recorded as 572. The total number of faunal species was 327, \nwhich included 272 wild animals. Paddy, various tubers, vegetables, ragi, plantains, mango tree, jackfruit, lemon, etc., have been \nidentified as the agro biological resources in the panchayat area. Meenangadi GP introduced the \nseed bank programme to protect these resources by providing technical assistance, awareness \nprogrammes, public recognition, seed fest etc., to the identified farmers to cultivate the \ntraditional crops. Organic vegetable cultivation is being promoted by the GP. It is ongoing in 67 \n \n 52 \n \n \n \nacres of land. These organic cultivated vegetables are sold through Kudumbasree fest, Onam \nfest, Vishu fest etc., and through the selling outlet run by Kudumbasree. The PBR was prepared seven years back. It is reported that the data is almost collected again for \nthe updation of PBR. An NGO has been identified by the panchayat to digitalise the PBR and the \nadvance amount of money has been transferred already. BMC reported that it has been \ninformedfrom the State Biodiversity Board that the digitalisation process has to be ensured by \nusing the official software. But the software of Bio-Diversity Board is in developing stage only. Therefore the updation of PBR is pending. From the field level evaluation of BMC of Meenangadi grama panchayat, it is observed that \nthere is no separate fund for the programmes of BMC. Such paucity of funds of \nBMCwasovercomeby the panchayat through its splendid efforts of discerning allocation \nstrategy. Some of the projectsimplemented by the panchayat are directly or indirectly related to \nthe environmental assets. The panchayatis able to allocate enough fundsin the budget to \nimplement such projects. Panchayat officials reported that consultation with BMC members has \nbeen ensured in the process of implementation of projects which are directly or indirectly related \nto environmental assets. Therefore such projects can be implemented in accordance with the \naction plan of BMC. Effective use of MGNREGS and coordination of other schemes are the key \nfactors of the success of Meenangadi. Moreover, measures of Meenangadito become India‘s first \ncarbon-neutral panchayat are the exemplary efforts and valuable in the context of biodiversity \nconservation. 4.4  Marancherry Grama Panchayat-Maintenance of Kole Wetland \n \n \nProfile:Marancherry grama panchayat is located at Perumbadappu block panchayat of \nMalappuram district. The total geographical area of the panchayat is 20.47 sq.kms, and the total \npopulation is 35360 persons across its 19 wards 18 . Marancherry is nearest of Ponnani \nMunicipality and Veliyamcodu, Edappal grama panchayats and bounded with rivers, canals and \nBiyyam Lake. The majority of people depend on agriculture. Coconut is the major crop in \ncultivation. A large number of water bodies, canals, and small water streams are flowing through \nMarancherry village. 18Data taken from Development Report of  Marancherry  Grama Panchayat \n \n 53 \n \n \n \nBMC \nBMC was initially constituted in 2011 as per the government order. But it was not active until \n2015. The BMC has embarked on its activities after its reconstitution in 2015. BMC has been \nconducting meetings every three months, and the minutes of the meetings are recorded properly. An Action Plan has been formulated for the activities of BMC which includes water \nconservation, mangrove conservation, wetland conservation, creation of Nakshathravanam (Star \nForest) project etc. Guidance and training from State Bio-Diversity Board has triggered the \nsmooth functioning of BMC. It is reported that the grama panchayat allocated one lakh rupees \nfor preparing PBR. SBB sanctioned an amount of Rs.4.5 lakhs considering it as a model BMC, \nfor further activities, mainly for the creation of Nakshathravanam (Star Forest). In the \nfurtherance of creating environmental awareness, BMC had conducted an exhibition cum \nsymposium. In 2019, Marancherry has been selected for the best BMC award of Kerala State \nBiodiversity Board. 4.4.1 Activities of BMC \na) Water conservation \nA lot of water bodies like canals, streams (thodu), ponds, rivers, and Biyyam lake is \nflowing through the panchayat area. Protection of these water bodies is one of the major \nactivities of the panchayat. It is reported that 7.2 kms of new streams/thodu has been \nconstructed and more than 15 kms of old streams have been rejuvenated. New ponds \nhave been constructed in the private lands as per the needs of the farmers/individuals \nunder MGNREGS scheme. It will also be amplified groundwater recharging. Cleaning of \nwater bodies, construction of sidewall, paving geotextiles, are also implemented through \nthis scheme. The panchayat has taken initiatives for planting bamboos in the river and \ncanal sides through MGNREGS under the monitoring of BMC to prevent soil erosion. b) Mangrove and Bamboo planting/conservation \nNatural mangrove forest can be seen in some areas of the panchayat. The panchayat has \ntaken measures to conserve these mangroves and replanting new mangroves in the river \nand lakesides. BMC officials reported that more than thousand new mangroves have \nbeen planted in the lakesides by the applying labour force of MGNREGS. Moreover, \nvarious kinds of bamboo have been planted in the river and canal sides. Mangrove \n  Bamboo      \n                                       (Photos are taken from field visit) \n \nc) Plastic processing unit \nA plastic processing unit has been functioning in the panchayat area. This unit is \nmanaging by the panchayat to ensure eco-friendly waste management system. This unit \nis also providing employment to a few people and the wages met by the panchayat. Plastic waste is being collected from the houses and institutions every month by \nKudumbasreeHarithakarmaSena at the rate of Rs.30/- per household. These plastics are \ndumped into the plastic processing unit. After sorting, the plastics carry bags are put into \n \n 54 \n \n \n \nthe processing machine for liquefying by electric heating. The liquid form of plastics will \nbe turned into dry pieces which are sold to private companies for the manufacturing of \ntarpaulin sheets and other value-added products. Panchayat officials reported that plastics \nfrom nearest local governments are being brought to this unit for processing. It is \nreported that the environment pollution clearance has been accredited already by the \nPollution Control Board. With regard to biodegradable waste processing, biogas and pipe \ncompost units are also being promoted. d) Biodiversity documentation \nMarancherryKole wetland is one of the key biodiversity areas which has been identified \nby the State Biodiversity Board. The Kole wetlands are low lying fields located 0.5 to \n1m below Mean Sea Level. The Kole Wetlands is one of largest, highly productive and \nthreatened wetlands in Kerala. The Kole lands are faunal rich and support a large number \nof birds including endangered and migratory birds. It also provides services such as flood \ncontrol, groundwater recharge, and acts as a carbon sink. The biodiversity in MarancherryKole wetland has been documented with the astonishing \nsupport of panchayat. The biodiversity richness of Kole wetland has been documented \nsystematically which includes 144 floral species, 21 species of mammals, 14 species of \nreptiles, 06 species of amphibians, and 244 species of birds. This was a remarkable effort \nof the panchayat for the conservation of Kole wetland area. e) Exhibition cum symposium \nAn exhibition cum symposium had been conducted to generate environmental awareness \namong the public. Many experts, teachers, stakeholders, NGOs,etc., had participated in \nthe symposium. f) Promotion of paddy cultivation /endemic species of tubers  \nPanchayat officials reported that a project for promoting paddy cultivation in 5 acres of \nland had been implemented with the support of Youth Clubs. It is expected to create a \npassion for paddy cultivation among the youths. All other supports, i.e., seeds, fertilisers, \nsubsidies, etc., have been supplied to the farmers. Furthermore, endemic species of tubers \nhave been identified, and its seeds have also been supplied to the individuals for the \npromotion of endemic tuber production. g) Nakshathravanam \nNakshathravanam (Star Forest) project aims at planting trees based on the birth star of \nthe people. Each birth star has its own tree as envisioned in the concept of Hindu religion \nand belief. State Biodiversity Board sanctioned Rs. 4.5 lakhs for the creation of \nNakshathravanam. The panchayat is planning to create Nakshathravanamnear to the \npublic crematorium. PBR \nMarancherry faced delay in preparation of PBR because of BMC was not active in the initial \nperiod. The PBR was prepared in 2018 as per the instructions of State Biodiversity Board. The \nState Bio-Diversity Board has provided training, guidance and support for the preparation of \nPBR. The grama panchayat allocated one lakh rupees for preparing PBR. The survey team \ncomprising of 2 people for each ward wasformulated. The support and participation of teachers, \nstudents and ward members was used by the survey team. It is reported that all possible \nbiological resources have been documented properly because Marancherry prepared PBR very \n \n 55 \n \n \n \nrecently. The process of preparation of PBR has been completed within one-year. A project is \nprepared now for the digitalisation of PBR. As per the PBR, 23 varieties of food grains particularly paddy have been identified. Along with \nthis, 36 varieties of vegetables, 13 tubers and 12 varieties of cash crops have also been \nidentified. Forty varieties of medicinal plants, 28 varieties of wild medicinal plants, 19 items of \nlivestock and pets and 25 wild fish wealth items have also been recorded in the PBR. There are \nexisting 80 watersheds, including streams/thodu and ponds. As far as the conservation of RET species is concerned, panchayat is planting and protecting \nmangroves. Panchayat is implementing several schemes for protecting ecosystem like wetlands, \nmangroves and kaavu. Biodiversity Clubs are functioning well in the schools. A local survey has \nbeen conducted by NGOs with the monitoring of panchayat for assessing carbon emission to \naddress the issues of climate change. Marancherry grama panchayat is a notable village in the case of natural resources like \nmangroves, canals, ponds, lake, rivers, Kole wetlands, kaavus etc. The panchayat is \nimplementing several schemes considering its ecological importance. Most of the schemes are \nimplemented through MGNREGS. Activities of MGNREGS based on the environment assets \ngenerally come under the purview of BMC. The convenor of BMC is very active in monitoring \nall the activities which have natural importance. Therefore, it can be projected as the activities of \nBMC for the protection of the environment. On the basis of such tasks of BMC which includes \nconservation of traditional water bodies, creation of new ponds and streams, biodiversity \ndocumentation of Kole wetland, planting bamboos and mangroves in the canal and lakeside, eco-\nfriendly waste management system, symposiums for environmental awareness building etc., \nMarancherry has been awarded by the State Biodiversity Board as the best BMC in 2019. 4.5 Insights from the four case studies \nTable 13:  Summary of major achievements of the grama panchayats \nSl.No \nGrama panchayat \nMajor Achievements \n1. Kanjikuzhi \n Only panchayat in Kerala that is self-sufficient in \norganic vegetable production \n Promoting livelihood opportunities through \nvegetable cultivation \n2. Eraviperoor \n Rejuvenation of Varattar river \n Conducted Eco-Gramasabha for environment \nprotection \n Promoting Eraviperoor Rice to meet the local needs \n3. Meenangadi \n Conducted carbon-neutral study to become India‘s \nfirst carbon-neutral panchayat \n  Created an artificial forest \n Conserving biodiversity spots in Kolagappara hill, \ntribal areas etc. 4. Marancherry \n Biodiversity richness of Kole wetland has been \ndocumented \n Conserving water bodies by planting bamboos and \nmangroves \nSource: Own compilation  \n \n 56 \n \n \n \n PBR is prepared in all selected grama panchayats. Eraviperoor and Kanjikkuzhi prepared \nPBR in 2011, Meenangadi in 2012 and Marancherry prepared in 2018.  The way of preparation of PBR was more or less similar in all selected panchayats in \nreliance on the guidance of the State Biodiversity Board.  The updation and digitalisation of PBR is thenext task of all BMCs. The initial works \nalready started.  All grama panchayats are keeping minutes of the meeting of BMC except Kanjikuzhi.  BMCs in all selected panchayats have been reconstituted once.  Separate office room for BMC has been seen in Meenangadigramapanchayat only.  Plastic shredding units are functioning in all selected panchayats except Kanjikuzhi for \nensuring eco-friendly waste management system. In Kanjikuzhi, Harithakeralam Mission \ncollects plastic waste for recycling purpose.  Normally there is no separate fund for the Action Plans of BMC except special funds \nfrom State Biodiversity Board for model BMCs. Such paucity of funds of BMC was \novercomeby the panchayats by integrating selected conventional projects of panchayats \nwhich are directly or indirectly related to environment assets into the Action Plan of \nBMC.  Effective use of MGNREGS is a pivotal factor for the best performance in the selected \nfour grama panchayats. Majority of the heads under MGNREGS like afforestation, water \nconservation, drought proofing, and renovation of water bodies etc., which are direct \nbenefits to the environment conservation. Therefore, MGNREGS can be considered as a \nscheme which contributes to the environment protection at the local level along with the \nemployment generation. These grama panchayats ensure the monitoring of BMCs in the \nimplementation of such projects. In other words, the majority of the activities of BMCs in \naccordance with the Action Plan have been implemented through MGNREGS.  Effective integration of various schemes, i.e., schemes of transferred institutions like \nKrishibhavan, departmental schemes, centrally sponsored schemes (MGNREGS), etc., \nhave been brought out in line with the plan formulation in selected panchayats. For \ninstance, an attempt has been made by these panchayats to enhance the paddy cultivation \nwas by using labour force of MGNREGS and seeds, fertilisers and other supports from \nKrishibhavan.  Measures of Meenangadito become India‘s first carbon-neutral panchayat and creation of \nartificial forest, efforts of Eraviperoor in the rejuvenation of Varattar river, conducting \nEco-Gramasabha and promoting Eraviperoor Rice, attempts of Marancherry in the \nconservation Kole wetland have been observed as exemplary steps in the context of \nbiodiversity conservation.  Kanjikuzhi grama panchayat is renowned for the vegetable cultivation and it has been \nobserved as a life culture of the people of Kanjikuzhi. Providing seeds and all other \nsupports to promote vegetable cultivation in all households, identifying barren land to \ncultivate vegetables by using MGNREGS labourers under the monitoring of panchayat, \nmaintaining vegetable shops to promote marketing, are the major activities of Kanjikuzhi \ngrama panchayat in this context. The attempt of Kanjhikuzhi grama panchayat to promote \nvegetable cultivation can be considered as a unique in the context of agrobiodiversity \npromotion.  Role of NGOs, stakeholders, activists, etc., is very crucial and inevitable for local \ndevelopment, particularly in environment conservation. Active involvement of such \ngroups was significant in selected grama panchayats, and it was the back born for the best \nperformance of these panchayats. 57 \n \n \n \n An approach of grama panchayats to identify NGOs, stakeholders etc., in connection with \nthe particular focussed area and to make a platform to involve them can be considered as \na foremost step in the development process. It has been witnessed in selected grama \npanchayats.  Political coordination in the development of grama panchayat has been noticed as a vital \nfactor for the best performance. 5. Potential areas for further research \nThe study has thrown up a number of possible areas for further inquiry and research. All these \nare important from the public policy point of view. Role of Local Self Government Units in promoting agrobiodiversity in their panchayat: \nThe current mode is through the formation of Biodiversity Management Committees and the \ndocumentation of biodiversity at a particular point in time through the preparation of People‘s \nBiodiversity Registers (PBRs). During our field research in four model panchayats we found that \nthis was not working at all. Most of the BMCs have been dysfunctional, and PBRs once framed \nare never updated. It must be digitised an annual auditing by an accredited agency should be \nencouraged. It is important that the state government put in place some financial incentive \nschemes for proper functioning of the BMCs. The proposed research should focus on the type \nand size of this financial incentive scheme. In this context, although the government has constituted a 13th working group on environment, \nbiodiversity and climate change with BMC as members, their role has remained merely  \nadvisory and so far  no funds have been allocated to them as well. Role of Government Research Institutes in developing knowledge for mainstreaming \nagrobiodiversity: There are a number of public research institutes in the state focusing on \nagrobiodiversity. However, they have been functioning in a vacuum, often doing research \nwithout any coordination with the Biodiversity Board. This coordination could be achieved by \nlinking these institutes to the Kerala State Biodiversity Board so that an annual research plan be \nmade and a consortium be formed to develop the requisite knowledge. Strengthening the role of the Kerala State Biodiversity Board specifically in the area of \nagrobiodiversity: The board has to be strengthened both financially and in terms of human \nresource so that it can play its coordinating role much more effectively than now. The precise \nways in which the board may be strengthened will form the focus of this research. The working \nrelations of KSBB with all the institutions in the state working on agriculture is to be \nstrengthened. The role of KSBB at the district level requires special attention. Assessing the fiscal support for agrobiodiversity management: Of the total budget allocation \nfor agriculture only a miniscule amount is allocated fir agrobiodiversity management. A higher \nallocation is to be made after making a detailed study of the budgetary requirements. Role of NGOs/CSOS in the diffusion of knowledge on agrobiodiversity: Since NGOs work \nwith local communities, they can build effective bridges between GRIs and local self-\ngovernments. The research here should focus on these specific ways in which this bridge-\nbuilding can be effected. Documenting success stories from Panchayats and BMCs: There are a limited number of \npanchayats that have been very successful. However, each of these has adopted a different \n \n 58 \n \n \n \nstrategy for maintaining agrobiodiversity. Some have taken to vegetable cultivation and linked it \nwith livelihoods; others have been focusing on the planting of different species of trees while \nstill others have been improving waterbodies and thereby the supply of water for irrigation. These stories need to be written up so that other panchayats which are laggards can learn from \nthe successful ones. Role of IPRs in promoting agrobiodiversity: A number of IPRs such as GI and Plant Varieties \nhave been issued recently. It can have two possible effects. For instance, by having different \nvarieties of rice (for instance, having a GI for Navara rice may enthuse farmers to have it \ncultivated) will certainly contribute to the maintenance of agrobiodiversity. On the contrary, \nhaving a GI tag can also result in monocropping  \nImpact of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) on agrobiodiversity:There are about 9 FTAsthat \nare in force, and threemore are in various stages of negotiation. One of the impacts of these freer \nimports of agricultural goodscan have a deleterious effect on agricultural crops and thereby on \nagrobiodiversity. However, it is also possible that such freer imports can also affect certain \nmonocrops more adversely that in its place a more diverse vegetation can spring up. The area \nunder most of the monocrops has shown a steady decline. The extent to which the BD Act in the state meet the National Biodiversity Action Plan and \nthe National Biodiversity Targets (NBTs); This is an area which requires constant monitoring \nand mid-course correction. The KSBB may be equipped to carry out this annual monitoring. It is \na kind of action research that we are suggesting. Identification of major physical threats to agrobiodiversity: It is generally recognised that \ninvasive species is one of the major threats. A regulatory mechanism for controlling the \nintroduction of invasive species as exotic flora and fauna needs to be deigned. Impact of climate change on agrobiodiversity: Extreme weather event such as severe floods \nand drought are now occurring, unfortunately rather regularly leading to a deleterious effect on \nagrobiodiversity. A study on possible ways ameliorating the negative effects of these extreme \nweather events is essential. 6. Conclusions \nIt looks that there is an awareness of the importance of protecting agrobiodiversity at the state \nlevel and also among a number of non-governmental and civil society stakeholders. However \nnone of the LSGs that we studied had any intimate knowledge of NBAP and NBTs. The state \nhas also put in place a number of legal and policy instruments aimed at protecting biodiversity in \ngeneral (which include agrobiodiversity too). There is also an organisational mechanism (Kerala \nState Biodiversity Board) to steer the agenda in this regard. The research institutes are by and \nlarge aware of the impact of their actions on biodiversity. A significant share of local \ngovernments has completed the formal requirement of preparing PBR as advocated by the \nKSBB. A few of them consider the conservation of local biodiversity as an important agenda and \ntake different steps in this direction. The other important aspect in Kerala is that a more-diverse cropping system seems to be \neconomically attractive compared to a less-diverse or mono-cropping system. This could be due \nto agro-climatic and economic conditions. The latter include the need for more labour for \nmonocropping systems, which makes it less attractive in Kerala where the cost of labour is \nhigher, and where there are possibilities of nurturing profitable multi-crop systems. This gives \ncertain economic incentives to the farmers and land-owners to sustain a relatively diverse \nfarming system, which in turn helps the conservation of agrobiodiversity. 59 \n \n \n \nHowever, there are a number of limitations or challenges too. These include: \nThough there are legal and policy instruments, there is not enough clarity on the mobilization of \nresources and mechanisms for their enforcement. Hence, some of these legal/policy provisions \nremain as wish statements. One can interpret this as an outcome of a situation where there is an \nawareness on the need to protect agrobiodiversity at the state level, but that is not translating into \nworkable strategies for its protection due to other constraints of the state government. To some extent, this is true with regard to the Kerala State Biodiversity Board too. On paper, it \nhas a number of responsibilities and if these are undertaken, can go a long way in protecting the \nbiodiversity. However, it does not have adequate financial resources and authority for this \npurpose. Kerala is yet to put in place a system of auditing all policies which can have potential negative \nimpacts on agrobiodiversity. These include the policies and programmes for the promotion of \nagriculture and plantation crops in general. However growth in area of most of the plantation \ncrops in the state has been limited by adverse market conditions. Though PBR is the main instrument and a major share of local governments has prepared it, it is \nseen as more of a task to be completed at a point of time. It is not seen as a basis for building up \nagro-biodiversity by most local governments. This may be seen as an outcome of a top-down \napproach towards conservation where the awareness at the state level has not translated to the \nlevel of local governments and communities. It can be seen that the use of PBR and other actions for the purpose of protecting agro-\nbiodiversity are notable in the case of certain local governments. The role of one or a few people \nis crucial in this regard. This shows that the success of the local-level collective action requires \nthe presence of a few well-informed and active individuals. This is not unusual considering the \nstatus of collective action which is taken to address the market failure in other domains too in \ncountries such as ours. It looks that there is an awareness of the importance of protecting agrobiodiversity at the state \nlevel and also among a number of non-governmental and civil society stakeholders. The state \nhas also put in place a number of legal and policy instruments aimed at protecting biodiversity in \ngeneral (which include agrobiodiversity too). There is also an organisational mechanism (Kerala \nState Biodiversity Board) to steer the agenda in this regard. The research institutes are by and \nlarge aware of the impact of their actions on biodiversity.A significant share of local \ngovernments has completed the formal requirement of preparing PBR as advocated by the \nKSBB. A few of them consider the conservation of local biodiversity as an important agenda and \ntake different steps in this direction. 60 \n \n \n \nReferences \nBellon, M.

As per the ref.1 cited, the undersigned submitted a proposal for the\nimplementation of the scheme ‘Organic farming and good agricultural practices’ during\n2023-24 and as per ref.2 the Government were pleased to accord administrative sanction\nfor the same for an amount of Rs. 600.00 lakh under the Head of account 2401-00-105-85\n(P). The components sanctioned for the programme include facilitating and\nassisting the farmers of the state to get their farm certified as per NPOP standards,\nextending technical support during the conversion phase, supporting SHGs and\nKrishikoottams for following the organic farming principles in production, promotion of\nGood Agricultural Practices & branding, supporting the production of organic manures,\nadditional support to biogas plants and providing facilitation, technical and extension\nsupport for the implementation of the programme. Under these circumstances, the following instructions are issued for smooth\nimplementation of the scheme and compliance at all levels.",
    "Under these circumstances, the following instructions are issued for smooth\nimplementation of the scheme and compliance at all levels. The circular has five parts –\nPart A deals with ‘organic certification programme, Part B deals with organic manure\nproduction programmes and Part C deals with additional support for Biogas units, Part D\ndeals with the additional man power support on contract basis and Part E delas with the\nGeneral Instructions for the implementation of the Scheme. PART A – ESTABLISHMENT OF CERTIFIED ORGANIC FARMS\n1. Adoption of standards for certification\n            (a). To provide a focused and well directed development of organic agriculture\nand quality products, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India launched\nthe National Programme on Organic Production (NPOP) in the year 2000, which was\nformally notified in October 2001 under the Foreign Trade & Development Act (FTDR\nAct). This document provides information on standards for organic production, systems\ncriteria & procedures for accreditation of inspection and certification bodies, the national\nADFW/4644/2023-TF2\nI/123760/2023\norganic logo and the regulations governing its use. The standards and procedures have\nbeen formulated in harmony with international standards such as those of Codex and\nIFOAM and keeping Indian requirements in mind. This updated sixth edition covers the\nmore recent issues of group certification for small / marginal farmers and mandatory\nchecks required to be carried out by the certification bodies during their inspections.",
    "A\nnumber of other improvements have also been made in the NPOP documents to meet the\nlatest international requirements. It is instructed that these standards shall be adopted for\nimplementing this scheme component under the scheme. The standards are provided\nalong with this circular as Annexure I. (b). The Additional Director (Marketing) is hereby instructed that necessary steps\nshall be taken to empanel the approved agencies for certification as per NPOP guidelines\nfor implementation of the scheme. If valid NPOP approved agencies are available in the\ncountry, they shall be invited under an EOI programme and the terms and conditions shall\nbe finalized. Usually, the organic farming certification agency has a fee structure based on\nits location or state and the fee structure is to be finalized at the Directorate level before\n15th September, 2023 and communicated to the filed level offices for implementation\nalong with the list of empaneled certification agencies. 2. Publicity of the scheme and inviting applications from the farmers\n         (a). Wide publicity of the scheme shall be done at all levels. PAOs shall ensure that\nthe information of the scheme reaches to maximum farmers. The POI, FIB is hereby\ninstructed that, sufficient publicity shall be given through all print, visual and social\nmedia. Short videos and reels are also be made out of the financial provisions already\nearmarked for them. (b).",
    "Short videos and reels are also be made out of the financial provisions already\nearmarked for them. (b). Applications from farmers are to be invited in the format as provided in the\nAnnexure II of this circular. The Agricultural Officers and AFOs shall ensure that from\namong the applicants, potential farmers for conversion in to ‘certified organic farming’\nshall only be taken for implementing the scheme. It must be born in mind that; the\ncertification programme is for a long-term tenure and withdrawal from the process during\nimplementation shall be discouraged. Note: The beneficiaries shall be selected based on the criteria of the certification\nagency and shall be the farmers who are willing to continue in the process for a longer\nperiod. (c). This scheme component is admissible to all categories of farmers ranging from\nsmall & marginal to large farmers. Farmer groups such as Krishikkoottams, vegetable\nADFW/4644/2023-TF2\nI/123760/2023\nclusters, Kudumbasree units, etc., can also be included in the programme if they are found\nsuitable for long term certification process. Farms with preponderance in crop enterprises\nshall only be selected for financial assistance under the scheme. (d).",
    "Farms with preponderance in crop enterprises\nshall only be selected for financial assistance under the scheme. (d). There are three types of organic farmers in the system such as beginners (new\nentrants), farmers in the process of certification and those who want to renew their\ncertification and it is made clear that all these categories can be supported using the\nscheme provisions. (e). Before planning for conversion in to organic farming, consider the following:\ndegree of difficulty to grow or raise the product organically, land and soil suitability,\nclimate suitability, level of demand for the product, marketing challenges, capital\nrequired, current prices for conventional, transitional and organic products, and\nprofitability over additional workload. It is suggested that perennial spice crops, some\nspecial varieties of crops unique to Kerala (like geo-tagged ones) and speciality crops are\ndesirable for implementation of the scheme. 3. The process of certification and pattern of assistance\n            (a). The AOs / AFOs shall fix the certification agency as identified as per Part A,\ninstruction 1 (b) and get a thorough understanding of the criteria they follow for\ncertification. (b). The Block Level Agricultural Knowledge Centre (BLAKC) shall be the\nconsulting agency for implementation of certification and the process of production\nshall be through proven scientific package only.",
    "Sufficient interaction of the certification\nagency with BLAKC shall be ensured for fixing the strategy for conversion of a farm in to\ncertified organic one. (c). As many State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) have stated, organic production\nsystems are knowledge based, new entrants and transitional producers must become\nfamiliar with sound and sustainable agricultural practices. Transitional producers\nshould be prepared to read appropriate information, conduct their own trials and\nparticipate in formal and informal training events. As mentioned, switching from\nconventional to organic farming is more than substituting synthetic materials to organic\nallowed materials. Organic farming is a holistic system that relies on sound practices\nfocused on preventative strategies. Since there are often few organic remedies available to\norganic producers for certain problems, prevention is the key element in organic\nproduction. The applied / selected farmers shall be made aware of the principles and\npractices underlaid in the process by the respective AOs / AFOs. ADFW/4644/2023-TF2\nI/123760/2023\n               (d). The next step is to plan the transition process. All implementing officers\nshall develop a transitional plan with clear and realistic goals. The plan should clearly\nidentify various steps to be taken in making the transition to organic and be sure to include\nrealistic timeframes. Identify the strengths and weaknesses of the farm. Consider ways to\naddress any weaknesses, while building on strengths.",
    "Identify the strengths and weaknesses of the farm. Consider ways to\naddress any weaknesses, while building on strengths. The business side of the transitional\nplan should contain a multiple year budget and an effective/realistic marketing strategy. Make sure the list of expenses is comprehensive. Include all prerequisites to begin the\ntransition; such as, mechanical weeding equipment, specialized composting equipment\nand applicators, additional handling equipment dedicated to the organic products, and\nprocessing equipment. The AOs/ AFOs are hereby directed to integrate this scheme with\nother schemes for the provision of machinery and other required inputs for profitable\norganic farming. (d). Although the demand for organic products is continually growing, growers\nneed to make sure they have a reliable market for the organic products they plan to\nproduce. Possibility of inclusion of these products in the “Keralagro” brand also shall be\nexplored. (e). As instructed earlier it is once again reiterated that, careful planning is very\nimportant. During the early part of the transitional period, yields may often depressed and\npremium prices for certified organic products may generally not yet obtainable. Use\nrealistic yields and prices when evaluating the feasibility of the plan made for the\nimplementation. (f).",
    "Use\nrealistic yields and prices when evaluating the feasibility of the plan made for the\nimplementation. (f). In some instances, it is preferable to continue using conventional measures\nearly on in the transitional process in order to avoid dramatic yield reduction which\ncould jeopardize the financial well-being of the operation. For example, farmers who are\nplanning to convert their livestock operation should consider certifying their fields first. This allows time to learn more about organic livestock management requirements while,\nat the same time, starting to produce organic feeds. (g). Although organic certifiers generally want to see the entire farm become\norganic, certifiers usually allow new entrants several years of transition time before the\nwhole farm is fully certified. The implementing officers shall clarify it with the\ncertification agencies and facilitate the farmers accordingly. (h). Parallel production is the simultaneous production, processing or handling of\norganic and nonorganic crops, livestock and other products of a similar nature. Although\nthis type of activity is highly discouraged by certifiers, some allow it, especially during\nthe transition period. If permitted to practice parallel production, producers must be\nADFW/4644/2023-TF2\nI/123760/2023\nprepared to deal with significant record keeping in order to ensure traceability and organic\nintegrity.

    "(i). Since soil is the heart of the organic farming system, it is crucial that new\nentrants understand the various characteristics and limitations of the soils found on their\nfarm. Soil suitability may vary significantly from one field to the next. Fields with good\ndrainage, good level of fertility and organic matter, adequate pH, biological health, high\nlegume content, and with less weed and pest pressure, are excellent assets. Often these\nfields are the first ones ready for transition and certification. Field yield histories are very\nimportant and should be considered early in the transition. Unhealthy soils require\nparticular attention. (j). The AOs / AFOs shall facilitate the beneficiary farmers to follow crop\nrotation(s) and select the most suitable cover crops (green manure, winter cover crops,\ncatch crops, smother crops, etc.). Crop rotations are extremely important management\ntools in organic farming. It must be noted that they can interrupt pest life cycles, suppress\nweeds, provide and recycle fertility, and improve soil structure and tilth. Some rotational\ncrops may also be cash crops, generating supplemental income. Crop diversification may\nalso be adopted as a strategy for raising the income of the farmers and assuring resilience.

    "Crop diversification may\nalso be adopted as a strategy for raising the income of the farmers and assuring resilience. (k). If farmers plan to grow crops without raising any livestock or with less extent\nof integration, it may be necessary for them to source allowable soil amendments such as\ncomposted manure, limestone, rock dust, and supplementary sources of nitrogen,\nphosphorus, potassium and micro-nutrients. They shall be supported with adequate\nmanure production programmes and green / green leaf manures for the scientific fertility\nmanagement of the farm. Sufficient awareness shall be given to the beneficiaries\nregarding the use of bio-fertilisers in this regard by the field level implementing officers. (l). The AOs / AFOs shall assure that under organic production, farmers must be\nable to recycle nutrients through proper nutrient management practices: recycling\nthrough good manure and compost utilization, crop rotations, cover crops (green manure,\ncatch, and nitrogen fixing crops), and by reducing nutrient losses due to leaching, over-\nfertilization, as well as poor manure and compost management (storage, handling, and\nspreading). (m). It is important to know the crop’s most common pests (includes disease\nand weeds also), their life cycles and adequate control measures.",
    "There are several\nmeasures available to reduce pest pressure: crop rotation, variety selection, sanitation,\nfloating row covers, catch crops, flamers, introduction of beneficial insects, bio pesticides,\nand inorganic pesticides. Transitional growers should be prepared to use and experiment\nADFW/4644/2023-TF2\nI/123760/2023\nwith some of these options. The other schemes of the Department such as ‘Soil & Root\nHealth Management and Crop Health Management’ shall be integrated for achieving good\nresults in this regard. Availability of organic molecules has improved significantly over\nthe past few years. New pest control products containing B.t., Spinosad, Kaolin clay are\neffective and currently available to organic growers. (n). Record keeping is one of the most important requirements to maintain\norganic integrity. Farmers are expected to keep detailed production, processing and\nmarketing information. This information includes everything that enters and exits the\nfarm. Third party, independent inspectors require farmers to present the above-mentioned\ndocumentation when inspecting the farm operation. Once the record-keeping\nrequirements are understood and the reporting procedure established, paperwork becomes\nroutine. The AOs / AFOs shall facilitate the farmers in this regard. (o).
