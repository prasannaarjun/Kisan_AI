PREFACE 
 
As an emerging professional requirement, a manual that can understand the 
need and regulate practices based on which an organization can operate is becoming 
critical and of great value. Over and above, the Public Accounts Committee of Kerala 
Legislative Assembly emphasised the requirement of such a manual for the 
department and that was a strong motivation to prepare this manual. 
This manual is intended to be a dynamic document that provides detailed 
insights into administrative, legal and technical topics. More specifically, the manual 
describes administrative, technical and legal aspects to be followed by professionals, 
officers and other staff in office administration and scheme implementation in a 
streamlined and accessible way. Several chapters/sections may remain static for long 
periods whereas some others are likely to be expanded/updated on a regular basis, to 
include additional information. 
It is anticipated that various units of government and local self-government 
would use the information to guide the officers. If adopted for reference in a 
regulatory programme viz; in seed production and fertilizer/ insecticide control by an 
officer, the contents of the manual have the strength of law behind it. No individual 
section of this manual will contain all the guidance or material necessary to fully 
assist the officials. Other references or orders from Government that supplement this 
Manual shall be utilized if appropriate.  
The purpose of preparing this document is to provide fundamental   and   step- 
by - step process for the guidance of the professionals, officers and staff who are the 
target users of this Manual.

ORGANIZATION AND CONSTITUTION OF THE DEPARTMENT 
 
 
Section 2: Introduction 
 
 
 
The State has witnessed a remarkable transformation in the agricultural sector 
since its formation. The implementation of Land Reforms Act in 1963 became the 
knell of feudalism and it became the landmark in Kerala's agricultural sector and a 
stepping-stone for further reforms in this field. Cash crops like coconut, rubber, tea, 
coffee, pepper, cardamom, arecanut, ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon etc. and food crops 
paddy, vegetables, tapioca, other tubers, etc. give the agricultural sector of Kerala a 
distinct flavour. The agro climatic conditions in Kerala suit the cultivation of a variety 
of seasonal and perennial crops.  
The Department of Agriculture Development and Farmers’ Welfare formerly 
Department of Agriculture being one of the prominent developmental departments is 
continuously engaged in the service of the farming community. The improved 
technical know-how and research results/technologies emanating from various 
sources are being implemented to obtain increased production by adoption of 
improved technologies. The department is mainly committed to the agricultural 
extension, development and implementation of schemes/ programmes to increase the 
production of food crops and cash crops in the state. 
1.2.1. History of the department 
 
The department started functioning/formed during the reign of H.H. Shree 
Moolam Thirunal, then Maharaja of Travancore on 27th May 1908.               
Dr. N. Kunjanpillai, was appointed as the first Director of Agriculture. The 
agriculture demonstration farms in Trivandrum and Kollam and Animal Husbandry 
4 
sector were under his supervision. Later more farms, laboratories and cattle breeding 
stations were established. At that time, the Department of Agriculture was functioning 
as a part of Land Revenue Department. In 1924, the staff pattern of one Agriculture 
Inspector and two Field Assistants in every taluk and one officer at district level were 
implemented.  
During 1956, when Kerala State was formed uniting Thirukochi and Malabar 
regions, Shri. C. Achutha Menon, then Finance Minister was holding charge of 
Agriculture also and the renowned agriculture technocrat, Shri. P. D. Nair became the 
first Director of Agriculture for Kerala State. The College of Agriculture, Vellayani 
started functioning in 1955 and continued under the Agricultural department till 1972. 
Consequent on the formation of 144 N.E.S. blocks in 1962, the activities of 
agriculture department were carried out as a part of the Block Development Offices 
and one Agricultural Development Officer was appointed in each block. The Ela 
Development Offices for rice development, Coconut Package Units for coconut 
development,Pepper Package Units for spice development, etc., came into existence 
during 1970s under the control of District Agricultural Officers and later the District 
Agricultural Office was renamed as Principal Agriculture Offices. 
In 1977, Special Agricultural Development Units (SADU) for the 
implementation of Kerala Agricultural Development Project (KADP) were 
established. Under this, unit level activities were carried out by one Junior 
Agricultural Officer and two Agricultural Demonstrators. 
In 1981, Sub Divisional Agriculture Offices headed by Sub Divisional 
Agricultural Officer in the cadre of Deputy Director of Agriculture and assisted by 
Subject Matter Specialists (SMS) in the cadre of Assistant Director of Agriculture 
were established as part of Kerala Agricultural Extension Project (KAEP), aiming at 
agricultural development and extension activities through Training & Visit (T&V) 
system. 
The department of agriculture was reorganized with Krishi Bhavans in all 
Panchayats/ Municipalities/ Municipal Corporations as the base level units for 
5 
agricultural extension and development with proper administrative and technical 
support at sub divisional, district and state levels with effect from 1st September 1987 
as per the GO (Ms.) No. 188/87/AD, Dt.17/08/1987. The Krishi Bhavans were 
established with the prime objective of maximising the production and productivity 
by ensuring the timely availability of production inputs and integrated services at 
grassroots level. In the reorganised set up, the Sub Divisional Agriculture Offices 
assumed the responsibility for guiding and supervising all the Krishi Bhavans in each 
subdivision. Accordingly, each Subject Matter Specialist (SMS) in the cadre of 
Assistant Director of Agriculture in subdivision was put in charge of all the Krishi 
Bhavans within the jurisdiction of one block area over and above the duties and 
responsibilities as SMS under Kerala Agricultural Extension Project in the 
subdivisions.  
In 1988, the Government have ordered further administrative arrangement for 
the efficient functioning of the department as per the GO (Ms.) No.3/88/AD, 
Dtd.07/01/1988. Accordingly, the Assistant Directors of Agriculture (SMS) were 
taken out of the Sub Divisional Agriculture Offices and accommodated within their 
area of operation (block) itself and thus the O/o Assistant Director of Agriculture 
were formed in each block. 
In 1989, the non-gazetted Agricultural Officers in Krishi Bhavans were 
authorised for  drawing and disbursing the bills in respect of their pay, allowances 
and GPF advances including those of their subordinates in their establishments as per 
GO (Rt.) No.173/89/Fin, Dtd.11/01/1989. 
Later, the Sub Divisional Agriculture Offices were discontinued since 1994 
and the Sub Divisional Agricultural Officers in the cadre of Deputy Director of 
Agriculture were deployed and attached to district level Principal Agriculture Offices. 
At present, the department have a Directorate at state level, Principal Agriculture 
Offices in all districts, O/o Assistant Directors of Agriculture in all blocks and Krishi 
Bhavans in all Panchayats/ Municipalities/ Municipal Corporations. In order to carry 
out/ provide some specific services to the farming community, certain other

institutions are also functioning under the department, which include Farm 
Information Bureau, Kerala Centre for Pest Management, O/o the Assistant Executive 
Engineer, State Pesticide Testing Laboratory, Fertilizer Quality Control Laboratories,

Chapter II 
 
 OFFICE ADMINISTRATION 
 
Section 3. Disciplinary Proceedings and Procedure 
 
It is essential to ensure discipline among the employees for the smooth 
functioning of a department for that, the Kerala Civil Services (Classification, Control 
and appeal) Rules in 1960 came in to existence. The departmental proceedings against 
a Government servant has to go through the following important steps. 
(1) Lodging of a complaint:  
The departmental proceedings against a Government servant starts with the 
lodging of a complaint with the disciplinary authority. On the receipt of a complaint, 
it is open to the disciplinary authority to hold preliminary inquiry to ascertain the 
prima facie truth in the allegations. The complaint may be made by an ordinary citizen 
or superior officer of the employee. 
(2) Holding of Preliminary Enquiry: - 
 The main purpose of preliminary inquiry is to determine whether or not there is 
a prima facie case against the official for proceeding further against him/her. The 
preliminary inquiry is conducted by the officer superior to the delinquent on the 
directions of the disciplinary authority so that disciplinary authority comes to the 
conclusion that as to whether or not it is necessary to hold a regular departmental 
inquiry.  
Since it is not necessary to hold preliminary inquiry before initiation of regular 
departmental inquiry, however, it would be desirable to hold such an enquiry in the 
following cases:- 
i) Where it is not immediately known as to who was responsible for a particular act 
or loss;  
126 
ii) Where it is considered desirable before initiating departmental proceedings to have 
prima facie evidence against the official concerned; 
iii) Where the allegations are vague or indefinite and it is necessary to find out all the 
acts of commission or omission to form the basis of the charges 
 (3) Report of the Preliminary inquiry:  
After the conclusion of preliminary inquiry, a brief record of the proceedings 
should be prepared in writing. The inquiry should conclude into a report which should 
contain the findings as to whether there seems to be some substance in all or some of 
the allegations and to what extent a particular employee is responsible. After 
examining the report, the disciplinary authority should decide as to whether a prima 
facie case exists for the initiation of regular departmental inquiry or not.  
(4) Show Cause Notice:  
When a Govt. official is held prima facie responsible for misconduct in the 
preliminary inquiry report, then show cause notice is issued by the disciplinary 
authority asking him to submit his reply as to why further proceedings be not initiated 
against him. In the show cause notice the delinquent is required to be informed that 
he is prima facie held responsible for the professional misconduct/lapse. 
(5) Reply to the Show cause notice:  
Thereafter the delinquent held prima facie responsible for misconduct, is 
required to submit his reply to the show cause notice within stipulated period 
prescribed in the show cause notice. If the delinquent failed to submit his reply within 
the prescribed period, then the disciplinary authority is empowered to move further 
into the matter ex-parte or reminder may be issued to the delinquent to submit his 
reply. 
(6) Charge-Sheet:  
If the reply to the show cause notice is considered as unsatisfactory by the 
disciplinary authority, then formal departmental proceedings are initiated against the 
Government servant starting from issuing charge-sheet to him. The grounds on which 
it is proposed to initiate the formal departmental proceedings should be reduced to 
127 
the form of definite charge or charges. The charges should be communicated in 
writing to the delinquent in the form of a charge sheet. It refers to the written and 
formal intimation to the delinquent, about the alleged misconduct so that he has full 
knowledge of the acts or conduct, he is accused of. It is a document containing the 
allegations of misconduct, called the ''Charge", levelled against the employee 
concerned. There is no specific or prescribed form in for issuing the charge-sheet. 
Generally, it is in the form of a letter or notice.  
i. Requisites of a Valid Charge:  
In a disciplinary proceedings, the charge sheet is very important. It should be 
framed with great care and competence. A faulty charge-sheet may invalidate the 
whole proceedings. The requisites of a valid charge or charge sheet are the following: 
(a) The Charge should not be vague:- The charge must be specific, particular and 
precise. The vagueness of a charge vitiates the inquiry proceedings. It is not easy to 
define the term vagueness. If the ground is incapable of being understood nor defined 
with sufficient certainty, it can be called vague. It would be vague if it does not give 
any indication of charges against the employee.  
(b) The language of the charge - sheet should be simple and impartial:- The 
language of the charge-sheet should be simple and clearly understandable to the 
employee.  
(c) The charge should give full details of the incident: - All the material relating to 
the charges must be brought along with the charge-sheet. The delinquent employee 
should be provided with all material relating to the charges to give him a reasonable 
opportunity 
to 
defend 
himself, 
examine 
and 
cross-examine 
witnesses. 
(d) The charge-sheet should contain a statement of allegations on which each charge 
is based.  
(e) The charge should be based either on breach of the conduct rules framed 
from time to time or on good and sufficient reason:- It is for the disciplinary authority 
to decide as to what constitutes good and sufficient reason.  
128 
 
(g) The manner of writing the charge-sheet should not be such as to indicate pre-
judged conclusion of the guilt which might make the whole inquiry proceedings an 
empty formality:- If there is an actuated motive of the employer to punish and it is 
ostensible or smelled from the charge-sheet, it is malafides and is liable to be quashed.  
(h)The concerned employee must be given a reasonably sufficient time to 
explain the charges. 
(i) To ensure that the delinquent is given an opportunity to give an explanation 
to defend himself. It is obligatory on the part of the disciplinary authority to furnish 
the delinquent not only with a copy of charge-sheet but also the grounds on which 
those charges were based and the circumstances in which it was proposed to take 
action against him. 
(j) Service of charge-sheet:- The charge-sheet should be served within a reasonable 
time. However mere delay in serving the charge-sheet would not invalidate the 
inquiry proceedings unless the same has resulted in prejudice to the delinquent.  
 (7) Reply of the delinquent to the Charge-sheet:  
The delinquent has to submit his written reply to the charge-sheet within the 
time specified, unless it is extended by the competent authority. Failure of the 
delinquent to submit his explanation would enable the authority to proceed exparte.  
(8) Scrutiny of the reply of the delinquent by the disciplinary authority:  
The scrutiny of the reply of the delinquent has to be done by the disciplinary 
authority with utmost care. If the delinquent admits the charges or any of the charges 
and asks for mercy, no inquiry needs to be held in respect of such charges so admitted. 
If the explanation of the delinquent is found to be satisfactory and if the authority 
decides to exonerate the delinquent and not to award any penalty, the proceedings 
should be dropped.  
If in the opinion of the disciplinary authority, the imposition of a major penalty 
is not warranted and that it would meet the ends of justice if some minor penalty is 
awarded, the straight away an order awarding such minor penalty be passed. If, after 
129 
considering the explanation, the punishing authority decides that the delinquent 
deserves the imposition of a major penalty, then an inquiry officer should be 
appointed to hold a regular departmental inquiry. 
The charges, in respect to which the explanation is found to be satisfactory, 
should be dropped. In respect to the rest and then, in that case, no further inquiry or 
show cause notice would be necessary.  
 (9) Appointment of Inquiry Officer and nomination of Presenting Officer:  
If the reply of the delinquent official is considered unsatisfactory by the 
disciplinary authority, then Inquiry Officer is appointed to conduct regular 
departmental inquiry. 
 (10) Findings and Report of the Inquiry Officer:  
After the conclusion of the Inquiry, the Inquiry Officer shall draw up a report 
which generally consists of the following:- 
(a) A brief Introduction leading to the appointment of the Inquiry, Inquiry 
Officer and the dates of hearing. 
(b) A statement of charges and allegations against the delinquent. 
(c) The explanation of the delinquent. 
(d) The oral and documentary evidence produced in support of the charges. 
(e) The evidence led by and on behalf of the delinquent.  
(f) Reason for acceptance or rejection by the Inquiry Officer, of evidence led  
     by either party. 
(g) Conclusions arrived at with respect to each of the charges. 
 
The inquiry officer should give clear findings on each of the charges, so that 
the delinquent should know, on what grounds he has been found guilty. The findings 
of the inquiry officer are in the nature of a report to the disciplinary authority to enable 
him to pass final orders. These are merely to assist the authority and are not binding 
on the disciplinary authority. In no case, the inquiry officer should recommend or 
propose any penalty. 
130 
 
 
(11) Findings of the disciplinary Authority and issuance of Show Cause Notice 
to delinquent:  
 
The report of the Inquiry Officer is merely an enabling document which helps 
the disciplinary authority in formulating his opinion and to come to a conclusion 
about the guilt of the delinquent. If the disciplinary authority is of the opinion that the 
charges against the delinquent have not been proved and that the delinquent should 
be exonerated, it will pass an order to that effect and communicate it to the 
government servant concerned.  
If the charges against the delinquent stand proved, then disciplinary authority 
issues a Show Cause Notice to the delinquent proposing the penalty prescribed under 
the rules. The Show Cause Notice is given with the object to afford to the delinquent 
a reasonable opportunity to reply to the penalty proposed. It must specify the charges 
and allegations and should also disclose the reasons for coming to the conclusions.  
(12) Submission of reply to the Show Cause Notice and consideration of his past 
records:  
 
The delinquent is required to submit his reply to the Show Cause Notice within 
stipulated period. Where the delinquent makes a request for a personal hearing, it 
must be given to him. Its denial might vitiate any action taken against him. Further, 
The disciplinary authority is free to consider the past service record of the delinquent 
while imposing penalty. 
(13) Penalty Proposed:  
Depending upon the gravity of the misconduct committed by the employee, the 
disciplinary authority is to decide the kind of penalty to be imposed on him. The Rules 
enumerate the following two kinds of penalties:- 
(a) Minor Penalties:- (i) Censure (ii) Withholding of promotion (iii) Recovery from 
pay (iv) Withholding of increment of pay, without cumulative effect. 
131 
(b) Major Penalties:- (i) Reduction to a lower stage in the time-scale of pay for a 
specified period, which shall ordinarily be not a bar to promotion.(ii) Reduction to a 
lower time-scale of pay, grade, post or service, which shall ordinarily be a bar to the 
promotion (iii) Compulsory retirement; (iv) Removal from service and (v) Dismissal 
from service. 
(14) Final order:  
After following the above mentioned procedure, finally order for imposing 
penalty is passed by the disciplinary authority. Since the disciplinary proceedings 
under the Service Rules, are quasi-judicial in nature and as such, it is necessary that 
the order in such proceedings issued by the disciplinary should have the attributes of 
judicial order. It should be a self-contained and reasoned order conforming to the 
legal requirements.  
The reasons reveal a rational nexus between the facts considered and the 
conclusions reached. It also enables the delinquent to make his case for going in 
appeal or revision before a higher administrative authority or for invoking the 
jurisdiction of the High Court, against the decision of the disciplinary authority. 
17) Remedies against Imposition of Penalties:  
A government servant being not satisfied with the decision of the disciplinary 
authority has the following remedies against the order passed against him/her; 
(A) Constitutional remedies: -  
A government employee, is entitled to protection under the Constitution of 
India. Therefore, if any action taken against him is in violation of his Constitutional 
rights, he may invoke the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 32 and 
the 
High 
Courts 
under 
Article 
226 
of 
the 
Constitution 
of 
India.  
(B) Administrative Remedies:- 
(i) Appeal: -The right of appeal is one of the basic rights and defence of the 
delinquent employee. A government servant may prefer an appeal to the 
appellate authority specified in this behalf, under the Rules regulating his 
service. An appeal shall generally be preferred within a period of 45 days from 
132 
the date of delivery of the order to the employee. 
(ii) Revision: - When, after the appellate authority has passed its judgment and 
if the government servant is not satisfied with it, he may file revision with the 
authority, 
as 
prescribed 
by 
service 
rules.  
(iii) Review: - Right of review is not a right of appeal, where all questions 
decided are open to challenge. In the absence of any specific provision 
authorizing the authority to review an order passed in disciplinary proceedings, 
it is not permissible for an authority to review the order

It can also be adopted for use in the regional, district or sub-offices of Department 
with suitable changes if necessary. The important aspects of file management as per 
manual of office procedure is summarized below; 
 
3.1.3. Tappals

opened on the next day along with the tappal of that day. Tapal is opened in the 
presence of the head of office or authorized officer. The officer can make necessary 
instructions at that time on Tapal. 
The tapal is then date sealed, numbered and sorted section wise and entered in 
the distribution register (DR) by the tapal clerk. Then it is sent to the Section 
Superintendent for distribution to the concerned section clerks along with the

3.1.4. Personal Register: 
 
All the Communications received in the office which are distributed to the 
sections (Currents) to be acknowledged in the DR are registered in the Personal 
Register.  
3.1.5. Referencing:  
 
Referencing is a process of putting up in a case previous correspondence, rules, 
reports etc. required for its disposal, flagging them and indicating the fact in the 
margin of note file/current file/draft in which they are mentioned or quoted.  
Every paper quoted by its number and date in the current file should be put up. 
If it is in the current file, the page number may be indicated in pencil in the margin. 
If it is in a disposed file, it may be obtained from records and flagged and the relevant 
para and page number indicated in margin.  
For every statement made in the note file, an authority must be quoted. If it is 
in the current file, the page number may be quoted in the body of the note at the end 
of each sentence in brackets in pencil. If it is in a dis file, the old disposal is flagged 
and the disposal number, relevant page and para noted in the note file and its flag 
letter noted in pencil in the margin.  
3.1.6. Flagging:  
 
Every disposal file mentioned in the current file or note file to which a reference is 
made in the file, should be put up for reference with flags attached to the docket. Flags 
136 
should not be pinned to any page of the current file/note file. When there are more 
than one disposal for reference, flags should be attached in alphabetical order. There 
must be only one flag on a disposal. If there is more than one disposal, one flag should 
not cover another. Flags bearing the same letter should not again be attached to the 
disposals put up for reference in a file.  
3.1.7. Linking of files:  
 
Linking of files becomes necessary when a reference is made in a file to a paper 
or notes or orders in another pending file. The two files are then linked and attention 
invited to the concerned pages of the linked file. The principal file is kept above but 
its strings are tied below and the file referred to, is kept below and with its strings the 
two files are tied. The papers in the two files should remain unchanged. Files should 
not be linked unnecessarily. Linking should be made only if it is absolutely necessary 
for disposing of the case. If possible, extracts from the other files can be taken and 
put up to avoid linking of files. If the two files contain similar issues, the two files 
can be combined into one.  
3.1.8. Note file and Current file:  
A case or file consists of a note file, current file and put up papers, if any. The 
note file and current file are kept separate till disposal of the case. The current file is 
tagged to a blue fly leaf and consists of communications received and references 
issued. The Note file is separate and tagged to a yellow fly leaf and is written to 
facilitate the disposal of the case. A note is continued till a final decision is taken in 
the case.  
3.1.9. Noting:  
 
The aim of a note is to present the facts in the most intelligible, condensed and 
convenient form so that the decision taking authority may take a quick and correct 
decision. Past history of the case, precedents, if any etc. are to be mentioned in the 
note. Rules and regulations and standing orders relating to the case should be quoted 
and discussed briefly. All materials should be analysed and the pros and cons of the 
matter discussed properly. There is no necessity to reproduce the matter contained in 
137 
the current file, but the deficiencies and omissions should be supplied in the note. It 
should be as brief as possible. For ready reference, back files, extracts of rules and 
regulations or reference books should also be put up along with the file with proper 
referencing. Note must run continuously. Precis of contents of the current file can be 
written where the communication is too lengthy. The clerks and superintendents are 
not expected to give any opinion or suggestions. In simple cases, a draft can also be 
put up along with a note.  
3.1.9.1. Method of Noting:  
 
Notes will be written in foolscap size sheets with 1/3 margin. On the top will 
be written the subject in red ink. The file number will be noted on the top left corner. 
Note sheets will be tagged to a yellow fly leaf. Pages on both sides and paragraphs 
will be given numbers. When a reference is issued, that fact will be indicated in square 
brackets underlined by red ink in the note. Similarly, receipt of communications will 
also be noted in square brackets in the note file. Officer's queries in the current file 
will be copied in the note file and answered in the note file. When drafts are put up 
for approval that fact should be indicated in the note file. Note file will be separate 
from the current file till its disposal. Note file will be placed above the current file 
always. While submitting the file to officers, blank sheets should be added to the note 
file. Handwriting should be legible and tidy. A note should not end at the very end of 
a page. Below each completed note the clerk or superintendent who prepared it, 
should put his initials and date, in the left hand side.  
3.1.10. Drafting:  
Drafts are written in separate sheets. Long drafts must be typed. Sufficient 
space should be left for making corrections. They are placed above the current file 
and below the note file. At the head of every draft it should be noted whether it is a 
letter, memorandum or D.O. etc. In draft letters, the name, designation of the 
addressee will come above while in the proceedings, memorandum etc. the list of 
addressees will be given at the bottom of the draft. Draft should not contain 
information more than what is necessary. The matter in the draft should not drag 
138 
government/HOD into controversies. Draft must be complete and brief. As far as 
possible enclosures should be minimised. Self-contained drafts are always good. 
They should be written in polite but effective language which can convey the spirit 
of the decision taken in the office. Amount indicated in drafts should be written in 
words also; piecemeal correspondence should be avoided.

v. R.Dis – Very important papers, such as decisions of Government or the Director 
affecting the whole department or unit which will be required for future reference and 
142 
records are to be retained permanently under general or special orders governing the 
retention on the records, will be recorded and assigned “R.Dis”.  
3.1.15. Indexing:  
 
The object of indexing is to enable one to trace papers containing orders passed 
on any particular subject. Index slips on all important orders passed from a Dept. are 
consolidated annually and typed or printed for perusal of the officer and reference by 
office. This helps office to put up for reference orders of similar nature issued earlier 
and thus helps to bring continuity and consistency in Government administration. A 
list of standard heads are given in the MOP. The index contains Head, Sub Head and 
Title. The head is selected from the approved list. The head must be a word that will 
naturally occur to anyone who wants the paper. Consistency is essential in the 
selection of index heads. Even if the heads are badly chosen, so long as there is 
consistency, there is no harm. After the Head and Sub Head comes local classification 
and then title. Brevity is the merit of a title. If the title gives the message at a sight 
like press headlines, the title is good. Papers relating to officers should be indexed 
under the name of the officer concerned.  
Eg: Estt – Fisheries Department – Promotion and Transfer – Senior Clerk – Orders 
issued.  
3.1.16. Checks on delays in Office: 
 
It is the duty of the Head of Office, Section head, Controlling Officer to check 
delays in the transaction of business in their offices. Their responsibility to check 
delays are two-fold: (1) to ensure proper processing of papers already in the section 
(2) to ensure that reports called for from subordinate offices are not delayed. They 
must periodically inspect PRs of Clerks, call book, register of periodicals, stock file, 
etc.  
3.1.17. Inspection of Personal Register:  
 
Inspection of personal register is an effective mechanism for checking delay 
and arrears. The HOD must prescribe a schedule for inspection of PRs by the Officers. 
143 
Section head must inspect the PR every month. The Inspecting Officer must see that 
papers are submitted by the clerk within 5 days of receipt. The PR should be 
accompanied by a running note for inspection. The queries or remarks made based on 
the inspection must be answered immediately and registers resubmitted.  
3.1.18. Call Book:  
 
When action in a file for a conceivable time, say 3 months to 6, is not active, 
then such entries are closed in the PR and they are entered in the call book to be 
opened on a specified date or earlier. There should be only one common CB for a 
section. The reopening of files to be ensured by the Inspecting Officers.  
6.1.19. Reminder Diary:  
 
The RD is primarily intended to remind initiation of further action in any file 
on a specified future date. The clerk’s first duty on each working day is to examine 
the entries in his RD against that date. 
 3.1.20. Periodical Register:  
 
The periodical registers should be maintained in sections receiving as well as 
issuing periodical returns to watch their punctual receipt and dispatch. Each clerk will 
maintain a Register. Every periodical due is assigned a number in the list of 
periodicals. Where an out-going periodical, is compiled from or is identical with an 
incoming periodical, the same number will be assigned to both the outgoing and 
incoming ones, the only entry required being the number of periodicals and the date 
of receipt or dispatch or both. The register will be written at the beginning of the 
calendar year so far as columns (1) to (2), (6) and (7) are concerned. Where a 
periodical is due from more than one officer, each officer from whom it is due should 
be entered on a separate line in column (3). All correspondence arising in connection 
with a periodical should not be brought to the Personal Registers unless it is 
important. Full use should be made of the Periodical Register for this purpose the last 
column of which provides for the entry of any other routine correspondence, such as 
reminder, etc. The Periodical Register should be inspected by the head of the 
144 
ministerial staff or the head of office according to a schedule drawn up by the head 
of office. If an officer has no particulars to be furnished in respect of any return a “Nil 
Statement” should be sent. A specimen copy of the Periodical Register is given

3.1.21. Lie over cases: 
  
Cases which are ordered by the Head of Office to be kept in abeyance for a 
definite period, say not exceeding 3 months is known as Lie over cases. This type of 
cases should also be noted in the Reminder diary, so that action can be taken at the 
appropriate time. 
 3.1.22. Stock File:  
Permanent files of important orders should be maintained for reference and 
should be carefully kept up to date. Each stock file will have a table of contents 
prefixed to it giving the number and date of each paper filed, its title and its page in 
the file for easy reference.  
3.1.23. Monthly Business Statement:  
 
The monthly business statement (arrear list) is intended to bring to the notice 
of superior officers the slackness in disposal or accumulation of arrears. This is taken 
as a reflection of the transaction of business in the section. Before 5th of every month 
each section has to prepare its monthly business statement.

FUNCTIONING OF AN INSTITUTION/OFFICE 
 
Section: 2. Accounts 
 
3.2.1. Some Account Terms  
1. Average monthly pay under Kerala Service Rules means, the average monthly 
pay earned during the ten complete months preceding the month in which the 
leave commences. 
2. Budget estimates are the detailed estimates of the annual receipts and 
disbursement   of the budget year.  Budget year means the financial year 
commencing on the Ist April and ending with 31 st March from which the budget 
is prepared.   
3. Cadre means the strength of a service or part of a service sanctioned as a 
separate unit.   
4. Day means a calendar day beginning and ending midnight. But an absence 
from headquarters which does not exceed 24 hours shall be reckoned for all 
purposes as one day at whatever hours the absence begin or ends.   
5. Fee means a recurring or non-recurring payment to a Government servant from 
a source other than general revenues whether made directly to the Government 
servant or indirectly through the intermediary of government  but does not 
include  
(a) Unearned income such as income from property, dividends and interests on 
securities and  
(b) Income from literary, cultural or artistic efforts if such efforts are not aided 
by the knowledge acquired by the officer in his service.   
7. Foreign Service means service in which a Government servant receives his 
substantive pay with the sanction of government from any source other than the 
revenue of India or of a State  
146 
8. Honorarium means a recurring or non-recurring payment granted to a Government 
servant from the general revenues as remuneration of special work of an occasional 
or intermittent character.  
9. Lien means the title of a Government servant to hold substantively, either 
immediately or on termination of a period or periods of absence, a permanent post 
including a tenure post to which he has been appointed substantively. 
10. Month means a calendar month.  In calculating a period expressed in terms of 
months and days complete calendar months irrespective of the number of days 
calculated subsequently, each should first be calculated and the odd number of days 
calculated subsequently.  Note: For purposes of pension, a month should be reckoned 
as 30 days irrespective of the number of days in a month.   
11. Ministerial staff means a government servant of a subordinate service whose 
duties are entirely clerical and any other class of servants specially defined as such 
by general or special orders of Government. Eg; An Accountant or a clerk is a 
ministerial officer but an agricultural assistant/ scientific assistant attached to a Krishi 
bhavan/laboratory is not a ministerial officer.   
12. Permanent post means a post carrying definite rate of pay sanctioned without limit 
of time.  
13. Personal pay means an additional pay granted to a Government Servant. 
(a) To save him from a loss of substantive pay in respect of a permanent post

substantive pay otherwise than as disciplinary measure; 
Or  
(b) In exceptional circumstances or other personal consideration. 
14. Public conveyance means a train or other conveyance which plies regularly for 
the conveyance of passengers, such as motor boats, buses etc. 
147 
15. Re-appropriation means the transfer of savings for the appropriation for a unit of 
appropriation to meet excess expenditure anticipated under another unit.  
3.2.2. Receipts –Collection and Check  
1. Every Government servant who is entrusted with the duty of collecting any 
revenue due to the Government should assess the demands carefully and collect 
the revenue promptly.  He should maintain proper account of the collections, 
watch the progress of collections against the total demand and take prompt steps 
to collect all arrears, if, in spite of taking all possible steps, some arrears still 
remain uncollected and he is satisfied that any portion of them is quite 
irrecoverable, he should apply at once to the competent authority for sanction to 
write off the irrecoverable arrears.  These principles apply equally to the recovery 
of loans and advances made by the Government.  
2. Officers of the Government receiving money on behalf of Government must give 
the payer the receipt in form T.R5.  They should keep a complete account of the 
receipt books that they have received and should be able to produce them always 
used or unused.  The books should be carefully examined to see that the number 
of forms contained in each is intact and a certificate of count recorded on the 
flyleaf.  Ordinarily more than one book should not be used at one and the same 
time, and the new book should be brought into use only after the old one is 
exhausted.  The stock register of receipt book should show the dates on which the 
book was brought to use and the date on which it was completed.  Counterfoils 
of used receipt books should be kept under lock and key in the personal custody 
of the head of office.  
3.  No stamped receipts need be given by Government servants for amounts 
received by or on behalf of Government even for sums exceeding Rs. 5000/- to 
be remitted into Government Account.  
4. The controlling officers should issue necessary instructions to their subordinates 
regarding the correct heads of accounts to which the different classes of receipts 
should be credited into the treasury.  
148 
5. Every Government servant who is responsible for the collection of any money 
due to the Government should see that demands are made at once as payments 
become due, that effective steps are taken to ensure the prompt realization of all 
amounts due and that proper records are kept to show in respect of all items of 
revenue, whether recurring or non-recurring, the assessment and demands made, 
the progress of recovery and the outstanding amounts due to the Government.  
Every departmental controlling officer should watch closely the progress of the 
realization of the revenues under his control and check the recoveries made 
against the demands. 
6. Every departmental controlling officer should obtain regular accounts and returns 
from his subordinates for the amounts realized by them and paid into the treasury 
and consolidate the figures in a register so as to show the total receipts for each 
month classified according to the heads of account in the budget estimates.  The 
controlling officer should compare the figures compiled in this register with 
accounts received from the Accountant- General and reconcile any differences as 
early as possible in communication with the Treasury officers concerned , and if 
necessary with the Accountant General  also.  The reconciliation of the figures 
for March is especially important and should be completed as early as possible, 
since any corrections that may be required in the Accountant-General’s books 
have to be made before the accounts of the year are closed.  When a wrong credit 
is discovered, the controlling officer should inform the Accountant-General at 
once in order that the accounts may be corrected.  When a subordinate 
Government servant’s return includes a credit for which there is no corresponding 
credit in the accounts received from the Accountant-General, the controlling 
officer, should in the first instance call for full information from the subordinate 
Government servant.   
Note1: It is essential that the departmental accounts of revenue should not be 
compiled from the returns prepared by the treasury. But the Treasury Officer may 
149 
be required, where necessary, to verify the returns prepared for submission to the 
departmental controlling authority.   
Note2: In order to facilitate check by controlling officers and to prevent 
misclassification in the treasury accounts, all receipts of revenue should be noted in 
the chalan.  The chalan should show distinctly on what account the money is to be 
received and under what detailed head of revenue it has been entered in the 
departmental accounts.  The entry in the departmental accounts should be completed 
before the amount is credited into the treasury. ie, the entry in the departmental 
accounts should show the amount as received.  
Note 3: Revenue collected in one district on account of another should be credited 
in the treasury account of the receiving district under the appropriate head of 
account and the fact intimated to the appropriate departmental officer in the district 
concerned.  Any such item of revenue should be omitted in the demand, collection 
and balance statement of the receiving district and included in that of the district to 
which it belongs.  Footnotes should be added to the demand, collection and balance 
statements of both the districts to explain the difference between these statements 
and the treasury accounts.   
7. The daily collection of each officer should ordinarily be remitted to the treasury 
on the next working day.  When this is not possible owing to distance from the 
treasury or other cause, the money should be remitted periodically, the last 
remittance for the month including the last receipt, which can reach the treasury 
in the same month.  The subsequent receipts of the month should be entered in 
the departmental register of the next month.  Remittances made to a sub treasury 
after the close of the accounts of the latter should be similarly entered in the 
departmental registers of the succeeding month.  At the end of the year, however, 
all the receipts of the year should be arranged to be brought into the treasury 
accounts of the same year.   
150 
8. To ensure that all collections are being paid regularly into the treasury, the officer 
immediately responsible for the collections will keep the receipts (chalans) for 
amounts so paid in proper files.  Inspecting officers will compare all the entries in 
the counterfoils in the printed counterfoil receipt book with those in the Register of 
collections and with any original receipt they may be able to obtain from the person 
to whom they are issued.   
 
The comparison by inspecting officers will be made from the time of the last 
inspection and the accounts should be inspected on the spot at least once in every 
year.  The selection of inspecting officers rests with the heads of departments and 
district officers, as the case may be.  The officer in charge should therefore keep the 
orders sanctioning the sale in proper file, and the inspecting officer should check the 
register with them to see that the proper amounts have been entered.   
 
Every payment into the treasury or the bank for credit to the Government shall 
be accompanied by a memorandum or chalan containing all the particulars necessary 
for crediting the amount correctly in the Government account and preparing a receipt 
to be given to the payee.  When a payment is made into the treasury, the treasury 
shall check the chalan and make sure that it is in order and complete, test and count 
the money, bring the payment into account in the prescribed registers and give a 
receipt to the payee.   
The receipt head of accounts are essential for remitting the amount due to 
Government collected in offices under various items especially through TR receipts. 
The details of receipt head of accounts are available in the budget document for that 
particular year. The receipt head of accounts for 2020-21 are shown below;

3.2.3. Cash Book 
 
The cash books should be maintained in the manner prescribed in Article 92 of 
the Kerala Treasury Code.  The cash book should be bound in convenient volumes 
and their pages machine numbered.  The head of office or a subordinate gazetted 
officer nominated by him should count the number of pages and record a certificate 
of count on the first page of the cash book.  The cash books should be closed daily 
and completely checked.  At the end of each month the head office should verify the 
cash balance in the cash book and record a signed and dated certificate to that effect.  
All the transactions should be entered in the Cash Book as soon as they occur and 
attested by the head of office as a token of his check.  
154 
The Government will hold a Government servant personally responsible for 
any loss sustained by the Government through fraud or negligence on his/her part, 
and also for any loss sustained through fraud or negligence on the part of any other 
Government servant to the extent to which it may be shown that he/she contributed 
to the loss by his/her own action or negligence. 
 
A Government servant  who has to arrange for public moneys to be carried 
from one place to another by a messenger should take all reasonable precautions to 
prevent any loss in transit due to misappropriation of money by the messenger or any 
other cause .  He/she should pay due regard to all relevant factors including the status 
of the messenger employed and the distance over which the moneys have to be 
carried.  As far as possible, he/she should use for this purpose only permanent 
Government servants whom he/she knows to be reliable.   
3.2.4. Verification of cash balance 
 
The contents of the cash chest must be counted every time the cash book is 
closed and the amount compared with the book balance.  In offices in which there 
are no daily transaction or the transactions are few, it will be within the discretion of 
the head of the office concerned to order, on his own responsibility, the closing of 
the register at a longer interval, but the register should be closed and the cash balance 
verified often enough to prevent malpractice and in no case less frequently than once 
a month.  The officer in charge should record a certificate of count in the cash book 
in his own handwriting specifying the actual balance both in words and figures and 
sign it with date. 
3.2.5. GST (Goods and Service Tax) 
GST is an Indirect Tax levied on the supply of goods and services.  It is single 
tax on the supply of goods and services for the whole of India, right from the 
manufacturer to the consumer making India one unified common market.  Taxes paid 
at each stage of trade will be available in the subsequent stage of value addition as 
155 
input credit set off, which makes GST essentially a tax only on the value addition at 
each stage.  The final consumer will thus bear only the GST charged by the last 
dealer in the supply chain, with set-off benefits at all the previous stages.  It has 
replaced various indirect taxes and brought them under one umbrella to make 
compliance easier.  The GST scheme consists of different slab structure under which 
the proposed goods and services will be taxed accordingly.   
For further details refer: Kerala State GST Act – 2017 
3.2.6. Expenditure – General principles 
1. No Government servant may incur any item of expenditure from public funds 
unless the following two conditions are both satisfied:- 
(a) The expenditure must have been sanctioned by a general or special order 
of the authority competent to sanction such expenditure; and  
(b) Sufficient funds must have been provided for the expenditure in the 
Appropriation Act(s) for the current financial year or by a 
reappropriation of funds sanctioned by a competent authority. 
No authority subordinate to Government should sanction any expenditure unless 
sufficient funds have already been provided for the purpose either in the 
Appropriation Act(s) or by reappropriation.  
2. It should, however, be clearly understood that it is an important financial 
principle  that money indisputably payable should not, as far as possible, be 
left unpaid and that money paid should under no circumstances be kept out of 
accounts a day longer than is absolutely  necessary even though the payment is 
not covered by the proper sanction.  It is no economy to postpone inevitable 
payments even for the purpose of avoiding an excess over a grant or 
appropriation and it is very important to ascertain, liquidate and record the 
payment of all actual obligations at the earliest possible date.  It must be borne 
in mind that if an inevitable payment is required to be made in the absence of 
156 
funds, the error lies not so much in the payment as in the entering into the 
relevant liability.   
A disbursing officer may not on his own authority authorize any 
payment in excess of the funds placed at his disposal, but absence of funds 
should not necessarily prevent the payment of any sums really due by 
Government. If the disbursing officer is called upon to honor a claim, which is 
certain to produce an excess over the allotment or appropriation at his disposal, 
he should take the orders of the administrative authority to which he is 
subordinate before authorizing payment of the claim in question.  
All appropriations lapse at the close of the financial year. A Government 
servant should not on any account reserve or appropriate by transfer to a deposit 
or any other head or draw from the treasury and keep in a cash chest any portion 
of an appropriation remaining unexpended during the year in order to prevent 
it from lapsing and use it for expenditure after the end of the year.  No attempt 
should be made to prevent the lapse of an appropriation by any undue rush of 
expenditure during March.   
(a) In every application for sanction to fresh expenditure, it should be 
distinctly stated whether provision for the proposed expenditure has 
been made in the budget appropriations for the year, and if such 
provision has not been made whether sufficient funds can be found 
by re-appropriation. 
(b) Authorities who sanction new expenditure after funds have been 
communicated should be careful to indicate the source of 
appropriation.  
           Where it is desired to sanction expenditure before funds have been 
communicated, as may be necessary in order to avoid delay in starting work at the 
beginning of a new financial year or to prevent duplication of orders, the authority 
which does so should be careful to add the word “subject to funds being 
communicated in the budget of the year”. 
157 
Note: Vague expressions such as ‘subject to budget provision should carefully be 
avoided in conveying sanctions to expenditure.  
When any authority accords sanction for expenditure of a definite amount or 
up to a specified maximum limit the amount should always be expressed both in 
words and figures. A copy of every order sanctioning expenditure should be 
communicated to the Accountant General by the authority which accords sanction.  
 
When the head of a department or any other subordinate authority issues an 
order sanctioning expenditure either the sanctioning authority itself or a gazetted 
government servant working in the office of that authority should ordinarily 
communicate the order to the Accountant-General.  When this procedure would 
cause inconvenience, sanctions may be communicated over the signature of the non-
gazetted government servant who is the head ministerial officer of the office, 
provided that this arrangement is intimated beforehand to the Accountant-General 
by the sanctioning authority.  
Note: Financial sanctions communicated to audit should invariably be signed 
in ink by the sanctioning authority or other officers authorized for the purpose.  No 
action will be taken in audit on copies of financial sanctions issued over facsimile 
and cyclostyled signature of sanctioning authorities or other authorized officers.  
 
A sanction of the Government or an authority subordinate to the Government 
tokens effect from the date of the order conveying the sanction.  A sanction of any 
fresh charge accorded by the Government or an authority subordinate to the

FUNCTIONING OF AN INSTITUTION/OFFICE 
 
Section: 3. Budget 
3.3.1. Preparation of Budget Estimates and Revised Estimates  
The budget estimates are the detailed estimates of the annual receipts and 
disbursement   of the budget year.  Budget year means the financial year commencing 
on the Ist April and ending with 31 st March from which the budget is prepared.   
1. The budget estimates of expenditure and receipts for the financial year are due 
to the Government before 1st November or earlier as prescribed from time to 
time every year. 
2. The departmental subordinate officers should prepare and forward 
consolidated estimates so as to reach the head office not later than 1st October 
each year.  The estimates for plan and non-plan expenditure should be 
furnished separately.  The estimates for plan schemes should be shown scheme-
wise under the group head “Schemes under the Five year plan” under each 
minor head concerned.  The estimates of revenue should be furnished in the 
form prescribed in para 15 of Budget manual.  
3. The budget estimates fall in the two parts.  Under part 1, the ordinary actual 
estimates 
based 
on 
‘Standing 
Sanctions’ 
alone 
are 
included.  
Proposals for the abandonment of existing revenue and for schemes of new 
expenditure should not be taken into account in framing part1 estimates but 
should be submitted as part II schemes. 
4. The following instructions should be borne in mind while preparing the budget 
estimates and revised estimates:-  
(i)  All heads of offices should prepare the statement in the form prescribed 
162 
(ii) Separate statement should be prepared for each minor head. 
(iii) The revised estimate for the current year should be prepared with great 
care and should be approximately as close to the actual. Provisions should 
be made for such item of expenditure, which are really necessary. 
(iv) 
In the case of new schemes, which are introduced during the current 
year, the date of introduction and the approximate estimate of expenditure 
for the current year should be furnished in the remarks column. 
(v) Brief and clear explanation of material variation between the budget and 
revised estimates of the current year and the budget estimates of the coming 
year should be furnished. 
(vi) 
The budget statement should be accompanied by the statement showing 
the details regarding provisions made for pay of officers and pay of 
establishment.  Estimates should be framed on the basis of expenditure 
likely to be incurred for the existing staff and the actual pay to be drawn by 
them.  No provisions should be made for posts which are kept in abeyance.  
If senior officers are expected to be on other duty or on deputation, 
provision should be made in the budget estimate not for senior officers but 
only for the substitute who may be drawing a lesser pay.  
3.3.2. Preparation of monthly statement of receipt and charges  
The statement should include every item, which an officer has drawn or 
credited to the Government either by himself or through his subordinates.  The details 
in the statement should be in strict conformity with the heads in the budget 
distribution statement. Total should be given for each group head, such as pay of 
officers, pay of establishment, allowances etc. The statement should include all 
payments made into the treasury and all sums drawn from the treasury during the 
treasury 
month 
to 
which 
the 
statement 
relates.   
Where officers operate in more than one district, the name of the district, and the 
treasury or sub-treasury should be furnished.  Figures should be grouped separately 
for each district. Particular care should be taken to classify receipts and expenditure 
163 
under the correct budget heads of account, details under each head being furnished 
where necessary. The number and date of treasury receipts should be noted in support 
of the receipts during the month with the name of the treasury, sub-treasury or bank 
concerned. All references and memoranda of discrepancies on the monthly accounts 
should ordinarily be replied within three days of receipt by the Head of office and if 
in any case information has to be got from outside, they should not be delayed beyond 
seven days at the latest.  All final orders regarding correction in the account should 
be carried out forthwith.  Rush of expenditure in March is objectionable.  Monthly 
expenditure should as far as possible, be proportionately maintained.  
3.3.3. Reconciling Departmental Figures and Treasury Figures 
1. All heads of offices should reconcile their figurers with the treasury figures 
before they forward their monthly statements of charges and receipts to the 
Director of Agriculture.  They should see that the reconciliation work is 
completed not later than 5th of   each month without fail.  The heads of offices 
who are stationed in or near the District Head Quarters as well as those who 
are stationed away from the District Treasury and who have been specifically 
authorised to do so should send their clerks to the District Treasury for the 
purpose of reconciliation.  If there are discrepancies between the Treasury 
figures and departmental figures, the Treasury figures should be furnished and 
the discrepancies explained.   The following certificates should be furnished:- 
2. Certified that the departmental figures were verified and reconciled with those 
of the Treasury on ............ and found correct except those for which 
explanations are furnished. 
3. Heads of offices who draw bills on treasuries outside their district headquarters 
should forward a list of bills cashed to the principal Agricultural Officers 
concerned so as to reach them on or before the 3rd of every month.  
The Principal Agricultural Officers should get the list verified with the 
Treasury and return them to the concerned officers with a certificate of 
verification, along with treasury figures wherever discrepancies are found.  A

         Government of Kerala 
Guidelines for regularization of existing eligible casual sweepers and 
appointments against future arising vacancies of sweeper/cleaners in 
Government offices 
GO (P) No.501/2005/Fin. Dated, Thiruvananthapuram 25th November 2005 
 
1. 
For the regularization of the existing casual sweepers (where the sweeping area 
exceeds 100 M2), creation of posts of part time contingent employees 
depending on the sweeping area has to be made.  The sweeping    area will be 
calculated in accordance with the guidelines given below. As far as 
regularization of existing casual sweepers are concerned, the measurement will 
be made by the PWD official after notice to the incumbent casual sweeper and 
165 
in his presence.  The incumbent casual sweeper will also sign in the format 
either agreeing with the measurement or disagreeing with it.  The exercise will 
be completed in all cases by 15.12.2005.  If, on fixation, the area is seen to 
exceed 100 M2 and if there is no post of part time sweeper sanctioned for the 
office in question, but there is a casual sweeper being engaged, the Head of the 
Office shall immediately take up with the government for creation of a post of 
part-time contingent sweeper.  The copies of the certificate of the PWD 
Engineer and full details of the case shall be furnished along with the proposal.  
The administrative department in government shall then issue orders before 
21.01.2006, in consultation with the Finance Department, for the creation of 
the post of part-time sweeper in relaxation of the economy orders and 
absorbing the existing casual sweeper by giving the remuneration of Rs.1250/- 
plus DA p.m., (for area 100 M2 and above but below 400 M2) and Rs. 1500 /- 
plus D.A p. m (for area 400 M2 and above but below 800 M2) The posts shall 
be created with effect from the date of appointment of the incumbent as Casual 
sweeper or from 18.06.2001 (i.e., 3 years preceding the date of judgement) 
whichever is later.  The absorption/regularization shall be done with effect 
from this date only.  Back arrears shall be payable only with effect from this 
date of regularization.  The period spent prior to regularization shall not count 
for any purpose.  
2. If on re-fixation of the area, it is found to be less than 100sq.m. (requiring only a 
casual sweeper @600/- p.m.) and if, there is a casual sweeper already working, 
he/she shall continue without disruption, getting only Rs 600/- p.m. 
3. There could be a few cases where the existing casual sweepers were terminated in 
accordance with the Government order of 19-7-2003 and new persons selected 
through employment exchange.  There would then be 2 claimants for the same 
post.  This would be decided on a case to case basis, if necessary, 
accommodating such persons in other offices. Such cases will also be reported 
to Government and absorption done only under the orders of the Government. 
166 
4. The guidelines shall also be applied to offices which already have part-time 
contingent sweepers.  If consequent to the re-fixation of the area in such offices 
in accordance with the guidelines,  the sweeping area increases from below 400 
M2 to above 400 M2 the part time sweeper concerned shall be entitled to the 
higher remuneration of  Rs. 1500/- plus DA but with effect from the date of the 
Government order only.  If the area reduces from above 400 M2 to below 400 
M2 the remuneration of the particular part-time sweeper shall not be reduced 
from Rs.1500/- plus DA. The existing incumbent shall continue to get what he 
was getting. But the employee posted against the next vacancy should be given 
wage as per the rules. If on fixation the sweeping area reduces from 100 M2 to 
below 100 M2 the remuneration of the existing part-time sweeper, if he/she is 
getting Rs.1250/- p.m. plus DA, shall not be reduced.  He/she shall continue to 
get what he was getting.  Here also, the next vacancy in the post should be 
filled up by a casual sweeper only, by paying Rs. 600 per month. 
5.  All existing premises will get certified once again, over the next 1 year. The 
certification of sweeping area shall be done once in 5 years. The responsibility 
of this is vested with the head of office in question.  
6. Part-time contingent sweepers will be employed in new offices and also against 
arising vacancies in future, only on accordance with the rules i.e., after getting 
the names from the employment exchange. Under no circumstances will any 
person be engaged otherwise than through Employment Exchange.  If there is 
delay in making such posting, the vacancies can be filled up for two months, 
only through a contract with the local Kudumbasree Society.  As the sweeping 
work requires only 1 to 2 hours of work a day, the society shall be paid Rs.4 
per M2 plus Rs. 250/- as monthly remuneration, subject to the condition that 
the total monthly payment shall not be less than Rs.600/- .It is reiterated that 
the payment will be made to the society and not to the individual.   
7. 
Creation of the post of part-time contingent sweeper in newly formed offices 
shall be done strictly on the basis of the new guidelines given below. As it will 
167 
not be possible to assess in advance the sweeping area in respect of newly 
formed offices, such posts shall be created only after assessing the sweeping 
area. The sweeping area shall be determined in accordance with the new 
guidelines.  If the sweeping area is below 100 M2 or above but below 800 M2, 
the matter will be taken up immediately with the Government for the creation 
of the post of part-time contingent sweeper.  After the post is created, a part-
time contingent sweeper will be engaged, but only through Employment 
Exchange.  This should be done within two months.  He/she should be paid 
wages as per the sweeping area (Rs. 1250/- plus DA for sweeping area of 100-
400 sq. m and Rs.1500/- plus DA for a sweeping area of 400-800 M2) 
8. 
If the sweeping area is above 800 M2, but below 900 M2. a part-time contingent 
sweeper and a casual sweeper will be engaged.  If it is above 900 M2, 2 part-
time contingent sweepers can be engaged. The same logic will apply if the area 
exceeds 1600 M2, etc. For this also the matter is to be taken up with 
Government with the certificate from the concerned Engineer of the Public 
Works Department.  The concerned department will issue orders to create the 
post in consultation with the Finance department, till the candidate sponsored 
by the Employment Exchange reports for duty, the agreement with the 
Kudumbasree may continue.  On no account shall casual sweepers be engaged 
in such cases.   
All the Government orders referred to above, will stand modified to the extent 
indicated in this Government order GO(P)No.361/2005/Fin dated 2.08.2005 stands 
rescinded.

landing etc. are shared by the office in question with other  state Government or 
quasi State Government office only, such common areas shall be apportioned 
among the various offices in question, in proportion to the carpet area of each such 
office.  
3.  If the common area of car porch, staircase, verandah, corridor, landing etc. are 
shared with private premise, then that  portion of the common area appurtenant to 
the office in equation alone will be included in the sweeping are, subject, of course,

Travelling Allowance is an allowance granted to an officer to cover the 
expenses incurred by him in travelling in the interest of public service. It includes 
allowances granted for the maintenance of conveyance (R.12 (37) PI KSRs).  
3.5.3.1. Permanent Travelling Allowance (PTA): 
It is a fixed monthly allowance granted to an officer for frequent travel within 
in jurisdiction. For the drawal of full amount of PTA, an officer should be on tour 
outside 8 km from his Head Quarters for 15 days in a month and should spend at least 
6 hours outside Head Quarters on each day. If this minimum tour not performed, PTA 
will be proportionately. Ordinarily PTA cannot be drawn during leave, temporary 
transfer of joining time and along with any other TA. (Rule 6 to 8, 53 & 54 Part II 
KSRs)  
3.5.3.2. Permanent conveyance Allowance (PCA): 
This is also fixed monthly allowance granted to an officer for travelling 
extensively within Head Quarters. PCA can be drawn in addition to other forms of 
179 
TA. But it cannot be drawn during leave or temporary transfer or on holidays prefixed 
or suffixed to leave or joining time (Rule 9 to 11 Part II KSRs). 
3.5.3.3. Mileage Allowance: 
This is an allowance calculated on the distance travelled, which is grnted to 
meet the cost of a particular journey. Rate of mileage in respect of different journeys 
(Rail, Road, Air, and Water) is varied (Rule 12 to 36 Part II KSRs) 
3.5.3.4. Daily Allowance: 
This is a uniform allowance for each day of absence from Head Quarter, which 
is intended to cover the ordinary charges incurred by an officer in consequence of 
such absence. (Rule 37 to 40 Part II KSRs). 
3.5.3.5. Actual Expense: 
This is the actual cost or part of the actual cost of TA, where no means of 
conveyance by on at the expense of the Government, or to be drawn as TA, is 
permissible. (Rule 41 Part II KSRs) 
3.5.4. Calculation of Tour TA  
The following are the main points to be borne in mind while calculating Tour 
Travelling Allowance. 
The Head Quarters of an officer shall be in such a place as the Government may 
prescribe (Rule 46) 
1) The Government may define the limits of the sphere of duty of any officer 
(Rule 47) 
2) An officer is on tour when absent on duty from his HQ either within or with 
proper sanction beyond his sphere of duty and permitted (Rule 48) 
3) The TA drawn by an officer on tour ordinarily takes the shape of either 
PTA or Daily Allowance, if either of these is admissible to him (Rule 52). 
180 
4) Minimum TA admissible is one DA, when an officer goes outside his Head 
Quarters on tour except in cases where means of locomotion is supplied 
(Rule 55). It cannot be drawn for any day on which a Government servant 
does not reach a point outside of a radius of 8 km from the duty point at his 
HQ or return to it from a similar point (Rule 57) 
5) For journeys within a radius of 8 km from HQ an officer not in receipt of 
conveyance allowance can be given the actual hiring charges of 
conveyance. (Rule 64 & notes)

addition to the allowances for incidental expenses admissible for air 
journey (Note 4 under Rule 58) when no boarding and lodging facility is 
provided by the Indian Airlines. 
7) Daily allowances may not be drawn except during absence from HQ on 
duty (Rule 56). When two journeys are performed within a period of 24 
hours, the period of absence from HQ will be treated as one day irrespective 
of the fact that the journey was performed on two calendar days, and Daily 
Allowance is granted accordingly (Rule 56) 
8) When journey is performed for more than 32 km and the mileage calculated 
comes to less than the amount of one Dam the DA of the officer can be 
exchanged for mileage allowances (G D (ii) to Rule 63) 
9) The DA admissible for halt at an out station and DA /MA admissible for 
the journey should be calculated separately irrespective of whether the halt 
is preceded or followed by a journey which qualifies for daily or mileage 
allowance (GD (i) to Rule 63) 
181 
10) When Government vehicle is provided no mileage allowance will be   
allowed; only incidental expenses subject to a minimum of half DA (Note

23. Auto rickshaw/ taxi charges at the rate admissible will be reimbursed for 
the journey from residence or office to Airport/Railway station / Bus station 
and back, subject to a maximum distance of 8 km each way. Only Grade I 
officers are eligible for taxi charge (Note 3 to Rule 14).

Department. 
186 
officiating government servant 
who has no substantive post 
Note: The Government Servants authorised to draw pay and travelling allowance 
bills of establishments may sanction advances of pay and travelling allowance to 
themselves.  
 
(1) Conditions on which an advance is granted 
 
An advance should not exceed one month’s pay plus the travelling allowance 
to which the government servant is expected to become entitled under the rules in 
consequence of the transfer.  
Note 1 – The advance of pay will be limited to the extent of the pay the government 
servant is in receipt of immediately before transfer or the pay that he will be 
entitled to after transfer, whichever is less.  
Note2:- If a government servant holds a temporary post, or officiates in a post or 
in a post without a lien on a permanent post or officiates in a higher post but has 
lien on a permanent lower post only, his pay for the purpose of this rule will be 
his pay in the temporary post or his officiating pay as the case may be. 
i) 
An advance on account of a transfer should invariably be recorded on the 
Government Servant’s last pay Certificate (See also Rule 168(f) of part V 
of the Kerala Treasury Code)  
ii) 
The advance of pay should be recovered from the government servant’s pay 
in three equal monthly instalments and the first instalment should be 
deducted from the first full month’s pay drawn after the transfer. The first 
two instalments should be fixed in whole rupees, and the remaining balance 
including any fraction of a rupee should be recovered as the third 
instalment.  The advance of travelling allowance should be recovered in full 
in the government servant’s travelling allowance bill for the journey in 
question.  The government servant should present this bill as soon as 
possible at the close of the month in which the journey was performed, and 
187 
if the amount of the bill is less than the advance, he/she should refund the 
balance in cash at once.  When recoveries have to be made from the same 
government servant on account of more than one advance pay drawn on 
transfer, the recoveries should be made concurrently. Any amount 
recovered from the government servant in excess of the advance drawn 
should, if it remains unclaimed for one year from the date of the last 
recovery, be credited as revenue to the government.

If any member of a Government servant’s family does not accompany him 
but follows him within six months from the date of his transfer a separate 
advance may be granted at the time on account of the travelling expenses 
on that member, provided that no advance has already been drawn for the 
same purpose.  
When a single advance is drawn for the travelling expenses of both the government 
servant and his family, it may be adjusted by submitting more than one bill, if the 
members of the government servant’s family do not actually complete the journey 
with him/her.  The government servant should however, certify on each adjustment 
bill that he will submit a further bill in due course for the travelling allowance 
admissible on account of the members of his/her family (to be specified) who have 
not yet completed the journey and that he/she expects the amount claimed in that bill 
to be not less that the balance left to be adjusted.  If necessary, he/she should refund 
a part of the balance in cash before signing this certificate. 
3.6.2. Other Advances 
Loans and advances are granted for Thiruvonam festival, purchase of mosquito 
nets, purchase of conveyance viz., motor cars, motor cycle, and bicycles, for the 
construction of houses and for performing tours.  The details regarding the drawal

FUNCTIONING OF AN INSTITUTION/OFFICE 
 
Section: 7. Contingencies 
Contingent charges or contingencies refer to the incidental expenditure which 
is necessarily incurred in running an office.  The main items are cycle, electricity, 
cleaning charges, customs duty on the imported stores, freight and tour charges.  It 
also includes incidental expenditure, which is required for technical or other reason 
in the working of particular offices and departments. 
For the purpose of control and audit, contingent charges are grouped as follows:-  
1. Countersigned contingencies and  
2. Non countersigned contingencies 
Expenditure incurred by a government servant on countersigned contingencies is 
under the direct supervision of a higher authority known as the controlling officer or 
authority who signs the detailed bills relating to them.  In this case monthly detailed 
contingent bills have to be submitted to the controlling officer for check and 
countersignature. 
Non-countersigned contingencies are those for which detailed bills are not 
required to be sent to the controlling officer but which are under the direct audit of 
the Accountant-General.  
Contingent charges may again be classified according to the sanction into- 
(a) Ordinary contingencies, i.e., those which are incurred by disbursing officers 
without sanction of any higher authority.   
190 
(b) Special contingencies. i.e., contingent charges which are of a special 
character that cannot be incurred without the special sanction of a superior 
authority.  These include supplies and services and periodical charges, such 
as rent etc. 
3.7.1. Contingent Register 
A register of contingent expenditure should be kept in each office in form No. 
10 of Kerala Financial Code. Separate registers may be opened if convenient for the 
countersigned and non-countersigned contingencies.  The following points should be 
observed in maintaining the register:  
(a) The pages should be numbered in advance 
(b) The allotment for the year under each secondary unit should be entered at 
the top of each page in the space provided 
(c) The bills should be serially numbered from the commencement to the end 
of the official year 
(d) The money column should be used for posting figures only 
(e) A progressive total for each column should be struck monthly immediately 
after the monthly total.  It should include all payments and bills paid by 
book transfer under each head from the beginning of the year up to the end 
of the last completed month. Care should be taken to arrange the heading of 
the columns of the Contingent Register according to those printed in the 
contingent bills 
(f) Dates of vouchers and bills should invariably be entered as well as the 
payee’s name.  In the column to whom paid “the vendor” or other payee’s 
name should be entered. The name of the disburser should be entered only 
when the wages of coolies etc. are paid. 
(g) Very brief but intelligible reports should be furnished against each item of 
expenditure including work bills in the remarks column. 
191 
(h) The officer in charge should initial each entry in the space allotted for the 
purpose. 
(i) The date and place of encashment should be noted against the amount of 
the respective bills in the remarks column.  
(j) Advances drawn should be shown separately in red ink, in the advance 
column under the initials of the officer in charge and accounted for 
immediately below it.  If this is not done, the number of the page in the 
register where they are accounted for should invariably be noted against the 
corresponding advance.  
(k) Advances made from the permanent advance to peons for railway fares and 
office expenses in camps etc. should be entered immediately after the 
disbursement in the proper column in the register. When each advance is 
subsequently adjusted the fact should be noted in the remarks column. 
(l) The amount of the bills paid by book transfer should be entered in the 
contingent register in red ink and the balance of appropriation available 
should be reduced accordingly. 
3.7.2. Vouchers  
(a) Subject to the provisions of clause (b) below a Government servant shall obtain 
for every disbursement which he makes on behalf of the Government including 
every repayment of money which has been deposited with the Government, a 
voucher setting forth full and clear particulars of the claim, using as far as  
possible the particular form, if any, prescribed for the purpose and shall obtain 
at the time of making payment,  either on the voucher or in a separate sheet to 
be attached to it and acknowledgment of the payment signed by the payee by 
hand and in ink.  When possible, he shall require the payee to note the actual 
date of payment in his acknowledgment.  When it is not possible for the payee 
to note the actual date of payment either due to his/her illiteracy or because 
he/she is required to present a signed receipt before payment is made the 
disbursing officer shall enter the actual date of payment on the relevant voucher 
192 
with his/her initials either separately for each payment or for groups of payment 
as may be found convenient.  
If a payee is unable to write, his/her signature on the acknowledgement 
shall be taken in the form of his marks or preferably his/her thumb impression, 
attested invariably by some known person. 
(b) If, in very exceptional circumstances, it is quite impossible to furnish a proper 
voucher with the payee’s acknowledgment in support of a payment, a 
certificate of payment showing the particulars of the claim, signed by the 
disbursing officer and endorsed by his immediate superior, shall be placed on 
record.  
(c) A disbursing officer may retain a certified copy marked “Duplicate” of a 
receipted voucher, when this is necessary in order to complete the record in his 
office, but the payee shall not be required to sign any such copy or to give a 
duplicate acknowledgement of the payment.  
(d) No voucher shall be treated as a valid voucher unless it bears a distinct pay 
order, specifying the amount payable both in words and in figures separately 
and signed or initialled and dated, by hand and in ink by the responsible 
disbursing officer.  Cashiers and other government servants who are authorised 
to make payments on passed vouchers shall not make any payment on a 
voucher unless it bears pay order satisfying the requirements.  
(e) All vouchers and acquittances are important documents and should be filed and 
preserved carefully in the office concerned, when they are not sent elsewhere 
for audit in accordance with the rules. 
3.7.3. Cancellation of Sub-Vouchers  
(a) Sub-vouchers to contingent bills should be cancelled in such manner that they 
cannot subsequently be used fraudulently to claim or support a further 
payment.   
(b) Whenever a drawing officer signs a fully-vouched contingent bill for 
presentation at the treasury for payment or a detailed contingent bill for 
193 
submission to the controlling authority, he should at the same time cancel all 
the sub vouchers  which relate to the bill but are not attached to it and are 
retained for record in his/her office. He should endorse the word ‘cancelled’ 
across each such sub-voucher in red ink or by a rubber stamp, and initial it with 
the date.  He should certify on the bill that all the sub-vouchers relating to it 
other than those attached to it have been so cancelled that they cannot be used 
again. When the amount of a sub-voucher exceeds the permanent advance, it 
should be cancelled in the manner described above, as soon as the payment has 
been made and entered in the contingent register.  
Whenever a controlling authority forwards a detailed contingent bill to the 
Accountant General, he should cancel in the manner described above all the 
sub-vouchers received with the bill but not forward it to the Accountant 
General and should certify on the bill that all such sub-vouchers have been so 
cancelled that they cannot be used again. 
(c) Sub-vouchers which are sent to the Accountant General should not be 
cancelled either by the drawing and disbursing officer or by the controlling 
officer.  They will be cancelled in the office of the Accountant General after 
audit under the rules of the Audit Department.  
(d) Sub vouchers should not be destroyed until three years have elapsed from the date 
of payment (See Article 358 of Kerala Financial Code)  
3.7.4. Contingencies to meet wages of Labourers 
The labourers employed in various farms are of two kinds, viz; (1) Permanent 
Labourers whose wages are paid monthly and (2) Casual Labourers on daily wages.  
Muster rolls should be maintained for all labourers on manual labour paid at daily or 
monthly rates and the contingent bills in which their wages are drawn should be 
supported by the following certificate signed by the disbursing officer: “Certified that 
194 
all labourers whose pay has been charged in this bill were actually entertained in 
government service during the period concerned’’.  
3.7.5. Part time contingent sweeper 
The part time contingent sweepers will be employed in new offices and also 
against arising vacancies in future only in accordance with the rules i.e., after getting 
the names from the employment exchange. The creation of the post of Part time 
contingent sweeper in newly formed offices shall be done strictly on the basis of the 
guidelines. If the sweeping area is below 100 M2, a casual sweeper through 
Kudumbasree can be engaged by the Head of office without creating a post (GO (P) 
No.74/14/Fin.Dt.20/02/14). 
If the sweeping area is 100 M2 or above, but below 800 M2, the matter will be 
taken up immediately with the government for the creation of the post of PTS. If the 
sweeping area is 800 M2 or above but below 900 M2, a PTS and a casual sweeper will 
be engaged. If it is above 900 M2, two part time sweepers can be engaged.  The same 
logic will apply if the area exceeds 1600 M2. For further details, refer GO (P) 
501/2005/Fin Dt.25/11/2005.

Section: 8. Government Vehicles 
 
 
All vehicles belonging to the Government Departments should be registered 
under the Motor Vehicles Act. Section 22 of the said Act stipulates that no motor 
vehicle shall be driven in any public place or in any other place for the purpose of 
carrying passengers or goods unless it is registered. The vehicle so misused can be 
detained by any officer authorized on this behalf. Violation of this section is also 
punishable under law. These statutory provisions do not contemplate any special 
concession in favour of vehicles belonging to Government Departments.  
 
The government vehicles of the department should as far as possible be 
repaired at the workshop attached to O/o Assistant Executive Engineer (Agri.) or 
government approved workshop or authorized service centres in the case of new 
generation vehicles.  But if there is no government workshop nearby or if the 
government workshop is not able to undertake the work due to the pressure of work 
or other causes the repair can be arranged in some of the local private approved 
workshops.  
 
Government has declared certain private workshops in each district as 
approved workshops. If the Government institution is not able to repair the vehicle, 
the repairs may be done at any of the nearest Government approved workshop. The 
bill for the repairs effected will have to be verified by Assistant Executive Engineer 
(Agriculture), Assistant Executive Engineer, PWD, Mechanical sub division as the 
case may be before effecting payment. Sanction of the Director is necessary in all 
cases of payment of repair bills, for amounts exceeding the competency of the 
respective officers.

The Principal Agricultural Officers are empowered to sanction repair work of 
vehicles for an amount up to Rs. 3,000/- whereas the head of the Department is 
empowered to sanction repair work of vehicles for an amount of Rs. 30,000/- per 
vehicle with an annual limit of Rs.1 lakh. This amount includes the cost of spares and 
the labour charges. The spare shall be purchased observing store purchase rules and 
based on the approved estimate from the competent authority. A register for repair 
and maintenance of vehicles shall be maintained by the custodian officer.

No private building or building belonging to another Government may be 
rented if any suitable building belonging to the Government is available for the 
purpose for which a building is required. 
  
In case of accommodation if hired for officers and / or official residence of 
Government Servants, the first charge for rent in every year should be supported by 
a certificate from the Executive Engineer (Roads and Buildings) concerned that 
suitable Government buildings were not available and that the amount of rent fixed 
is reasonable with regard to the local conditions and the scale of accommodation 
provided.  
 
Under the Rent Control Order, unless the rent of the building has to be 
enhanced on account of any improvement effected to the building, rent certificate 
need not be insisted for every financial year subsequent to next fixation. However, 
the certificate regarding the non-availability of government buildings to 
accommodate the office will be required annually.  
Note: - In the case of departments in which a Civil Engineering unit is functioning, 
the certificate regarding the reasonableness of rent issued by the Executive Engineer 
or the officer –in – charge of the unit exercising the powers of an Executive Engineer 
198 
of the department concerned, may be accepted. The non-availability of Government 
buildings even in these cases should be testified by the Public Works Department.  
(b) 
No building may be rented on a rent in excess of the financial powers or taken 
on lease for a period exceeding three years, except with the specific approval of 
Government. The production of the Executive Engineer’s certificate as required in (a)

(c) 
When a private building is rented, it should be rented on the condition that the 
rent will be paid in arrears on the first working day after each month’s occupation and 
the rent should invariably be paid accordingly.  
(d) 
Insurance against fire for private buildings rented by the Government is left to 
the option of the owner. If he insures the building, he/she should pay the premium out 
of the rent. The lease deed for any such building should make it clear that the 
government is not liable for damage caused by fire.

In respect of all private buildings taken on rent for departmental purposes a 
lease deed in the form given below should be executed by the owner of the building 
with such modifications that may be necessary to suit each case. The period of lease

Section: 11. Stock verification  
 
 
The head of an office or any other Government servant entrusted with stores 
should take special care for the safe custody of the stores in his charge and maintain 
suitable accounts or inventories for (a) expendable stores, and (b) office furniture and 
all other stores except books, forms and stationery for which separate registers have 
been prescribed.  
1. The stock accounts required on account of raw materials and expendable 
stores include daybooks of receipts and issues for recording the 
transactions as they take place and a ledger for each kind of article 
showing the receipts, issues and balances. Forms 16 and 17 prescribed 
in Kerala Financial Code should be used for this purpose.  
2. The stock account of furniture and all other stores (except books, forms 
and stationery) should be in form No. 18, Kerala Financial Code 
showing the number received, the number issued or disposed of, and the 
balance in hand for each kind of article separately.  
3. Every head of office should maintain stock accounts for forms and 
stationery in accordance with the rules in the stationery manual and also 
a register in form No.19 of the books belonging to the office.  
 
Stores should be verified periodically in the manner prescribed for each 
department and in any case at least once in a year, subject to any special rules or 
orders. The expendable stores and raw materials should be sent to the controlling 
authorities who will be required to check the inventories as part of their inspections. 
Every receipt and issue of stores should be recorded in the inventories at the time 
when articles are received or issued as the case may be.  
204 
 
In the case of furniture in large offices distributed over several rooms, the head 
of the office may have inventory cards put up in each room which should be kept upto 
date to facilitate the annual verification of stock and to fix the responsibility, for 
losses. In the case of furniture and other office stores the stock should be verified by 
actual physical verification at least once in a year, by the head of the office or by the 
head of ministerial staff responsible for such stock. A certificate of verification should 
be submitted for countersignature by the controlling officer who may verify all items 
or conduct a test check for assuring himself of the accuracy of stock on hand and 
correctness of the verification reports.  
 
Besides such periodical verification, which has to be conducted at least once in 
a year, stock verification has to be conducted whenever there is a change of 
incumbency of the charge officer. The staff should submit the annual verification 
certificate to the controlling officer concerned by the 10th of April every year. All 
departmental officers should submit their annual verification certificate to the 
Director by 15th of April each year with the addition that “similar certificates have 
been obtained from each of the subordinate officers under the control”.  
3.11.1. Unserviceable Articles 
 
Stores which have become unserviceable are of two kinds: 
1. Stores which become unserviceable in the ordinary course or by fair wear and 
tear and 
2. Stores which become unserviceable otherwise than in the ordinary course  
The write off articles falling under the two categories should be sanctioned 
separately. Articles coming under item No.1 can be condemned by the authority 
competent to purchase new ones for replacement. Full reasons for condemning 
such unserviceable articles must be recorded on such orders of write off together 
with a certificate in the following manner; 
 
“Certified that I have personally satisfied myself that each item written off 
under these proceedings have become unserviceable in the ordinary course through 
proper usage or by fair wear and tear”.  
205 
 
The orders condemning such stores should state how the items are to be 
disposed of, by sale or by destruction, since stores should be condemned only when 
they cannot be made serviceable by repair. Unserviceable stores which have not been 
condemned for destruction should be as far as possible sold under the orders of the 
controlling authority and sale proceeds credited to the Government. Full particulars 
of condemned stores should be transferred from the stock book to a separate register 
of unserviceable articles in the form 21 given in the appendix to the Kerala Financial 
Code, Volume II.

Section: 13. Matters related to auditing in the department 
 
3.13.1. Introduction 
In general, the auditing is the process of examining department’s financial 
records and procedures followed to determine if they are accurate and in accordance 
with existing rules, regulations, and laws. The main objectives of government audit 
include; to make sure that the expenditure is incurred out of the fund which the 
competent authority has sanctioned, to verify that the expenditure of the department 
is sanctioned as per the rules and regulations of the department concerned, to ensure 
that the payments have been made to the right persons and they are duly entered in 
the appropriate registers on the basis of receipts received from them, to check the 
existence of stock and stores and their proper valuation, to ensure that stocktaking is 
done periodically and stock registers are maintained up-to-date, to ensure that money 
due to government has been regularly recovered while verifying the receipts, etc. 
3.13.2. Internal audit  
The members in internal auditing wing must have sufficient proficiency and 
knowledge to carry out the tasks assigned to them. The auditor's work must be 
carefully directed, supervised and reviewed in following ways viz;  
i. 
by ensuring that the approved audit programme is completed, unless 
deviations are both justified and authorised  
ii. 
determining that the working papers adequately support the audit 
findings, conclusions and reports and 
210 
iii. 
making sure that audit reports are accurate, objective, clear, concise, 
constructive and timely.  
In the department of Agricultural Development and Farmers’ Welfare, the 
internal auditing is carried out at two levels viz; 
(i) 
The auditing team under the leadership of Accounts Officer- IV and the 
supervision of Senior Finance Officer shall conduct internal auditing in 
the Directorate, Principal Agriculture Offices and other offices under the 
direct control of Director of Agriculture.  
(ii) 
The auditing team under the leadership of Accounts Officer in the 
Principal Agriculture Offices shall conduct auditing in all offices under 
the control of Principal Agricultural Officer.  
At both levels, the auditing schedule is prefixed and organised and the auditing 
should be conducted in such a manner that the liability/non liability certificates to the 
staff at various levels shall be given within the time limit as ordered by the 
government from time to time. The guidelines issued vide GO (P) 
No.185/2002/Fin,  dtd 27/03/2002 to avoid delay in payment of pensionary benefits, 
the instructions issued in connection with the disbursement of pensionary benefits on 
the date of retirement as per Government circular No.77/2011/Fin, dtd 2/11/2011 and 
directions in connection with the disbursal of pensionary benefits without delay to 
employees retired from service  as per GO (P) No.67/2020/Fin,  dtd 27/05/2020 and 
GO (Rt.) No.952/2020/Agri,  dtd 21/11/2020 should be followed in this regard.  
3.13.2.1. Audit Process 
The first step in the audit process is to finalize the schedule for auditing in a 
particular office, the time frame to be determined based on the period from which the 
auditing has to be done. Once the schedule for auditing is finalized the same will be 
intimated to the concerned head of office in advance to make ready the details and 
documents for audit. On the day of starting the audit, officers/staff are invited to a 
meeting during which the scope of the audit shall be presented and also the auditor 
requests documents listed on an audit preliminary checklist including a copy of the 
211 
previous audit report, original bank statements, receipts, ledgers, etc. It is the prime 
responsibility of the head of office and custodian of the documents to provide required 
documents for auditing. As in the Directorate and Principal Agriculture offices, the 
custodian of encashed bills and other documents with respect to the O/o the Assistant  
Director of Agriculture is the Clerk/Senior Clerk whereas Assistant Agricultural 
Officer/Senior most Agricultural Assistant is the custodian of stock and stores and 
maintenance of accounts in Krishi Bhavan. 
On completion of audit, a report detailing the findings of the audit will be 
prepared which include problems due to non-postings, payments authorized but not 
paid, mathematical/clerical errors and other discrepancies, if any. The other audit 
concerns and a commentary describing the findings of the audit and recommended 
solutions to any problems shall also be included in the audit report. Once the audit 
report is prepared and approved by the respective Principal Agricultural 
Officer/Director of Agriculture, the same should be forwarded to the office to which

details from the officer/officers who worked  during that period is  found essential, 
the head of office shall be free to send copy of that particular para/paras of the audit 
report to the officer/officers concerned on proper acknowledgement and collect the 
details. The non-receipt of reply/ details from an officer/officers who worked during 
that period alone is not sufficient for non-submission of reply to audit report within 
the time limit of two months on the receipt of audit report. If the reply is not received 
212

dimension in the work profile of Krishi Bhavans and to utilize the expertise of the 
technical officers for improving production and productivity of crops leading to 
enhanced income of the farmers. The Agricultural Officer in the concerned Krishi 
Bhavan is in charge of the respective Plant Health Clinic.  
The major role of plant health clinic lies in the diagnostics and advisory 
services with emphasis on extension, keeping a vigil on invasive pathogen, promoting 
integrated pest management, monitoring pest/diseases distribution, their outbreak, 
issuing pest/disease alerts, organising plant health camps for creating awareness 
regarding likely appearance of pests/diseases, strengthening mobile clinic approach 
during disease/pest outbreak, etc. At panchayat level, plant health clinics are 
functioning in 252 selected Krishi Bhavans. 
255 
 
5.1.2. Agro Service Centers  
 
In agriculture, among the four factors of production, labour plays a major role. 
As a solution to the problems like lack of skilled and unskilled farm labourers, high 
wages and moreover, non-availability of labourers at the peak period of cultivation, 
Agro Service Centers (ASCs) were established at block level to make available 
required machineries to farmers at reasonable rates under the overall supervision and 
guidance of block level Assistant Director of Agriculture. The Agro Service Centre 
is attached to any one of the Krishi Bhavans in that block. 
The Agro Service Centres were established to facilitate integration of services 
like mechanization, credit support, weather advisory services, soil testing support and 
technology based services, in order to render full-fledged service to the farmers at a 
single point. These act as technology and information disseminating centres.  A 
mobile farm clinic equipped with audio visual and online support is also made 
available at block level to provide solution to field problems.  The agro service centres 
should function as one stop shop for all the requirements of farmers such as 
agricultural inputs, farm related information like credit, etc.   
The Agro Service Centre functioning in each block is a registered body under 
the Charitable Society’s Act 1955 with at least seven members preferably trained in 
agricultural operations, agricultural machinery, operation/repair and maintenance, 
plant protection activities, nursery management etc. The Agro Service Centres are 
also provided with Bio pharmacy, three wheelers (Goods vehicle), Plant nursery, soil 
testing facilities, etc. 
The Agro Service Centres will function as per the directions of the Managing 
Committee and High power committee constituted for the management and 
supervision of the Agro Service Centre. At present 97 Agro Service Centres are 
functioning under the department. 
 
 
 
256 
 
5.1.3. Karshika Karmasenas  
 
The “Karshika Karmasenas” were formed to generate employment 
opportunities to the poor, unemployed rural & urban people and to bring the rural 
labour strength under an institutional frame work. The Karshika Karmasenas  (KKS) 
constituted and functioning at Krishi Bhavan level are working as a labour bank of 
well trained, disciplined force, which provide regular and uninterrupted supply of 
labourers on reasonable wage rate on demand/call.  
 The Karshika Karmasena is a registered body under the Charitable Societies 
Act 1935. Karshika Karmasena comprises of ordinary workers, technicians and 
specific skilled workers. Karshika Karmasenas are working as per the advice of the 
Grama Panchayat Level Advisory Committee (GPLAC). The day today activities are 
managed by a managing committee. At present 297 Karshika Karmasenas are 
functioning. The Agricultural Officer of the Krishi Bhavan is the nodal officer of 
KKS and the Agricultural Assistant is the co-ordinator. 
5.1.4. Grama panchayat level weekly markets 
 
Grama  panchayat level weekly markets were established with a view to 
provide direct marketing facilities for agricultural produce at Grama panchayat level 
and provide market outlets for organic as well as GAP (Good Agricultural Practices) 
certified agricultural produce. For enabling marketing of ethnic and perishable 
agricultural produce like fruits, vegetables, millets. etc., panchayat level weekly 
markets are be promoted in all districts. Weekly markets at grama panchayat level is 
established for the speedy marketing of agricultural produces at the production centre 
itself and thereby avoid loss due to handling and transportation. 
 
The Agriculture Development and Farmers’ Welfare Department is associated 
with Kudumbasree under the Local Self-Government Department for establishing 
weekly markets in each panchayat. The market are managed by a managing 
committee having representation from members of farmer groups of Kudumbasree 
257 
and leading farmers/representatives of farmer clusters of the Panchayat. The activities 
of the weekly markets are managed by an implementation committee. 
 
5.1.5. Ecoshops  
 
     
The Ecoshops provide the customers, locally grown, chemical and 
preservative-free organic as well as GAP certified agricultural produce and bio inputs 
for crop cultivation. At present 462 ecoshops were established in the state. The safe-
to-eat produce from GAP clusters which strictly follow GAP standards can be sold 
through these outlets with proper packing and labelling at premium price satisfying 
both the consumers and the producers. Ecoshops are also established on a franchisee 
mode by the farmer’s organizations so as to extend the benefit to the farmers.  The 
produces must be cleaned, graded, packed and labelled as ‘Kerala Organic’ before 
sale through Ecoshops.   
      
5.1.6. Custom Hiring Centres 
 
The Custom Hiring Centres (CHC) attached to the office of the Assistant 
Executive Engineers (Agri.) were established in 14 districts of the state. From Custom 
Hiring Centres, all machineries for land preparation to harvesting such as tractor, 
power tiller, transplanters, combine harvesters, etc. are made available to farmers 
along with skilled labourers at a nominal rate. The rent to be collected for machinery 
is fixed by a committee constituted for this purpose. The Assistant Executive 
Engineer (Agri.) of the concerned district is in charge of each Custom Hiring Centre 
functioning at district level. 
It may also be noted that, a “CHC Farm Machinery” app is available in google 
play store and all the custom hiring centres/ Karshika Karmasenas/ entrepreneurs/ 
individuals/ farmers group can register in this app as service providers for letting out 
the farm machineries available with them. The farmers who are registered in this app 
can also know the availability of farm machineries in their vicinity and can take it on 
rental basis. 
 
258 
 
5.1.7. Krishi Padasala 
 
The Krishi Padasala (KPS) is basically a participatory extension methodology 
which recognizes the need to involve farmers in technology development and transfer 
leading to a sustainable agriculture. Krishi Padasala is also called as “schools without 
walls” and it is a platform for learning and experience sharing among farmers with 
common interests on a regular basis in the field of agriculture and make it as a 
profitable business. Krishi Padasala is conducted in farmer’s field where agro 
ecological farming, integrated farming system (IFS), multilayer cropping system or 
any other innovative technology/practice is followed by farmers. Different modules 
will be prepared for different target groups along with field visit mainly to increase 
the income of the farmers and to make the agriculture a sustainable practice. Training 
module for various subjects and any other relevant subjects will be prepared at state 
level by SAMETI 
Improved technologies in crop production, plant protection, agro processing 
and value addition and marketing aspects including plant propagation techniques will 
also be demonstrated through Krishi Padasala. Assistance will be provided for 
meeting the expenses for setting up demonstrations including inputs, equipments and 
other accessories, infrastructure expenses for Padasala. The Agricultural officer shall 
hire retired experts from Department/ KAU and skilled persons from other 
Agricultural Institutions on need basis. The Agricultural Officers should schedule and 
supervise the conduct of Krishi Padasala in the respective Krishi Bhavan area and 
Agricultural Assistants should facilitate the same. 
5.1.8. Block Level Agricultural Knowledge Centres 
 
Under the Department of Agricultural Development and Farmers’ Welfare, the 
Block Level Agricultural Knowledge Centres have started functioning attached to the 
Office of the Assistant Directors of Agriculture from 17th August, 2020 onwards with 
259 
a view to develop programmes/schemes for agricultural production/ scientific 
cultivation practices for crop production, etc. based on the peculiarities of Agro 
ecological zones, to help in the establishment of the seed villages/seed production 
clusters for the production of seeds, planting materials, organic inputs, etc. of various 
food crops, pulses, tuber crops and fruit plants, to give technical advice, trainings in 
subjects like agricultural production, processing after harvesting, value addition and 
marketing at block level and to give technical assistance to the various 
schemes/projects implemented by the local self-government and the department. The 
Assistant Directors of Agriculture at block level are responsible for the smooth 
functioning of Block Level Agricultural Knowledge Centres. Since the Kerala 
Agricultural University (KAU) is the institution which provide human resources and 
skills and technology required for the sustainable development of agriculture, the 
Block Level Agricultural Knowledge Centres are functioning with the active 
participation of KAU. The scientist from KAU acts as the nodal officer of each Block

Chapter VI 
 
AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION SYSTEM OF THE DEPARTMENT 
 
6.0. Introduction 
Agricultural extension is the application of scientific research and knowledge 
to agricultural practices through farmer education. Generally, agricultural extension 
can be defined as the “delivery of information inputs to farmers.” Agricultural 
extension is the service that provides technical advice to farmers, helps farmers 
acquire required inputs including credit for farming, provides training and evaluates 
new agricultural technologies on farmers’ fields in close collaboration with farmers, 
helps link farmers to supply chain and markets, forwards farmers’ concerns and 
problems to decision makers, etc. The extension functionaries serve as an essential 
link between agricultural researchers/scientists and farmers and between policy 
makers and farmers.  
6.1. Extension activities 
The Agriculture Development and Farmers’ Welfare Department, formerly the 
Department of Agriculture started functioning in the erstwhile Travancore on 27th 
May 1908. The strategies taken up before the formation of Kerala state were mainly 
for increasing the  food production by bringing additional areas under cultivation (eg. 
Grow more food campaign programme). Fertilizer promotion programmes, use of 
quality seeds, etc. were also resorted to during that period. 
Consequent to the formation of Kerala state, a coordinated effort on 
Agricultural extension and development activities were commenced in 1956 and the 
Department of Agriculture was refined as an organization with true scientific sense 
of purpose. 
262 
The agricultural sector in Kerala including farming and extension has 
undergone a series of experiments and changes during the last 60 years. The Intensive 
Agricultural District Programme (IADP) and Intensive Agricultural Area Programme 
(IAAP) were implemented in the 1960s. 
Consequent to the establishment of NES blocks, the activities of agriculture 
department were carried out as a part of the Block Development Office. Later, 
separated from the block development offices, Ela Development Offices for rice 
development, Coconut Package Units for coconut development, Pepper Package 
Units for spice development, etc., came into existence during 1970s. Even though 
these offices mainly aimed at the development of major crops, they actively 
coordinated the extension activities for all crops grown under their jurisdiction.  
For the development of coconut, rubber and pepper, a special scheme called 
Kerala Agricultural Development Project (KADP) was established. Area expansion 
and rejuvenation of crops like coconut and pepper, inter cropping, cattle farming, 
establishment of crumb rubber production units were its major components. A special 
setup itself came into existence in the state for implementing the KADP project 
known as Special Agricultural Development Unit (SADU) financed by the World 
Bank. The Kerala Agricultural Extension Project (KAEP) was introduced in 1981 
aiming at agricultural development and extension activities. In this project, major 
thrust was given for agricultural extension. This was also funded by the World Bank 
and was implemented through Training & Visit (T&V) System as per fixed schedule 
which enabled visit to farmers’ fields aiding development through extension 
activities.  
The present organizational setup of the department with Krishi Bhavans as the 
basic grass root level extension and development units came into existence in 1987 
as a part of reorganization of the department in all panchayats, municipalities and 
corporations by integrating the setup at that time.  
 
 
263 
6.1.1. Krishi Bhavans 
As a part of reorganization of the Agricultural Department, Krishi Bhavans 
were established in 1987 in all panchayat, municipality and corporation in the state. 
Krishi Bhavans consisting of one Agricultural officer/Agricultural field officer and 
2-3 Assistant Agricultural Officer/ Agricultural Assistant, forms the grass root level 
structure of department for all the developmental and extension activities. Krishi 
Bhavans are the frontline agriculture service delivery units located closest to the 
farmers at the grass roots level.  
Consequent to the introduction of Kerala Panchayat Raj Act, 1994 and the 
Kerala Municipality Act, 1994, certain functions, schemes and institutions were 
transferred to the local bodies as per G.O (P) No. 189/95/LAD dated 18/09/1995. 
Accordingly, 
the 
Krishi 
Bhavans 
were 
transferred 
to 
the 
grama 
panchayat/municipality/municipal corporation along with the posts sanctioned and 
staff, wealth, assets and liabilities with effect from 02/10/1995, as per Order No.        
TP 
(1) 
40258/95 
dated 
27/09/1995 
of 
the 
Director 
of 
Agriculture, 
Thiruvananthapuram. 
 At present, the Krishi Bhavan in the Grama Panchayat / Municipality / 
Municipal Corporation is functioning as a technical institution which carries out all 
the activities on agriculture at grass root level. Together with this, agricultural 
extension activities, various state and centrally sponsored schemes/projects, etc., are 
also being carried out/implemented through the Krishi Bhavans. Thus, Krishi Bhavan 
bears the complete responsibility of agricultural development and extension activities 
which are being carried out at the panchayat/municipality/ municipal corporation 
level. 
6.1.1.1. Agro clinics 
 
The department is handling both development and agricultural extension 
activities. Considering the various peculiarities and problems of Kerala agriculture, it 
is felt that, to facilitate technology transfer to farmers, the group contact system 
approach is more effective rather than individual contact. Each group formed in 
264 
ward/wards under each Krishi Bhavan have a common meeting place and is known 
as Agro Clinic.  The farmers and farm labourers involved in agricultural activities 
will be the members of the Agro clinic of the particular ward/wards. Each Agro clinic 
has a specific location, a sign board with name, the day and time of functioning of the 
agro-clinic, etc. 
Each Agro clinic has an advisory committee under the chairmanship of the 
ward member with 5 to 7 farmers, representative of co-operative department, input 
agencies, marketing agencies, NGOs, etc. as members.  A three member steering 
committee from among the farmer members of the advisory committee facilitates the 
conduct of the agro clinics regularly by mobilizing and organizing group meetings 
and diagnostic visits. 
i. At panchayat level 
   
All the agro-clinics in a panchayat is visited by the Krishi Bhavan staff as per 
the fixed schedule on a weekly basis as detailed below and approved by the Assistant 
Director of Agriculture of the concerned block.  If the monthly visit to the particular 
Agro clinics could not be conducted due to various reasons, two or more Agro clinic 
visits are combined. Altogether, the Agricultural Assistants conduct visits to all the 
Agro Clinics in a week and the Agricultural Officer visits all the Agro Clinic once in 
a month.

6.1.1.2. Agricultural Technology Management Agency  
 
Kerala adopted Agricultural Technology Management Agency (ATMA) model 
of extension during 10th Five Year Plan to address the key constraints of field level 
agricultural extension making the extension system farmer driven and farmer 
accountable. ATMA is an autonomous institution working as per Government of 
India (GOI) guidelines with financial support from central and state Governments. It 
is the nodal agency responsible for the overall management of agriculture extension 
within the district. 
ATMA is often highlighted as an innovative model of public sector agricultural 
extension involving decentralization as well as participatory & bottom up approaches. 
ATMA provides integrated extension system with agriculture and allied sectors like 
animal husbandry, dairy and fisheries so that, a farmer can get the benefit of 
technological advice and also financial assistance if any, through this single window 
system. 
ATMA is functioning as a registered body with District Collector as the 
chairman of the governing board. ATMA is headed by a Project Director ATMA in 
the cadre of Joint Director of Agriculture with two Deputy Project Directors, one in 
267 
the cadre of Deputy Director and the other in the cadre of Assistant Director from the 
agriculture/allied sectors like AH/ Dairy/Fisheries. 
ATMA is responsible for the preparation of Strategic Research Extension Plan 
(SREP) once in five years. The purposes of SREP is to increase farmers’ contribution 
in programme planning and resource allocation and to increase accountability of 
stakeholders; further it is to increase programme co-ordination and integration. The 
SREP is prepared through Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) involving all the 
stakeholders and farmers. The SREP contains detailed analysis of all the information 
on existing farming systems in the district and research – extension gaps required to 
be filled-up.  It also prioritizes the research – extension strategies within the district. 
It becomes the basis for development of work plans at district level. 
Evaluation and adoption of new technology developed by State Agricultural 
Universities or Krishi Vigyan Kendras is made possible through On Farm Trials 
(OFTs), Front Line Demonstrations (FLDs), etc. Solution to various field problems 
in agriculture and allied sector becomes possible at once through ATMA. Group 
activities through Commodity Interest Groups (CIGs) and Farmers Interest Groups 
(FIGs) have brought neighborhood farmers to undertake many activities including 
value addition. In some places, these have been federated into large groups for 
marketing also. ATMA, thus enhances group mobilization through agricultural 
extension. ATMA also brings out innovative farmers to the forefront. The exposure 
visits/exhibitions, helps the farmers in gaining information through experience 
sharing. 
6.1.1.3. Lead Farmer centered Extension Advisory and Delivery Services
 
Lead Farmer centered Extension Advisory and Delivery Services (LEADS) 
was initiated to strengthen agricultural extension further in the state and is being 
implemented in four districts viz., Kollam, Palakkad, Kannur and Wayanad. The 
scheme envisages the revitalization of regular field visit oriented agricultural 
extension system utilizing the services of lead farmers for technology dissemination 
268 
integrating ATMA. The concept is based on scientific delineation of the districts into 
Agro Ecological Zones and Agro Ecological Units.   
 
LEADS intervenes and advises farmers through the preparation of Monthly 
Technology Advisory (MTA) with the support of Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), 
Research stations etc. Kerala Agricultural University associates closely with the 
project and KVKs of the respective districts are the nodal institutions for preparing 
MTA. 
Each district is divided into Agro Ecological Units comprising of several 
panchayats for effective service delivery. Three lead farmers and a group of 10 
farmers around each lead farmer named satellite group are selected from each 
panchayat for implementation of the project. Regular field visits are conducted to 
identify the problems faced by farmers and the same is addressed through MTA.

the annual plan. 
As part of preparation of Annual plan proposals, the matter is discussed with 
field level officers and the Principal Agricultural Officer will present same in the 
meeting convened by Director of Agriculture at state level for this purpose every year. 
The reports submitted by the Principal Agricultural Officers with respect to the 
suggestion 
for 
new 
schemes/components, 
modification 
of 
existing 
schemes/programmes, component change, etc. are thoroughly verified and 
scrutinized in the planning wing as well as in the concerned implementing wing. 
274 
Accordingly, the planning wing will prepare project proposals with estimated 
project outlay in consultation with the concerned implementing wing and will be 
submitted to the Government with the approval of Director of Agriculture.  
 
7.3.1. Agro Ecological Unit approach 
 
The long lasting impact of climate change with its micro level variations on 
standing crops, soil structure, soil microflora and infrastructure in the aftermath of 
the floods and landslides that rocked the State in 2018 have prompted the planners 
and policy makers to devise climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies for 
the agricultural sector of the state. Studies conducted in major flood hit districts by 
Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) have also recognized the need for site specific 
management practices that ensures long term ecological sustainability.  
The schemes implemented by the Agriculture Development and Farmers’ 
Welfare Department are mostly crop based and catering to the whole state. The need 
for implementing schemes with a more focus-area approach to utilize the available 
funds has been felt for some time which has been seriously taken up in the post flood 
scenario of 2018. Consequently, for the comprehensive development and to rebuild 
the agriculture in the state, the Government have taken a policy decision as per GO 
(Ms.) No.66/2019/Agri, Dt.25-05-2019 to divide the agriculture sector of the state in 
to five Agro Ecological Zones (AEZ) viz; costal planes, midland laterites, foot hills, 
high hills and Palakkad planes without changing the administrative boundaries and 
continuing the existing setup of the department. As per the report published by State 
Planning Board in 2015, the state has been divided in to 23 Agro Ecological Units 
(AEUs) based on the homogeneity of the area with regard to vegetation, soil and 
agricultural land use. 
Accordingly, planning, fund allocation and execution of schemes is being 
carried out based on AEU approach from 2020-21 onwards. Among the schemes 
being implemented by Agriculture Development and Farmers’ Welfare Department, 
crop based and area specific schemes has been identified as AEU specific schemes. 
275 
The KAU has also developed AEU based package of practices recommendations as 
a part of prescribing climate resilient agriculture. 
7.4. Annual plan scheme document 
The budget document published every year after budget speech contain the 
details of annual plan document of the coming year which include plan write up, name 
of schemes, budget provisions, etc. The number of schemes, components, budget 
provision may vary every year. Once the budget document is released, the department 
will communicate the annual plan document of the coming year which are available 
in budget document as a hardcopy and also through website every year.  The annual 
plan document contains list of schemes and plan write up of each schemes, head of 
accounts, budget provisions, etc. 
7.5. Administrative sanction/ Continuance sanction of Scheme 
 
For every scheme/ proposal, it is first necessary to obtain the concurrence of 
the administrative department concerned. The formal acceptance by the 
administrative department in Government is termed “administrative sanction” of the 
scheme/ proposal. A scheme will be in force only after getting administrative 
sanction/ continuance sanction. 
As soon as the State budget document for the particular financial year is 
released/published, based on annual plan write up, the planning wing in the 
Directorate of Agriculture Development and Farmers’ Welfare will prepare the 
proposals along with component wise details for all state plan schemes mentioned in 
the budget document. The suggestions received from the concerned implementing 
wing may also be considered in this regard.  
Among these, the Director of Agriculture will issue continuance sanction for 
those schemes which has got administrative sanctions from government during 
previous years and also where there is no change in the components and rate of 
assistance. All other scheme proposals prepared based on budget document will be 
submitted to Government with the approval of Director of agriculture for obtaining 
276 
administrative sanction. This will include new state plan schemes and also 
modifications if any in the existing schemes for which the State government sanction 
will be obtained. 
In the case of majority of Central Sector Schemes (CSS), the planning wing of 
the Directorate will prepare the annual action plan for the financial year of a particular 
scheme based on guidelines issued by Government of India. The suggestions from 
implementing wing and the experience in implementation of the scheme during 
previous year may also be considered in this regard.  The annual action plan thus 
prepared shall be submitted to GOI with the approval of Director of Agriculture. On 
receipt of administrative approval from GOI for the scheme, the planning wing shall 
prepare the scheme proposal with budget provisions, head of account from which 
amount has to be met, etc. and send to Government of Kerala for issue of State level 
administrative sanction/ fund release order. In case of some other central sector 
schemes like the National Project on Biogas Development and similar ones, based on 
the target assigned by the GOI, the scheme proposal with budget provisions, head of 
account from which amount has to be met, etc. shall be prepared by the planning wing 
in consultation with implementing wing and submitted to Government of Kerala for 
administrative sanction/fund release order. 
7.6. Working Instructions of Scheme 
Once the continuous sanction/administrative sanction/release order of a 
scheme is issued/received, planning wing will make available the same to the 
concerned implementing wing. Accordingly, the implementing wing will prepare and 
issue the working instructions of that scheme with the approval of Director of 
Agriculture. The working instructions may include detailed guidelines, subsidy 
norms/pattern, district wise physical and financial targets of each components/sub 
components, head of account, monitoring procedure, etc. required for the smooth 
implementation of the scheme. The area of the particular crop, potential/scope of 
cultivation, etc. will be taken in to account while fixing the district wise physical 
277 
targets. In the absence of continuance sanction/ administrative sanction, no working 
instructions of the scheme is issued.  
7.7. Implementation of Schemes 
The working instructions is an important document for the implementation of 
a particular scheme. Once the  working instructions is issued with the approval of 
Director of Agriculture, the  same will be forwarded to Principal Agricultural 
Officers/ Heads of offices under the direct control of Director of Agriculture via

SEED PRODUCTION PROTOCOL 
 
 
10.1. Registered Paddy Seed production 
In Kerala, there is an increase in demand for quality paddy seed due to the 
higher targeted Seed Replacement Ratio (SRR) and demand from farmers.  To meet 
the high demand, quality paddy seeds are produced in farmers’ fields under the 
strict supervision of the Agricultural Officers in addition to the production of quality 
paddy seeds in State Seed Farms. 
For this, foundation seed required for multiplication will be distributed to the 
selected farmers/padasekhara samithy by Kerala State Seed Development Authority 
(KSSDA) which is the nodal agency for procurement and marketing of the seed thus 
produced. Individual farmers up to 2 hectares can register for seed production. If the 
area exceeds 2 ha, registration may be permitted only in favour of the concerned 
Padasekhara Samithy.  
The Padasekhara samithy/ individual farmer should register as a ‘Registered 
Grower’ by remitting Rs.25/- under the head of account “0401-800-84-other services 
and services fees” by way of treasury chalan.  Application for registration in the 
prescribed form along with the treasury challan should be submitted to the State Seed 
Certification Agency i.e.; the Additional Director of Agriculture (CP), Directorate of 
Agricultural 
Development 
and 
Farmers’ 
Welfare, 
Vikas 
Bhavan, 
Thiruvananthapuram, 695033. 
The padasekhara samithy/individual farmer need to take membership with the 
KSSDA remitting a fee of Rs.2010/- and Rs.510/- respectively and should execute an 
agreement with KSSDA. The KSSDA will arrange to conduct necessary trainings to 
the padasekhara smithies and Officers. The training schedule should be chalked out 
by the KSSDA in consultation with the Principal Agricultural Officers.  
304 
The Agricultural Officer of the concerned Krishi Bhavan should ensure that 
the registered growers adopt all the scientific cultivation practices, in the area selected 
for paddy seed production. The Assistant Director of Agriculture at block level is 
designated as Seed Inspector and should conduct three field inspections in the 
prescribed format at particular time intervals as detailed below.  
 
Variety 
First Inspection 
Second Inspection 
Third Inspection 
Short duration 
Within 60 DAS 
Within 85 DAS 
Within 100 DAS 
Medium duration 
Within 80 DAS 
Within 100 DAS 
Within 125 DAS 
Long duration 
Within 90 DAS 
Within 125 DAS 
Within 150 DAS 
DAS – Days After Sowing 
 
The required details and the Field Inspection Reports should be sent to the 
Additional Director of Agriculture (CP) within 10 days of inspection. 
The Agricultural Officer should ensure that proper drying and precleaning of 
harvested paddy is done before the drawal of seed samples by the Assistant Director of 
Agriculture. As envisaged in the Seed Act (1966), the Seed Inspector, (the Assistant 
Director of Agriculture) should inspect and draw samples of seed lot produced by the 
registered seed growers.  
On receipt of the sample, the Seed Analyst will conduct the analysis of seed 
samples and furnish the test results. On receipt of test results of seed samples, the seed 
inspector should furnish the same along with the duly filled proforma for this purpose 
to the Additional Director of Agriculture (CP). On receipt of all the required details, 
the Additional Director of Agriculture (CP) will issue the “certification tag” within 10 
days of receipt of the requisition from the seed inspector.  The Certificate of 
Registration will be communicated to the concerned Seed Inspector, Principal 
Agricultural Officer of the district and KSSDA. 
Immediately after the receipt of certification tag, KSSDA will make 
arrangement for the processing, packing and lifting of the certified seed with necessary 
305 
labelling. The KSSDA, in consultation with the concerned Principal Agricultural 
Officer will see that the certified seed produced in the district will be distributed to 
meet the demand of that particular district and the balance quantity will be transported 
to the godown/ware house. 
  Since the quality of the FS II seeds produced in the State Seed Farms decide 
the quality of certified seed produced by registered seed growers, utmost care should 
be taken in the production of foundation seeds.  Since seed is declared as a commodity 
under the Essential Commodities Act, the seed produced and distributed should possess 
the assured quality for which the above guidelines should compulsorily be adhered to. 
Hence the above guide lines are applicable to paddy seed production in departmental 
seed farms also. 
10.2. Procurement/production of coconut seed nuts  
The department is procuring quality WCT/dwarf seed nuts and producing 
hybrid seed nuts for raising quality coconut seedlings in departmental coconut 
nurseries/farms. For this, WCT seed nuts are procured from the farmers’ fields of 
Kozhikode, Thrissur and Kannur districts and also from Seed Garden Complex 
(SGC), Munderi whereas hybrid seed nuts are produced and procured from farmers’ 
fields of Thrissur, Malappuram and Kannur districts and from SGC, Munderi. MYD 
variety of coconut is procured from SGC, Munderi, Malappuram.  
 
10.2.1. Procurement of WCT/Dwarf coconut seed nuts  
 
The procedure to be followed for the procurement of quality WCT/dwarf 
coconut seed nuts are summarized as follows; 
10.2.1.1. Selection of mother palms. 
Coconut gardens having palms with the record of consistently high yield and 
containing high proportion of heavy bearers and situated under average conditions 
without heavy manuring or irrigation and free from pests and diseases are to be 
selected. The willingness of the garden owners must be obtained. The selection of 
306 
mother palms and procurement of seed nuts are as per the guidelines given in the 
Manual for Coconut Nurseries in Kerala/Package of Practices of Kerala Agricultural 
University. 
10.2.1.2. Numbering of gardens and palms. 
The Agricultural Assistants engaged in the selection of mother palms will first 
inspect all the trees in a selected garden. The trees are identified and marked.  Then the 
mother palms so identified in each garden are given a circular band with yellow paint 
(5 cm width) around the tree at a height of about 1.5 M above the ground level so that 
the mother palms can be located from any part of the garden.  The serial numbers of 
the trees and the garden numbers are to be written with red paint on a yellow circular 
background with a diameter of 15 cm on the band.  As far as possible the numbering 
is done in the side facing the entrance of the garden. Tree numbers are written on the 
top and garden number below. 
Eg:- Tr No. 
        G.No 
 
For banding and numbering, semi-skilled labourers are employed.  The 
Agricultural Assistants make sure that the painting of band around the palms and 
numbering are done neatly and legibly by these labourers. 
On completion of the above work, the details are recorded in a mother palm 
register on the same day itself by the Agricultural Assistant. All the information 
required about the garden are entered in the mother palm register and entries attested 
by him.  The Agricultural Officer in charge of the region inspects all the mother palms 
selected by the Agricultural Assistant and any undesirable tree selected as mother palm 
is rejected.  The rejected tree number is rounded with red ink in the mother palm 
register. 
It should be borne in mind that only a reasonable percentage of rejection is 
allowable and if too much of rejection in the selected palms are noticed, the concerned 
official will be held personally responsible for it. 
307 
Marking of the mother palms starts from 1st November and is completed before 
31st December every year. Before marking the mother palms in a selected garden, the 
consent of the owners is obtained in writing for supplying seed nuts as per the 
conditions specified and the price fixed by the Department. 
10.2.1.3. Harvesting of seed nuts. 
Harvest of seed nuts starts from the 1st week of January and is completed before 
31st May. During this period 2 –3 rounds of harvest is taken so as to obtain 10 nuts in 
the first round and10-15 nuts in the second and third rounds.  Single fully ripe bunch 
is harvested at a time.  Before the harvest, it must be ensured that the nuts are fully 
matured and the husks are not dried up. The seed nuts selected should be above 11 
months old and it should be ensured that all bunches are carefully lowered using rope.  
The Agricultural Assistants prepare the abstract of the relevant gardens allotted 
to them in the field note book from the mother palm register.  While conducting harvest 
the particulars of harvest of each mother palm are recorded in this note book then and 
there.  This notebook is produced at the time of inspection by the Agricultural Officer 
during harvest.   
After daily harvest, the Agricultural Assistants physically verify the total 
number of nuts recorded in the field note book.  This must tally in all the cases.  The 
Agricultural Assistants post their entries in the mother palm register maintained in the 
office on the same day itself.  Under no circumstances, this should be postponed.  Over 
writing or erasing is to be avoided both in the field note book and in the mother palm 
register. 
10.2.1.4. Selection of seed nuts       
Only fully matured, medium sized, husked nut weighing not less than about 
600g and spherical or oblong in size and shape are selected so as to ensure selection of 
good quality seed nuts.  Undersized and oversized nuts are rejected by the Agricultural 
Assistants at the time of inspection of harvest and also while loading the seed nuts in 
lorry for despatch. 
308 
 Selection of nuts is done by engaging skilled labourers.  But the selection is 
done only in the presence of the Agricultural Assistants who are directly responsible 
for the quality of the nuts selected.  
10.2.1.5. Sealing of seed nuts 
The nuts are sealed using sealing hammers on the entire segment at the distal 
end soon after selection. The seed nuts without sealing are rejected and returned to the 
procurement centres. 
Sealing hammers with distinguishing marks are provided to each Agricultural 
Assistant and they are responsible for safe custody. If the seed nuts are to be rejected, 
the sealing is cancelled by sealing cross wise over the seal already marked. 
10.2.1.6. Supervision 
The Agricultural Officers and Agricultural Assistants in charge of the 
programme are responsible for selection of mother palms. They supervise all activities 
connected with the selection and procurement of nuts, transportation etc.  All the palms 
selected under the programme are inspected by both Agricultural Assistants and 
Agricultural Officers. The Assistant Director of Agriculture in charge of the 
procurement programme closely monitors the implementation of the programme. The 
Deputy Director of Agriculture (YP) and the Principal Agricultural Officer monitor the 
programme at district level and the Additional Director of Agriculture (Farms) at state 
level. 
10.2.2. Hybrid Coconut Seed nuts Production  
The hybrid coconut seed nuts are produced by inter-varietal crosses between 
tall and dwarf forms of coconut palms. Hybrid coconut seed nuts are produced by 
controlled pollination using tall and dwarf varieties of palms as parents. In case of 
TxD hybrid, the tall variety is the female parent and the dwarf variety is the male 
parent. In case of D xT hybrids, the dwarf variety is the female parent and the tall 
variety is the male parent. The hybrids have shorter pre-bearing period and high 
bearing capacity. They start bearing from the 4th year of planting, have high annual 
309 
yield of about 90-110 nuts per palm and produce good quality copra with an oil 
content of about 65-69%.  
Under the department, the hybridization work for TxD/ DxT seed nut production 
is carried out in four districts viz., Thrissur, Malappuram, Kannur and Kasaragod under 
supervision of the seed procurement unit /farms. 
10.2.2.1. Techniques of hybrid seednut production  
 
In tall variety palms, the female phase usually begins 22 days after the spathe 
has opened and lasts for 4-6 days whereas the male phase extends for 16-22 days. 
There is a gap of 2-3 days between male and female phases in these varieties. 
However, in dwarf varieties, the male and female phases overlap, resulting in self-
pollination. 
The selection of mother palms for hybridization and production of hybrid seed 
nuts is done as per the guidelines/ recommendations in the Manual for Coconut 
Nurseries in Kerala/   Package of Practices, Kerala Agricultural University. 
All the palms selected are periodically inspected by both Agricultural Officers 
and Agricultural Assistants.  The Assistant Director of Agriculture/Senior 
Agricultural Officer in charge of the procurement programme closely supervises and 
inspects the palms selected and rejections are made if required. The Deputy Director 
of Agriculture (YP) is in charge of the scheme at district level and the Principal 
Agricultural Officers of the district inspect the palms/garden selected for 
hybridization.    
10.2.2.2. Major equipments required 
 
i. Pollination Bag: To protect the receptive female flowers from pollinating 
agents, cotton cloth bags of 75 cm x 50 cm size, having a transparent plastic 
window (to view the receptive stage of female flowers) are used as pollination 
bags. 
ii. Desiccator: Pollen is usually stored in a desiccator with fused calcium chloride 
as desiccant. The pollen is collected in small vials, plugged with non-absorbent 
cotton and kept in desiccator.  
310 
iii. Applicator for spraying pollen grains: When the rubber bulb is pressed, the 
pollen applicator pumps air into the squeeze bottle and the pollen-chalk mixture 
inside the bottle is released as a cloud, into the pollination bag. 
10.2.2.3. Collection of pollens 
 
Male flowers are collected from the male parental palms before opening of 
individual male flowers, usually 2-4 days after the opening of inflorescence. These 
mature male flowers are placed in between two sheets of newspaper and slightly 
crushed using a wooden rolling pin to separate the perianth parts. The crushed male 
flowers are dried in shade for 1-2 days. On completion of drying, the pollen is 
collected by sieving the dried male flowers using a sieve with mesh size of 0.2 mm. 
Pollen is preserved in desiccator to maintain its viability. 
 
10.2.2.4. Emasculation and Bagging 
 
Emasculation is usually done by cutting the spikelet 5 cm above the female 
flowers using a secateurs / knife. The male flowers seen in between or near the female 
flowers are removed by hand. Dwarf parental palms are emasculated within 3-5 days 
of opening of the inflorescence. Bagging is done to prevent pollination in emasculated 
inflorescence by natural means and is done a few days before the female flowers 
become receptive. Bagging is done 3-4 days before the initiation of female phase in 
an inflorescence. 
10.2.2.5. Method of artificial pollination 
 
The pollen grains are usually mixed with a suitable diluent like purified talc 
and filled in the applicator. A small hole is made on the plastic sheet and the tube of 
the pollen applicator is inserted through this hole and the pollen-chalk mixture is 
sprayed inside the pollination bag. The above process is repeated till all the female 
flowers in an inflorescence become receptive. After spraying the pollen-chalk 
mixture, the hole is closed using an adhesive tape. The most ideal time for carrying 
out artificial pollination is during the morning hours, 7 am to 11 am. When all the 
311 
buttons in an inflorescence attain the stage when stigma turns brown and the secretion 
of nectar stops, the pollination bag is removed and the bunch labelled. 
 
10.2.2.6. Collection of seed nuts 
 
The time of seed nut collection may vary from region to region according to 
the seasonal conditions. Nuts with proper shape and size only are selected; any type 
of damage of the nut during harvesting is avoided. The nuts are lowered by ropes 
only, to get an undamaged embryo, the presence of water is judged by shaking the 
nuts and getting clear metallic sound on tapping. Fully matured nuts will have dry 
husks with a distinct browning of the inner fibres. Gurgling sound of water within the 
nut can be heard on shaking them. 
10.2.2.7. Supervision 
Hybrid seed nut production units for DxT/TxD production with 100 dwarf 
palms each are functioning at field level under Chavakkad unit in Thrissur and 
Malappuram districts. The activities are supervised by the Assistant Director of 
Agriculture (CD), Thrissur. Additional pollination workers if any required, are 
selected and trained by Assistant Director of Agriculture (CD) Chavakkad. At Seed 
Garden Complex, Munderi, the Deputy Director of Agriculture supervises 
hybridization works after selecting maximum number of dwarf mother palm for 
pollination.  
In Malappuram district, the Deputy Director of Agriculture (YP) co-ordinates 
the hybridization and procurement activities along with the Assistant Director of 
Agriculture (CD), Thrissur and the Deputy Director of Agriculture, SGC, Munderi. 
The pollination workers of Model Hybridization Centre, Chalode carry out the TxD 
hybridization work at Kannur and Kasaragod districts under the supervision of Senior 
Agricultural Officer, Model Hybridization Centre, Chalode, Kannur (District).         
The Deputy Director of Agriculture (YP) and the Principal Agricultural Officers 
of the districts shall monitor the programme at district level and the Additional Director 
of Agriculture (Farms) at state level.

GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES CERTIFICATION 
PROTOCOL 
 
 
 
11.0. Introduction 
 
The Good Agricultural Practices refers to a totality of an emerging agricultural 
consciousness popularly abbreviated as GAP practices that address environmental, 
economic and social sustainability for on-farm processes that result in safe and quality 
food and non-food agriculture products. The economic viability, environmental 
sustainability social acceptability and food safety / quality form the four pillars of 
GAP. India has recently adopted the GAP codes, standards and regulations and it is 
hoped that it can contribute to sustainable agriculture and rural development.  
 
11.1. Cluster Formation and Registration 
 
Any farmer with not less than 20 cents of land and farmers’ groups of not less 
than five members having minimum one acre of owned/ leased land cultivating fruit 
and vegetable  identified by the Agricultural Officer register themselves in the Krishi 
Bhavan for GAP certification. The lead farmer in each cluster will carry out the group 
activities. Implementation of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) or Organic 
cultivation practices in fruit and vegetable cultivation is voluntary and non-
discriminatory to all the farmers. GAP should be strictly followed by the cluster in 
the cultural operations.  
11.2. Farm Documentation 
All the crop production activities (eg. dates and other details of planting, 
planting materials, input application, irrigation source, harvest, sale details etc.) shall 
be recorded in the farm diary provided to the farmers. The inspecting officers will 
check the field diary and record their observations.  
314 
11.3. Monitoring and certification 
A four tier system of monitoring shall be implemented from the farmer level.  
The various tiers in monitoring are as follows. 
1. Documentation and self-evaluation by the farmer based on prescribed 
check list. 
2. a. Peer appraisal of organic farm in every cropping season by Peer 
Appraisal Group 
b. Internal inspection of all farmers practicing GAP by field level               
functionaries like Agricultural Assistants, Field Assistants, Pest               
Scouts. 
3. Evaluation of all reports by the Agricultural Officer. The Assistant 
Director of Agriculture may randomly inspect the selected sample of 
farmers. 
4. Evaluation, correction and final certification. 
5. Monitoring and certification by Assistant Director of Agriculture (M). 
11.4. Documentation and self-evaluation by the farmer 
There should be documentary evidence to prove that internal self-assessment 
of the various activities is carried out as suggested by a competent authority during 
the course of cultivation.  The farmer should see that such recording and 
documentation are done. Effective corrective actions taken as a result of non-
conformity detected during the internal self-assessment are recorded for further 
evaluation. Such documents are kept for a period of not less than one year and is made 
available to field level functionaries and certification officials as and when needed.  
11.5. Internal auditing by peer groups 
A peer group constituted comprising of leaders of all the farmer groups 
registered in a Krishi Bhavan under this scheme take care of the various group 
activities like procurement of inputs, training, auditing of activities under taken by 
individual farmers and groups, and assist them to get the technical support of Krishi 
Bhavan. The peer group conduct visits to individual plots once in a fortnight and 
315 
verify the compliance of various requirements and help the farmers to keep necessary 
records in order. 
11.6. Monitoring, supervision and reporting by the field level functionaries 
The field level functionaries like Agricultural Assistants, Field Assistants and 
Pest scouts inspect the plots at least once in a week during the entire crop period and 
verify the documents and records maintained by them. They inspect the plots, crop 
situation and pest and disease incidence and report the matter to the Agricultural 
Officer for necessary action. They supervise the technical activities where the farmer 
demands more support like soil sampling, compost making, soil solarisation etc. They 
help the farmer in correcting non-conformities as suggested by the Agricultural 
Officer. They assist the Agricultural Officers to implement the programme 
effectively. Date of inspection, recommendations given, nonconformities corrected 
and all the related activities are entered in the Field Diary. 
11.7. Evaluation, correction and certification by the Agricultural Officer 
The Agricultural Officers in the Krishi Bhavans are the Inspectors, who with 
the support of Agricultural Assistants carry out inspection of the crop management 
activities undertaken by the farmers through records maintained by the farmers and 
also by site inspection once or twice before the harvest. The recording by the 
Agricultural Officers are done based on compliance with the standards specified. 
They recommend to certify the organic status of products if the standards specified 
has been complied with.  
As the competent authority for certification of safe to eat agricultural produce, 
the Agricultural officer have all the freedom for inspection of plots, evaluation, 
suggesting corrections in case of non-conformities. He/she inspect the plot once or 
twice during the crop period to see that the cultivation is done as per the requirements 
of certification.  He/she takes necessary steps to insure the crop against natural 
calamities. He appraises the reports generated by the field functionaries and suggest 
suitable remedial measures to solve the problem. Those problems which require 
attention from scientists are reported to them. 
316 
The Agricultural Officer organizes training programmes as and when needed 
or demanded. He/she suggests suitable control measures and see that the chemicals 
are applied as directed and waiting periods are observed before harvesting.  He /she 
draws random samples for test on pesticide residues. Based on the field and lab 
reports and records maintained by the farmers, he/she certifies the farm for the 
adoption of GAP practices as per the requirements of standards which is valid for one 
year. He/she recommends to issue the safe to eat certificate to the products produced 
by the concerned group or an individual farmer to the higher authorities at district 
level through the controlling officer. 
Certification will be done purely on merit and it is the sole discretion of the 
competent authority based on documentary evidences, records, reports and test 
results. Certified products are provided a separate logo and are branded under the 
brand name – ‘Kerala Organic” and can be marketed through ecoshops, local markets, 
weekly markets, etc. at a premium price. Only certified farmers and their products 
can use the safe to eat brand for markets.  
 11.8. Monitoring and certification at District Level 
 
The Principal Agricultural Officers at district level have overall control of the 
programme. The Deputy Directors of Agriculture (NWDPRA) will be the District

supervision of a person with degree in Agriculture/ Diploma in agriculture 
from Kerala Agricultural University/VHSE (Agriculture). Private nurseries 
functioning well in this field for the last 5 years will be eligible for obtaining 
licence without satisfying this condition. 
2. The nurseries should have a scientifically laid out progeny orchard. The mother 
plants used for propagation should have good quality and should be bought 
from authentic sources. These mother plants should be labelled so as to identify 
the varieties and proper management practices should always be adopted in 
progeny orchard to ensure the health of mother plants. The block level 
Assistant Director of Agriculture in the concerned area should visit the progeny 
orchard at least once in a month and see to it that if mother plants are found 
unsuitable due to any of the reasons given below should not be used further for 
318 
propagation. Such mother plants should be subjected to quarantine and if 
pest/disease incidence is found to increase dangerously, that should be 
destroyed at the expense of the person in charge of nursery. 
The situations for declaring mother plants unsuitable;  
i. 
If the agricultural produce obtained is of low quality 
ii. 
If poor/ irregular yield is obtained 
iii. 
If pest/disease incidence is  above manageable level 
iv. 
If they do not possess the qualities prescribed for the respective items. 
v. 
If the responsible official is sure that there is some other reason based 
on public interest 
3. If seeds and rhizome/tubers are used for the production of planting materials, 
the same should be purchased from Government farms/ Kerala Agricultural 
University/ Government Research stations. If it is not available in required 
quantity, seeds/mother plants of assured quality can be purchased from other 
sources under orders of the Director of Agriculture. This condition must be 
observed in the case of pepper vines bought from external sources for 
production of rooted pepper cuttings.

of land in corporation area, 20 cents in municipalities and 50 cents in 
panchayats. 
ii) Necessary infrastructure for irrigation should be arranged in nurseries. 
iii) An office building must be there inside the nursery for proper 
administration of the nursery and keeping the records safely. 
6. Authentic documents for establishing the quality and place of collection of 
mother plants grown in progeny orchard and the purity, quality and place of 
collection of seeds bought for seedling production, etc. should be maintained. 
7. The following registers should be kept / maintained in the nurseries. 
a) Register of Agricultural operations: A register for recording quantity of 
seeds used for planting material production, planting details, agricultural 
operations carried out, number of germinated seedlings, number of planting 
material produced and number of non-standard planting materials rejected, 
etc. should be maintained. 
b) Stock Register: A stock register showing item wise details of planting 
material produced in the nursery should be maintained. Number of 
seedlings produced and number of planting materials distributed should be 
entered promptly and also stock balance must be recorded daily by the 
person in charge of the nursery.  
c) Sales Register 
The price and other details of planting materials sold each day should be 
recorded in this register. 
d) Inspection Register 
A register should be maintained in the office building for recording the 
instructions of the authorised officials visiting the nursery. Action taken 
in response to the directions issued by the inspecting officer should also 
be recorded in this register. 
 
320 
8. Granting approval for quality of planting material 
It is the duty of the block level Assistant Director of Agriculture to issue 
licence to the private nursery after checking the quality of planting material 
produced in the nursery. He/she should inspect the nursery at least once a 
month and assess the quality and purity of each variety raised in the nursery. 
The quality of each batch of planting material should be recorded in the register 
before starting the sale. While issuing the certificate, the name of the variety, 
number of planting material raised in the nursery and number of planting 
material of prescribed quality produced, etc. should be recorded.  The nursery 
supervisor is bound to keep the certificate as a record in the nursery. 
The person in charge of nursery is bound to destroy planting materials 
which do not have prescribed quality as directed by the Assistant Director of 
Agriculture in his/her presence. The planting material should not at any cost be 
sold without obtaining certificate of quality. 
9. Each sales outlet should have separate stock register and cash bills with counter 
foil. Variety/ item wise price list of planting materials should be exhibited in 
each sales outlet. 
10. Other conditions 
i. It is the sole responsibility of nursery supervisor to sell out the planting 
material that are produced in the nursery. 
ii. If directed by Department of Agriculture Development and Farmers’ 
Welfare, these nurseries should participate in agricultural fairs conducted by

MANAGEMENT OF PEST/DISEASE INCIDENCE/OUTBREAK  
AND  
ROLE OF DEPARTMENT IN DISASTER MANAGEMENT 
 
13.1. Management of pest/disease incidence/outbreak 
 
13.1.1. Introduction 
 
The farmers and consumers need healthy plants and quality plant products for 
consumption. Efforts to improve plant health have been evolving with increased 
understanding of plant ecology and pest management. The incidence of pest and 
diseases in crops can be found out by continuous monitoring of the pest population 
and weather parameters. This will help the farmers in taking up prophylactic 
management measures as well as integrated pest management for the control of pest 
and diseases. 
13.1.2. Management of pest/disease 
13.1.2.1. Krishi Bhavan level 
When a pest/disease incidence/outbreak is noticed/reported, the preliminary 
investigation including sample collection will be conducted by the Agricultural 
Officer/Agricultural Field Officer in the concerned Krishi Bhavan. He/she will inform 
the Principal Agricultural Officer about the occurrence of the outbreak in time. If the 
Agricultural Officer is confident about the cause of the disease or has identified the 
pest, he/she will advise farmers about the steps to be taken to control the spread of 
the disease/pest. Otherwise as per the recommendation of the Multi-Disciplinary 
Diagnostic Team (MDDT), the Agricultural Officer should advise farmers about the 
nature of the disease/pest, the control measure proposed and the steps to be taken to 
control the spread of the disease/pest. For the effective control of outbreaks, the 
324 
Agricultural Officer should seek the co-operation of the local bodies, public and other 
department officials.  
13.1.2.2. District Level 
 
In each district, there is a Multi-Disciplinary Diagnostic Team (MDDT) for 
monitoring and to recommend and undertake timely action in the event of sudden 
pest/disease outbreak in any part of the district on a war footing. The Multi-
Disciplinary District Diagnostic Team at district level includes; 
i. Deputy Director of Agriculture (WM) as team leader  
ii. Deputy Director of Agriculture (E &T)  
iii. Scientists from the RARS of the area /KAU) and  
iv. Scientist from CPCRI/CTCRI (members)  
When there is pest/disease outbreak, the Multi-Disciplinary Diagnostic Team 
(MDDT) will visit the area to undertake advance action and recommend suitable 
control measures. A copy of the report of MDDT will be sent to the Director of 
Agriculture along with specific and genuine report of the Principal Agricultural 
Officer including the claim amount certified by him/her. The report should also 
include the name of pest/disease affecting the crop, total area of crop affected, control 
measures recommended, name and quantity of chemical required, mode of 
application, application cost required, etc.  
13.1.2.3. State Level 
On receipt of the report of the Principal Agricultural Officer along with the 
report of MDDT, the Rapid Action Wing at the state level, under the leadership of the 
Joint Director of Agriculture (PP) in Directorate of Agriculture Development and 
Farmers’ Welfare, if required will visit the area and decide the control measures and 
recommend for the financial assistance to take up control measures. The financial 
assistance recommended include the expenses involved in adoption of control 
measures on emergency basis, cost of fungicides/pesticides/ bio control agents and 
other inputs including operational charges. The Director of Agriculture will sanction 
the amount from the provision set apart for this purpose. The remedial /control 
325 
measures should be undertaken on a community basis ensuring maximum co-
operation of farmers affected.  
13.1.3. Kerala Centre for Pest Management 
The Kerala Centre for Pest Management (KCPM), is a pest/disease 
surveillance unit is functioning under the Department of Agriculture Development 
and Farmers’ Welfare, at Mancompu, Alappuzha for helping farmers of Kuttanad 
area with timely intervention during pest/disease incidence. This centre 
undertakes pest and disease surveillance in paddy fields by adopting scientific 
techniques, fixed plot survey, rapid rowing survey, such as light trap 
observation, etc. which helps in the early detection of pests and diseases. The 
intervention by this centre also resulted in reduced pesticide consumption in 
paddy cultivation in Kuttanad. This centre also acts as an agency for co-
ordinating the crop health management programmes of the department along 
with ATMA. 
13.1.4. The Crop Pest Surveillance System 
 
 
The Crop Pest Surveillance System (CPSS) is a web and mobile based, 
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) enabled pest surveillance 
information system developed and implemented by Indian Institute of Information 
Technology and Management - Kerala (IIITM-K) for the Department of Agriculture 
Development and Farmers’ Welfare to identify the symptoms and diagnose insect 
pest attack, diseases and nutritional deficiencies/physiological disorders in various 
crops. Here, the location specific data on pest surveillance will be captured and stored 
in centralized database for easy access and retrieval. This time series data is being 
used for preparing the prediction and advisory services. 
The pest/disease surveillance data is captured by field level extension officers 
by using an integrated mobile application deployed in smart phone device /tablets and 
uploaded to the centralized server. For each crop, there are two fixed plots of uniform 
326 
size in each panchayat for sampling and recording observations. Moreover, a roving 
survey is conducted in a transect manner in the panchayat and observations are 
recorded. Based on the field level data, the system generates pest severity reports for 
the extension officers and researchers and necessary advisories for the farmers on a 
near-real time basis. The reports are being generated location wise, panchayat wise 
and block wise for easy navigation and interpretation.  
The system generates mobile SMS alerts and sends to farmers and respective 
Agricultural extension officers/ scientists so that they can immediately attend the 
issues. The system also provides the facility to send mobile SMS and 
recommendations by the concerned Agricultural Officers to their respective 
registered farmers.  
In CPSS, there are two components viz; self-diagnosis through image based 
assistance for identification of pest and diseases and assisted diagnosis through 
general identification details of pest and diseases. The CPSS provides general 
Information on pest, diseases and nutrient deficiency details and their control 
measures will be displayed in a table format. Further selection on the table details will 
provide more information like symptoms, procedure for observation, ETL and control 
measures. This online system help the farming community through an interactive 
model and take suitable control measures on time. Quality images and videos have 
been included to provide more help for the farming community 
13.2. Role of department in disaster management 
One of the main functions of the department is to protect farmers from risk 
factors through appropriate relief measures. On submission of duly filled application 
in time, assistance at the rates ordered by Government from time to time will be 
provided to the farmers whose crops were affected/lost due to natural calamity. The 
procedures to be followed while crop loss occurred due to natural calamity are 
detailed below; 
 
 
327 
13.2.1. Reporting of crop loss and sanctioning of assistance for crop loss due to 
natural calamity 
 
Once crop loss occurs due to natural calamity, the Agricultural 
Officer/Agricultural Field Officer or Agricultural Assistants in Krishi Bhavan must 
inspect the site/area immediately/on the same day itself. Accordingly, a preliminary 
report in the prescribed proforma will be prepared and submitted to Principal 
Agricultural Officer within 24 hrs, with a copy to concerned Assistant Director of

Consequently, the duly filled applications from all the affected farmers should 
be collected. It may be noted that the duly filled application submitted within 10 days 
from the date of occurrence of the natural calamity is considered for assistance. Under 
special circumstances, Government can extend the last date of receipt of duly filled 
application in Krishi Bhavans. If the natural calamity is badly affected in the larger 
area of the panchayat and crop loss is very severe, the area should also be inspected 
328 
by concerned Assistant Director of Agriculture/Deputy Director of Agriculture in 
HQ/Principal Agricultural Officer. 
On receipt of the applications, the Agricultural Assistants should conduct field 
verification and record the extent of damage in the applications. The Agricultural 
Officer/Agricultural Field Officer alone or jointly with Agricultural Assistant should 
also verify the applications even though the same was recommended. The 
Agricultural Officer/Agricultural Field Officer should invariably sanction each and 
every applications with eligible amount of assistance, if the sanctioned amount is 
under his/her delegation as per the orders from time to time.   
Once the applications are sanctioned by the Agricultural Officer, the claim in 
triplicate to the Principal Agricultural Officer will be prepared by the Assistant 
Agricultural Officer/Senior most Agricultural Assistant based on the statements and 
applications from other Agricultural Assistants. The claim thus prepared by Assistant 
Agricultural Officer/Senior most Agricultural Assistant will be submitted to Principal 
Agricultural Officer after the authentication by the Agricultural Officer/Agricultural 
Field Officer through concerned Assistant Director of Agriculture. 
It may also be noted that, if the eligible assistance found to be above the 
sanctioning limit of Agricultural Officer/Agricultural Field Officer, a separate claim 
statement need to be prepared separately, recommended and submitted to appropriate 
level for sanction along with applications. For detailed guidelines, refer the scheme 
documents issued from time to time.  
Since the department has introduced SMART software for online processing 
of the applications of farmers with respect to crop loss due to natural calamity as a 
part of AIMS, the data uploaded by farmers/from Krishi Bhavans will be processed 
at each level electronically and forwarded to higher-ups through online. As and when 
the funds are allotted/released, the eligible assistance will be disbursed/credited to the 
bank account of the beneficiaries.

13.2.2. Crop loss compensation to farmers under State Crop Insurance Scheme 
 
 
Agriculture is highly susceptible to risks due to natural calamities like 
droughts, floods, etc. It is necessary to protect the farmers’ crops from natural 
calamities and ensure a reasonable support for the next season. For this purpose, the 
Government introduced State Crop Insurance Scheme throughout the Kerala at a low 
premium covering 27 crops at present. Both farmers cultivating crops in own land 
and in leased land are eligible to enrol under State Crop Insurance Scheme. Under the 
scheme, the farmers are eligible for getting benefit only from one week after the 
payment of premium and for total loss of crops. 
This scheme covers the crop loss due to natural disasters, such as drought, 
floods, landslides, earthquakes, sea erosion, cyclone, thunderstorm, lightning, forest 
fire and wild animal attack. The farmers enrolled under the scheme should submit the 
application in prescribed form within 15 days of occurrence of natural calamity along 
with policy certificate. On receipt of the same, within 5 days, the Agricultural 
Assistants should conduct field verification and record the damage. Consequently, 
the Agricultural Officer/Agricultural Field Officer should invariably sanction each 
and every applications with eligible amount of assistance, if the sanctioned amount is 
under his/her delegation as per the orders from time to time.  
Once the applications are sanctioned, claim statement to Principal Agricultural 
Officer will be prepared by the Assistant Agricultural Officer/Senior most 
Agricultural Assistant based on the statements from other Agricultural Assistants. 
The same will be submitted to higher-ups after authentication by the Agricultural 
Officer/Agricultural Field Officer through concerned Assistant Director of 
Agriculture. For detailed guidelines, refer the scheme documents issued from time to 
time.  
Since the department has introduced SMART software from 2019 onwards for 
online processing of the applications of farmers under State Crop Insurance Scheme 
as a part of AIMS, the data uploaded by farmers / from Krishi Bhavans will be 
processed at each level electronically and forwarded to higher-ups through online. As 
330 
and when the funds are allotted/released, the eligible assistance will be 
disbursed/credited to the bank account of the beneficiaries. At present, the application 
for State Crop Insurance Scheme policy is also processed online through AIMS 
portal.

14.5.1.Steps to be taken by the officials  
    
The Advocate General (AG) office should be requested to send the photocopy 
of the petition along with all annexures. If the Court asks for an instruction, 
respondents should submit it in time otherwise, in the absence of instructions the 
Court may pass interim order on the next hearing date.  Such situations should be 
avoided. 
 
In case Court asks Government Pleader (GP) to take notice for the respondents, 
respondents should file counter affidavit within 90 days after receipt of notice or with 
in such shorter time as the courts directs.  For this, respondents should submit a 
statement of facts with copies of all relevant records either directly to the Advocate 
General.  On receipt of statement of facts, GP prepares counter affidavit (CA) and 
gives it back to the respondents for signing.  After signing CA by the respondents, it 
should be submitted to AG's Office without delay.  If respondents fail to file CA within 
the stipulated period, the court may treat interim order as a final order.  Such situations 
should be avoided. 
        For speedy disposal of the case, it is better to file counter affidavit at the earliest 
as possible without waiting for 3 months or up to the time frame fixed by the court. 
 
Once the case is disposed by the court, the respondents have to act as per the 
judgement after receipt of the copy of the judgement either from the AG's office or 
334 
from the party.  If we are not in a position to complete the procedure within the 
prescribed time, an extension petition shall be filed prior to the completion of the time 
granted.  The request for filing extension petition shall be in a letter form. It should 
contain the date of receipt of judgement, action taken after receipt of judgement, 
specific reason for not complying with the order and how much time is required for 
complying with the order.  The request for filing extension petition should be 
addressed to AG and shall be sent directly to the AG. 
 
If the Department is not satisfied with the judgement, the officer concerned 
shall personally contact Government Pleader (GP) and take necessary steps for filing 
appeal.  The first step is to be get legal opinion from the Law Officer, concerned GP 
and then with the approval of AG, the GP files appeal.  For this purpose, all relevant 
documents should be submitted to GP. 
 
The appeal should be filed within the stipulated time.  Otherwise, delay 
condonation petition is also to be submitted along with the appeal.  The delay 
condonation petition should be signed by the concerned officer.  If the respondents 
have neither filed appeal nor compiled with the judgement, the court can take action 
against the respondents for contempt of court. 
14.5.2. Writ Appeal 
 
The writ appeal should be filed within 30 days on receipt of the judgement.  If 
delay occurs, a delay condonation petition has to be filed.  Along with delay 
condonation petition, an affidavit showing the reasons for delay should be filed by 
the concerned officer.  Appeal is usually prepared by the government pleader, 
however, the supporting documents to be attached along with the appeal should be 
provided by the Appellant (Officer concerned from department)  He should take 
follow up measures to make sure that the appeal is filed in time.  If appeal is filed by 
the party, the Officer concerned has to file Counter affidavit on intimation from the 
AG's office.  If the judgement in appeal case is against the Government's interest, the 
Department shall file Special Leave Petition (SLP) in Supreme Court with the 
permission of the Government.

14.5.3. Miscellaneous First Appeal (MFA) 
 
 
Miscellaneous First Appeal is filed against the orders in OA (Original 
Application) filed before Tribunal. Once the judgement is proclaimed by the tribunal, 
respondents shall apply for the judgement copy and also for the documents mentioned 
as Appendix in the judgement.  If the department wants to file Appeal the respondent 
should submit a copy of the judgement together with documents mentioned as 
Appendix and legal opinion of AG.  In non-appealing cases, the above documents 
should be obtained and kept ready in the file.  If party files appeal, the above 
documents should be submitted to AG for filing counter affidavit. 
 
After the proclamation of judgement, the respondent (department officer) 
should apply for the certified copy of the judgement and documents mentioned in 
annexures of the judgement.  These documents have to be submitted to AG along with 
a request for filing appeal.  In the case of party filed appeal, such documents are to be 
procured and produced to AG if called for.  If you have not taken the copies of 
documents mentioned in the annexure of the judgement, it may be unavailable if

Vth standard and the minimum age limit is 18 years and the maximum age limit for 
the general category is 41 years and for OBC 44 years and for SC/ST 46 years.  The

no role in the appointment of the labourers.  
 15.4. Permanency of the Casual Labourers 
 
The casual labourers are made permanent to the vacancies against the 
sanctioned post of the permanent labourers based on farm wise seniority.  The 
seniority is calculated based on the number of days worked as casual labourer and 
also by reckoning the holidays and leave for which the casual labourers are eligible 
for wages.  Daily wage service will not be counted for Seniority.  If the number of 
days worked by two or more labourers are equal, preference will be given to those 
who are senior in age. 
 
In the beginning of every calendar year, the seniority list of the casual labourers 
in all the farms has to be prepared by the respective Farm Superintendents/ Officers 
and published in the notice board of the farms and sufficient time has to be given to 
the labourers to raise objections if any.  And after rectifying the objections/ defects, 
the draft Seniority list has to be finalised and the vacancies arising in the concerned

18.2.2.3. New seed policy (1988) 
 
 
The Ministry of Agriculture, vide Letter No.11-71/88-SD-1 dated September 
16, 1988 has brought out ‘New Policy on Seed Development’, with the aim of 
providing the farmer the best planting materials available in the world so as to 
increase productivity and thereby increasing farm income and export earnings. The 
policy lays special emphasis on; 
371 
i. Import of high quality of seeds- A time bound programme to modernize plant 
quarantine facilities 
ii. Effective implementation of procedures for quarantine /post entry quarantine  
iii. Incentives to encourage the domestic industry 
iv. Import of quality seeds. 
 
 
The following are the guidelines for the import of above categories of 
seed/planting material under the Seed Policy. 
1. Import of seeds of coarse cereals/pulses/oil seeds 
 
The import of seeds of coarse cereals/pulses/oil seeds is permitted for a period 
not exceeding two years by companies that have technical/financial collaboration 
with companies abroad, provided that the latter agree to supply parental lines/nucleus 
or breeder seed technology to the Indian firm within two years of first shipment of 
commercial consignment. The bulk import is permitted by the importer based on the 
recommendation issued by the Department of Agriculture & Cooperation (DAC) after 
considering the trial/evaluation report of the varieties/hybrids, which he intends to 
import. The Plant Protection Advisor (PPA) or any other officer notified for the said 
purpose issues the import permit based on the recommendation of DAC. However the 
recommendation of DAC is not required for import of trial material. The quantities 
of the seed permitted for import for initial trials by the importer, for Indian Council 
of Agricultural Research (ICAR) multi-location trials & agronomic trials or combined 
trials, guidelines (vide Letter No. 11-71/88/S.D.I dated 30th January 1989) issued by 
the Ministry of Agriculture as per Para 4.3.5 of Seed Policy.  
 
And also, the quantities of seeds of parental lines required to be sampled and 
submitted in sealed condition for accession to gene bank of National Bureau of Plant 
Genetic Resources (NBPGR), New Delhi (vide Letter No. 11-102/88-S.D.I dated 5th 
February 1991) is as per Para 4.3.8 of Seed Policy. The imported consignment shall 
be subjected to detailed testing for a period of 30-35 days and the same purpose the 
372 
consignment will be held under detention in Airport Authority of India (AAI) 
warehouse or any customs bonded warehouse at the cost of importer. 
2. Import of vegetable & flower seeds 
    The bulk import of vegetable & flower seeds is permitted under Open General 
License (OGL) by the eligible importers viz.,  
(i) Departments of Agriculture/Horticulture of the State Governments, State 
Agricultural Universities and ICAR; 
(ii) Seed producing Indian companies/firms after registration with National Seeds 
Corporation;  
(iii) National Seeds corporation (NSC), State Seeds Corporations;  
(iv) Food processing industrial units; 
(v) Growers of vegetables and flowers registered with Director of 
Horticulture/Agriculture of the State Government. The imported seed is subject to 
detailed seed testing for a period of 30-35 days on arrival at the port of entry. 
However, permit issued by PPA or any other competent officer notified for this 
purpose, is required for import of vegetable seeds but not flower seeds. 
3. Import of bulbs &tubers of flowers 
         The bulk import of bulbs & tubers of flowers and ornamentals is allowed 
under OGL by eligible importers as stated above. The imported consignments shall 
be subjected to grow-out test for a period of 35-40 days on arrival at the port of 
entry and for the same purpose the consignment will be held under detention in 
cold storage under customs bond or the imported bulbs & tubers may be subjected 
to post-entry quarantine instead of grow-out test at the specific request of the 
importer (vide Ministry of Agriculture Letter No. 8-55/93-PP.I, dated 10th January 
1998).The bulbs/tubers are required to be sown in individual poly bags and are 
subjected to joint inspection by DIA and the officer of concerned Plant Quarantine 
373 
Stations (PQS) during Post-Entry Quarantine (PEQ) period specified at the time of 
issue of permit.

16.2.2.4. National Seed Policy, 2002 
 
The Seeds Act, 1966 and Seeds Control Order promulgated thereunder, and the 
New Policy on Seeds Development, 1988, form the basis of promotion and regulation 
of the Seed Industry. Far-reaching changes, however, have taken place in the national 
economic and agricultural scenario and in the international environment since the 
enactment of the existing seed legislation and the announcement of the 1988 Policy. 
The National seed policy is based on the recommendation of M.V. Rao 
committee in 2002. The National Seed Policy 2002 is meant to "Strengthen the seed 
374 
industry" in view of the liberalisation in the farm sector under the World Trade 
Organisation (WTO). This policy was launched to provide intellectual property 
protection to new plant varieties, usher this sector into planned development, protect 
the interest of farmers and encourage conservation of agro-biodiversity. This policy 
had 10 thrust areas as follows: 
j.     Varietal Development and Plant Varieties Protection 
ii.      Seed Production  
iii. 
Quality Assurance  
iv. 
Seed Distribution and Marketing.  
v. 
Infrastructure facilities  
vi. 
Transgenic Plant Varieties  
vii. 
Import of seeds and planting material  
viii. Export of seeds  
ix. 
Promotion of Domestic Seed  
x. 
Strengthening of monitoring system 
 
16.2.2.5. The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers’ Rights (PPV 
&FR) Act, 2001 
 
16.2.2.5.1. Introduction  
 
The Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) are generally being applicable to 
industrial property only. The patent laws of India did not provide for IPRs on living 
organisms including plant varieties. The question of plant variety protection has been 
brought in to sharp focus by Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual 
Property Rights (TRIPS) which is a part of Agreement establishing World Trade 
Organization (WTO). India is a signatory to TRIPS agreement, which casts an 
obligation on member countries to provide for a system of plant variety protection 
either through patents or through a sui generis legislation framework or a combination 
thereof. Under these agreements, a legislative framework for plant variety protection 
has to be provided by member countries within a specified time period. While this 
375 
has lent some urgency to the question of plant variety protection, the question of plant 
variety rights, even independent of the obligations posed by TRIP’s agreement, has 
been under active consideration in view of our strong agricultural research system. 
In order to provide for the establishment of an effective system for the 
protection of plant varieties, the rights of farmers and plant breeders and to encourage 
the development of new varieties of plants it has been considered necessary to 
recognize and to protect the rights of the farmers in respect their contributions made 
at any time in conserving, improving and making available plant genetic resources 
for the development of new plant varieties.  
 Accordingly, the Government of India enacted “The Protection of Plant 
Varieties and Farmers’ Rights (PPV &FR) Act, 2001” adopting sui generis system. 
Indian legislation is not only in conformity with International Union for the Protection 
of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV), 1978, but also have sufficient provisions to 
protect the interests of public sector breeding institutions and the farmers.  
The legislation recognizes the contributions of both commercial plant breeders 
and farmers in plant breeding activity and also provides to implement TRIPs in a way 
that supports the specific socio-economic interests of all the stakeholders including 
private, public sectors and research institutions, as well as resource-constrained 
farmers.   
In order to implement the provisions of the Act the Department of Agriculture 
and Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture established the Protection of Plant Varieties 
and Farmers’ Rights Authority on 11th November, 2005. The Chairperson is the 
Chief Executive of the Authority. Besides the Chairperson, the Authority has 15 
members, as notified by the Government of India (GOI).The Registrar General is the 
ex-officio Member Secretary of the Authority. 
16.2.2.5.2. Objectives of the PPV & FR Act, 2001 
1. To establish an effective system for the protection of plant varieties, the rights 
of farmers and plant breeders and to encourage the development of new 
varieties of plants. 
376 
2. To recognize and protect the rights of farmers in respect of their contributions 
made at any time in conserving, improving and making available plant 
genetic resources for the development of new plant varieties. 
3. To accelerate agricultural development in the country, protect plant breeders’ 
rights; stimulate investment for research and development both in public & 
private sector for the development new of plant varieties. 
4. Facilitate the growth of seed industry in the country which will ensure the 
availability of high quality seeds and planting material to the farmers. 
 
16.2.2.5.3. Rights under the Act 
1. Breeders’ Rights: Breeders will have exclusive rights to produce, sell, market, 
distribute, import or export the protected variety. Breeder can appoint agent/ licensee 
and may exercise for civil remedy in case of infringement of rights. 
2. Researchers’ Rights: Researcher can use any of the registered variety under the 
Act for conducting experiment or research. This includes the use of a variety as an 
initial source of variety for the purpose of developing another variety but repeated 
use needs prior permission of the registered breeder. 
3. Farmers’ Rights:  
i. A Farmer who has evolved or developed a new variety is entitled for 
registration and protection in like manner as a breeder of a variety; 
Farmers variety can also be registered as an extant variety; 
ii. A farmer can save, use, sow, re-sow, exchange, share or sell his farm 
produce including seed of a variety protected under the PPV & FR Act, 
2001 in the same manner as he was entitled before the coming into 
force of this Act provided farmer shall not be entitled to sell branded 
seed of a variety protected under the PPV&FR Act, 2001; 
iii. Farmers are eligible for recognition and rewards for the conservation 
of Plant Genetic Resources of land races and wild relatives of economic 
plants; 
377 
iv. There is also a provision for compensation to the farmers for non-
performance of variety under Section 39 (2) of the Act, 2001 and 
v. Farmer shall not be liable to pay any fee in any proceeding before the 
Authority or Registrar or the Tribunal or the High Court under the Act. 
16.2.2.5.4. Registration 
A variety is eligible for registration under the Act if it essentially fulfills the 
criteria of Distinctiveness, Uniformity and Stability (DUS). The Central 
Government issues notification in official Gazettes specifying the genera and 
species for the purpose of registration of varieties. 
So far, the Central Government has notified 57 crop species for the purpose of 
registration. The PPV & FR Authority has developed “Guidelines for the Conduct 
of Species Specific Distinctiveness, Uniformity and Stability,” tests or “Specific 
Guidelines’, for individual crop species. These include bread wheat, rice, maize, 
sorghum, pearl millet, chickpea, pigeon pea, green gram, black gram, field 
pea/garden pea, kidney bean/French bean, lentil, diploid cotton (two species), 
tetraploid cotton (two species), jute (two species), sugarcane, ginger, turmeric, 
Indian mustard, karan rai, rapeseed, gobhi sarson, sunflower, safflower, castor, 
sesame, linseed, groundnut, soybean, black pepper, small cardamom, rose, 
chrysanthemum, mango, potato, eggplant, tomato, lady’s finger, cauliflower, 
cabbage, onion, garlic, durum, dicoccum and triticum species of wheat, jsabgol, 
menthol mint, damask rose, periwinkle brahmi, orchids (Venda, cymbidium & 
Dendrobium) 
Fees for registration 
The application for registration of plant varieties should be accompanied with 
the fee of registration prescribed by the authority. The Registration of a variety is 
renewable subject to payment of annual fee as notified in the Plant Variety Journal 
of India of the Authority. 
 
 
378 
 
16.2.2.5.5. Certificate of Registration 
Applications which have fulfilled all requirements and have been finally 
accepted by the Registrar for registration were issued Certificates of Registration. 
The certificate of registration issued will be valid for nine years in case of trees and 
vines and six years in case of other crops. It may be reviewed and renewed for the 
remaining period on payment of renewal fees subject to the condition that total 
period on payment of renewal fees and that total period of validity shall not exceed 
eighteen years in case of trees and vines from the date registration of the variety, 
fifteen years from the date of notification of variety under the Seeds Act, 1996 and 
in other cases fifteen years from the date registration of the variety.  
16.2.2.5.6. National Register of Plant Varieties 
National Register of Plant Varieties has been kept at the head office of the 
Registry, containing the names of all the registered plant varieties with the names and 
addresses of their respective breeders, the rights of such breeders in respect of the 
registered varieties, the particulars of the denomination of each registered variety, its 
seed or other propagating material along with specification of salient features thereof 
and such other matters as may be prescribed. 
16.2.2.5.7. Plant Varieties Protection Appellate Tribunal 
The Act provides for establishment of Plant Varieties Protection Appellate 
Tribunal (PVPAT). All orders or decisions of the Registrar of Authority relating to 
registration of variety and orders or decisions of the Registrar relating to registration 
as agent or licensee can be appealed in the Tribunal. Further, all orders or decisions 
of Authority relating to benefit sharing, revocation of compulsory license and 
payment of compensation can also be appealed in the Tribunal. There is transitory 
provision by which it is provided that till the PVPAT is established the Intellectual 
Property Appellate Board (IPAB) will exercise the jurisdiction of PVPAT.  The 
decisions of the PVPAT can be challenged in high Court. The Tribunal shall dispose 
of the appeal within one year.
