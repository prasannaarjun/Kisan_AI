PREFACE 
 
In Kerala, the process of a Five-Year Plan is an exercise in people’s participation. At the end of 
September 2016, the Kerala State Planning Board began an effort to conduct the widest possible 
consultations before formulating the Plan. The Planning Board formed 43 Working Groups, with a total 
of more than 700 members – scholars, administrators, social and political activists and other experts. 
Although the Reports do not represent the official position of the Government of Kerala, their content 
will help in the formulation of the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan document. 
 
This document is the report of the Working Group on Agricultural in Agriculture. The Chairpersons of 
the Working Group were Dr Raju Narayanaswamy IAS and Professor Venkatesh Athreya. The Member 
of the Planning Board who coordinated the activities of the Working Group was Professor R 
Ramakumar. The concerned Chief of Division was Dr P Rajasekharan.

CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION 
 
1. 
The global economy is yet to see a revival as indicated by the downward revision of world gross 
product to 2.4 per cent in 2015 from the 2.8 per cent forecast in mid-2015. Similarly, the growth 
performance of agriculture sector in India also suffered a setback in the recent years and the 
slowdown had several structural consequences including agrarian distress. The sector grew only by 
1.6 percent per annum in the first four years of the ongoing Five-Year Plan as against the targeted 4 
per cent annual growth. Although the liberalization regime ensured around 7 per cent growth rate in 
the overall GDP, it has miserably failed in the agriculture sector with the deceleration of growth rate. 
Hence, it is evident that the economic growth experienced has not translated into real per capita 
income growth for the bulk of the workforce employed in agriculture.  
 
Growth in Agriculture 
 
2. 
In order to develop a perspective approach for agricultural development in the 13th plan, an analysis 
of the performance of the sector in the immediately preceding plan periods is attempted in the 
following pages: 
 
3. 
There has been a gradual decline in the area, production and productivity of a majority of crops 
during the previous plan periods commencing from the 10th plan as illustrated in Fig.1-3.

The Five-Year Plans implemented in the state had given considerable importance to the subsector 
Agriculture for accelerating growth of the economy.  Under Agriculture &Allied sectors, the 
subsector Agriculture including Crop Husbandry, Marketing, Storage & Ware housing and Other 
Agriculture programmes accounts the largest share over the plan periods. During 12th plan in order 
to revive the agrarian economy of the Wayanad district a package of schemes were initiated under 
Wayanad package and included in the sector Special Programme for Area Development. The share

of expenditure for Agriculture under Agriculture & allied sectors was around 43 % in the 10th plan, 
subsequently increased to 46.7% in the 11th plan and 48.7% in the 12th plan. The share of 
expenditure for Agriculture to total plan expenditure is 2.4% in the 10th plan and it was increased to 
2.9% in 11th plan and 3.5% during 12th plan.  The details are given in Table 1.

Apart from state plan support considerable support was given through the plans of Local Self 
Governments for the development of Agriculture from Ninth plan onwards. The approach and 
strategies of the previous plans focused on area expansion under paddy, coconut, cashew, fruits, 
vegetables and spices, augmenting productivity of these crops and diversification of product base for 
maximizing income from unit area.

CHAPTER 2 
ELEVENTH FIVE YEAR PLAN – REVIEW 
 
6. 
During XI Five-Year Plan, an amount of Rs 1337.09 crore was set apart for the development of 
Crop Husbandry (including Marketing, Storage and Ware housing) under state plan with 276% 
increase over the Xth plan outlay of Rs 355.47 crore. The total expenditure during XI plan was Rs 
1260.23 crore (94 % of budgeted outlay) with 152 % increase over the Xth plan expenditure of Rs 
499.86 crore. Apart from this an amount of Rs 121.95 crore was spent through Centrally Sponsored 
Schemes during XIth plan (Table.2).

CHAPTER 3 
12TH FIVE YEAR PLAN 
 
10. The approach to agriculture in the 12th Plan focused on raising income of farmers through 
increasing productivity, subsidiary occupations, better marketing and through promotion of value 
added products. Emphasis given for strengthening extension activities through ATMA and 
Krishibhavans by promoting the concept of lead farmer and satellite farmers and by using new tools 
of Information technology and new technologies like biotechnology and precision farming 
promoted and encouraged through extension. Special focus for food security initiated targeting to 
increase rice production by 25 percent and vegetable production by 50 percent from the base level 
.Risk Management strategies were worked out and projects to address weather and price induced risk 
were identified. In order to provide service to farmers Agro service centers were setup with the 
support of LSG Institutions and Co-operatives. Value addition projects were given special focus and 
cash crops and food crops processing encouraged. Use of micro nutrients based on soil studies and 
comprehensive soil health management were taken up for agricultural productivity. Strengthened 
market infrastructure by constructing go downs and cold storages.

Key Initiatives and Achievements in 12th Plan Period in Agriculture 
 
13. The key initiatives and salient achievements during 12th plan were as following: 
1. 
In order to strengthen ATMA model of extension supported by Government of India, new 
ATMA plus was introduced from 2013-14. 
2. 
A major project on vegetable development was initiated during 2012-13to achieve self-
sufficiency in vegetable production. During 2012-13 to 2015-16, Rs250.75 crore was budgeted 
for Vegetable development and the expenditure incurred is Rs233.97 crore (93%).  Vegetable 
production has increased by 64 percent from 8.25 lakh tonnes in 2011-12 to 13.55lakh tones 
in 2014-15. 
3. 
Agro service centres (ASC) established at block level to facilitate integration of services like 
mechanisation, labor support, biopharmacy and planting materials, soil testing support and 
other technology based services. The Farmers Service Centers proposed at the block level 
under the Cooperation Department was linked with the agro-service centres for input 
delivery. During 2012-13 to 2015-16, 50 Agro service centres through Agriculture department 
and 60 Farmer Service Centres through cooperation department were established for 
improved service delivery to farmers.  
4. 
Karshikakarmasena established in 200 selected panchayats under the supervision of 
Krishibhavans. The farmers enrolled were given training for various agriculture skills and 
mechanisation. 
5. 
The multi institutional project on soil health management initiated during the period 2010 was 
completed and analysed about 2 lakh soil samples and deficient areas in boron, magnesium etc 
were identified. The major development project on support to soil ameliorants and 
micronutrients were initiated. Soil test based Health cards were issued to 1.41 lakh farmers. 
900 Nutrient Management Plans (NMP) were prepared for various panchayats/ 
municipalities/ corporations and distributed to krishibhavans. Also 60 Block level Nutrient 
Management Plans and the District level Nutrient Management Plans of Wayanad, Kozhikode 
and Kasaragod districts were released. 
6. 
A new approach on crop health management was initiated during 2013-14 to bring together 
management of sustainable ecosystems and people’s health through good plant protection 
practices (GPPP). A PG Diploma programme on plant health management has been initiated 
for the technical officers of the Department of Agriculture in collaboration with the National 
Institute of Plant Health Management, Hyderabad. Under the scheme Crop Health 
Management, Plant Health Clinics were established in 118 blocks and referral clinics in 4 
districts.  
7. 
An Electronic fund transfer methodology for payments to the beneficiaries of different 
schemes of the Agriculture Department from 2012-13 onwards was initiated. As on March, 
2014, registration 18.77lakh farmers were completed, and the subsidy amount distributed 
through banks in 152 blocks, for all beneficiaries. Subsidies worth Rs 912.33crore have been 
successfully transferred to thousands of farmers during 2012-13 to2014-15. 
8 
8. 
Hi-Tech Agriculture has been given priority in the State during the 12th Plan period and 
initiated in 2012-13 as part of Vegetable Development programme. A total number of 1200 
poly houses was established during 12th plan.   
9. 
Agriculture Development Policy formulated in the state by a committee consisting of experts 
in Agriculture, peoples/farmers representatives, and after detailed discussion the policy has 
been approved by the Govt.  
10. Coconut development project was restructured and expanded with Kerasamrudhi component 
to supply dwarf seedlings, Keragramam project for focused coconut development, and 
production of Neera and procurement of coconut through KrishiBhavan. Procured 70214 
Metric Tonnes of copra through Kerafed. 
11. SFAC was strengthened for supporting value addition and provided assistance to coconut 
based and fruit and vegetable based units. 
 
Critical Gaps during 12thPlan 
 
14. Critical gaps identified during 12th plan were as follows, 
1. 
Inadequate focus on rice development 
2. 
Lack of focused implementation of extension scheme 
3. 
Risk management including human-animal conflict 
4. 
Poor intervention in fruits, flowers, urban agriculture medicinal plants 
5. 
Marketing and value addition 
 
The Setting 
 
15. The foregoing analysis helps in deriving the broad profile features of Kerala agriculture in the 
current context:  The State has witnessed a remarkable transformation in agricultural sector since its 
formation in 1956. The agro-climatic conditions in the State suit the cultivation of a variety of 
seasonal crops and perennial crops. Coconut farming constituting almost 39.4 percent of the state’s 
net cropped area is facing severe setback in recent years owing to fall in market price and low 
productivity due to pest and disease attacks. Kerala’s share in area of coconut farming in the country 
had declined from 69% in 1955-56 to 32.89% in 2014-15. The State had achieved 50 percent self -
sufficiency in rice production in 1972-73. But the area and production of paddy have declined at an 
alarming rate in the later years. The high remittance from abroad boosted the real estate and 
construction sectors in Kerala weaning away the land under paddy and other crops and labor force 
involved in cultivation and small land owners to real estate sector. Although Kerala has wide 
network of rivers, out of the net cropped area of the state, only 19 percent is irrigated. The net area 
irrigated has slightly increased from 3.93 lakh hectares during 2004-05 to 4.14lakh hectares during 
2014-15. Coconut is the major irrigated crop of the state which accounts for 35 per cent of the gross 
irrigated area followed by paddy with 33 per cent. Kerala, a state which conceived and implemented 
the progressive Land Reforms Act with the aim of maintaining sustainability of productive land, is 
now facing the adverse effects of undesirable changes in many facets including in the land use. 
Cropping intensity decreased by 11per cent and net area sown by five per cent during the same 
period. Despite the strong demand for food crops, a steady increase in land put on non-agricultural 
use, cultivable waste and current fallow is also observed. The State is gradually turning into a non-
agrarian one with less than 30 per cent and 10 per cent contributions to employment and economy, 
respectively. The moot question is that can Kerala afford to continue to be so in the long-term 
interests of the State and its people? 
 
9 
The Emerging Issues 
 
16. The emerging issues of Kerala’s agriculture sector is listed below, 
1. 
The growth performance of the agriculture and allied sectors in Kerala has been fluctuating 
across the plan periods. It witnessed a positive growth of 1.8% in 10th plan period but a 
negative growth rate of -1.3% in the 11th Five Year Plan. In 2015-16, the performance of the 
sector has been bleak, it clocking a negative growth rate of -11% in crop production. The 
share of public investment in agriculture is also steadily declining.  
2. 
In a liberalized trade regime involving multi-national and bi-lateral trade agreements, to make 
agriculture a profitable business activity, productivity enhancement and cost reduction are 
inevitable. Currently the productivity of crops cultivated in the State remains stagnant and in 
most cases are palpably below international and national averages reducing the 
competitiveness of our farmers in the global and domestic markets.  
3. 
With the changing profile of people in Kerala characterized by the predominance of part-time 
farming, absentee-landlordism, urban migration etc. imaginative strategies and programmes to 
attract people including youth to agriculture are wanting at present.  
4. 
A look at the area and production of crops reveals a worrisome trend, and it is alarming in the 
case of food crops such as paddy, and cassava and other important crops including coconut. 
The total area under food crops in the 1970’s was around 20 lakh ha. Presently, it is in the 
around 13 lakh ha. Besides rice, the other crops such as coconut, pepper, cashew and tubers 
have also recorded sharp decline in area and production in the recent years, particularly after 
launching of the liberalization policies. Perhaps, banana and vegetable crops alone have 
registered a positive growth in cultivated area and production in the recent times, besides 
rubber. 
5. 
Besides many other reasons, soil related constraints viz. high acidity, deficiency of macro, 
secondary and micro -nutrients adversely affect crop health and productivity.  
6. 
Climate related factors such as erratic monsoon, increasing temperatures, floods, drought, 
salinity etc. play havoc with the livelihoods of farmers. Climate smart agriculture is not now 
being given due consideration reducing the levels of resilience of the farming community.  
7. 
Unavailability of skilled labor, high labor cost and low mechanization continue to be serious 
hurdles to agriculture development.  
8. 
Availability of quality seeds and planting materials, other agricultural inputs especially bio-
inputs, infrastructure facilities for storage and primary processing and service delivery are not 
matching with the requirement.   
9. 
The performance of the plantation sector in the state is disheartening and the market 
instability is unparalleled in the history affecting the livelihood security of the farmers and the 
plantation laborers numbering 14 lakhs.  
10. The decline in area of food crops is normally compensated by a corresponding expansion in 
the area of other plantation crops in Kerala. Of late, tendencies like large scale fallowing of 
land, conversion of farm lands for other purposes nominal or non-intensive cultivation, 
leasing etc, are increasingly gaining ground. Large scale conversion and filling up of wetland, 
mainly paddy land, is leading to an ecosystem crisis. The decline in agriculture tends to knock 
down allied activities such as animal husbandry, poultry, traditional village industries and the 
rural economy in general. Seventy eight percent of agricultural households in Kerala were 
indebted with the average amount at Rs 213,600 while the national averages were only 52% 
and Rs 47,000, respectively. 
11. The average size of an operational holding in the state is 0.21 ha. Marginal farmers accounted 
for 96.3% of the total number of land holdings. The area covered by these holdings is 58.6% 
of the aggregate area of operational holdings. The average holding size of the marginal 
10 
farmers group is only 0.13 ha, probably one of the lowest in the world. Farmers’ 
organizations, bolstering social capital development among these marginalized sections, have 
not evolved substantially in the State.  
12. Enterprise diversification, agro-processing and value addition in agriculture which are essential 
for enhancing the revenue from the farming are at a very low level in the State.   
13. The support for the LSG’s from the state and national Governments was also seen lagging 
with respect to the primary production in different time periods without any continuous and 
firm commitment from these higher levels of Governments which requires immediate 
rectification. The integration of transferred departments with the LSGs at various levels has to 
be reinforced to augment the impact of the process of democratic decentralization in the 
State. 
14. The role of the co-operative sector in agricultural development has not been realized to the 
full potential although some success models have emerged here and there. 
15. Collective farming is an important area of Kudumbashree which aims at food security both at 
household and community level. In this regard, more hand holding support including 
facilitation with banks and technology support are essential for improving livelihood of the 
women groups involved in farming. 
16. Fallow land utilization for agricultural production is perceptibly low for a small state like 
Kerala. Current fallows, fallows other than current fallows and cultivable waste lands are 
increasing at an alarming rate accounting for around two lakh hectares. In a land-constrained 
state like Kerala, this luxury is socially unaffordable. 
17. Of late, organic farming and high-tech agricultural practices are gaining momentum in the 
state and many state interventions are being implemented to promote the same. More often 
quality and transparency have become the casualties in both of these arenas. Fake labeling of 
organic products and organic inputs, alleged corruption resulting in sub- standard structures 
for high-tech agriculture also mar the potential of these emerging arenas of agricultural 
development. 
18. Demand driven and location-specific projects for agricultural development are a rarity and 
ritualistic and non – focused projects leading to thin spread of resources and lack of time-
bound and visible impact. 
19. Governance issues including lapses in hand-holding, co-ordinating and monitoring of the 
progress of projects have led to the poor performance of even well-conceived projects. 
20.  Over-emphasis on financial targets and absence of social audit of agricultural development 
projects have resulted in poor impact. 
21. The extension personnel at grass root level are overburdened with routine office work and are 
unable to deliver the technical and support services to the farmers in time effectively. Use of 
ICT / social media / hybrid media for enhancing the efficiency of delivery of extension and 
advisory services is also in a primordial stage in the State.  
22. Most of the phenomenal advances in agricultural development had the backing of 
breakthrough technologies which are lacking in Kerala agriculture at present despite the 
presence of a vast network of Research and Development institutions in the State. Besides, 
the functional linkages with national institutes for utilizing available technologies in Kerala 
agriculture are also wanting.  
 
The Way Forward 
 
17. It is heartening to note that, of late, there is an emerging appreciation for farmers and farming in the 
mindset of Kerala community-thanks to the efforts of the governments, political parties, social 
activists, media and other sections of the society. The development programs like the vegetable 
11 
development program specially focusing on educational institutions, the soil and crop health 
management program, the agro-ecological zonation program, the ATMAPLUS AND LEADS 
Project, the electronic payment system etc. implemented in the past have made a mark in Kerala 
agriculture and hence they have to be further strengthened and scaled up to give effect to the 
concept of ‘continuity with change’ in the 13th Plan. Agriculture needs to be made a part of school 
curriculum to sensitise the young generation about dignity of farming and sustainable use of 
resources for ensuring food safety and food independence so essential for achieving the ideal of ‘one 
health’. Farm families’ livelihood security has to be ensured by making farming remunerative thereby 
attracting the women and younger generation also to agriculture and agribusiness. Through crop 
intensification, the cropping intensity in the state has to be enhanced from a meager 128 per cent 
now to at least 150 per cent during the 13th plan period. Intensified Integrated Farming System 
(IIFS) approach is inevitable in this context. Special focus projects for rice, coconut, pepper, ethnic 
fruits and vegetables, floriculture, medicinal plants, apiculture, value addition, social capital 
development etc. have also to be formulated.

CHAPTER 4 
13TH FIVE YEAR PLAN- APPROACHES, STRATEGIES AND SUGGESTIONS 
 
Motto for Agriculture Development in the 13thPlan 
 
18. The twin objectives of ensuring sustainable use of natural resources and sustainable livelihoods for 
the people engaged in agriculture are reflected in the following motto for Agriculture Development 
in the 13th Five Year Plan: 
 
Responsible Agriculture – Responsive Agriculture 
 
19. The thrust will be shifted from crops and cropping systems to sustainable integrated farming systems 
and farmers’ welfare. Efforts will have to be made to use the natural resources sustainably and at the 
same time augmenting farm families’ income through scientific technological applications including 
intensification, value addition and diversification. To realize the above, a comprehensive 
restructuring of the agriculture sector including the R&D, Extension and Co-operative Institutions 
and other groups is warranted. The focus will be on the promotion of ‘Intensified Integrated 
Farming Systems (IIFS)’ for ensuring maximum food sovereignty and food safety through group-
centric innovations, institutions and initiatives and constant campaigning for capacity development 
of all the stakeholder groups including researchers, extension personnel, farmers, farm women, 
youth, students and agricultural labourers. 
 
20. To rejuvenate the agricultural sector and to achieve convergence with the flagship programs of the 
GOK envisaged under the ‘HarithaKeralam Mission’(HKM), institutional restructuring in the 
agriculture and allied departments/agencies is desirable at the levels of compact area groups of 
farmers and cluster of groups within a ward, cluster of wards,  LSG, Block, agro-ecological units, 
District and State, under the pioneering program of ‘Sustainable Intensification Promotion Through 
Area Group Approach (SIPTAGA)’. Appropriate convergence platforms for HKM at all levels of 
implementation will have to be created. The technical line Departments of Agriculture, Animal 
Husbandry, Dairy Development, Fisheries, Irrigation etc. will have to work in tandem with the 
HKM led by the representatives of the LSGs. This will help in the sustainable and integrated use of 
natural resources including land, water and enriching soil, root, plant, animal and human health by 
recycling of agricultural and house- hold waste for enhancing productivity, production, income and 
profit for the farming community. Specific thrust areas to realize these objectives have to be 
identified, development programmes designed, implemented, monitored and assessed for impact 
assiduously in a participatory manner. 
 
Land Use 
 
21. Land use planning presents a development approach that contributes to the prevention of land use 
conflicts, the adaptation of land uses to physical and ecological conditions, the lasting protection of 
land as a natural resource, lasting productive use of land and a balance use that fulfills all social, 
ecological and economic requirements. Land evaluation which is a necessity for successful land use 
planning must consider land capability, land sustainability and production potential. Suggested land 
use need to be economically viable, technically sound, politically acceptable, maximum benefits, 
environmentally sound, results must be sustainable and socially acceptable to the people.    
 
22. Since urban spread in Kerala is very active, it needs a dynamic land use planning.  Land use planning 
should be with people’s participation, should preserve critical habitats, conserve biodiversity, and 
13 
avoid land uses that deplete natural resources.  It should promote sustainable resource utilization by 
regulating degrading activities.   
 
23. Panchayats, the basic unit of planning, preparing spatial database on land and water at micro level on 
a regular basis, assumes greater significance. Resource based land use planning document should be 
prepared in consortium mode based on a multi- disciplinary approach and it should be economically 
viable, environmentally sound and implemented on a sustainable basis.  Effective land use planning 
could be made only by establishing synergy with departments, universities, farmer’s forum, NARP 
centres, R&D extension agencies, etc.  Proper Advisory Support Service should be evolved to advice 
the Local Self Governments on scientific use of soil and land resource data for local application and 
local development. 
 
24. Decision Support Systems that analyze future land use options for food security, sustainable Natural 
Resources Management & safe environment, based on present technical knowledge, socio economic 
constraints & anticipated future objective constraint the need of the hour. This accompanied by a 
strong planning process, where communities and various stakeholders are involved, can strengthen 
the decision making process on allocation and utilization of land resources. 
 
25. Food security is a serious issue among the landless, marginal and small land holders of Kerala. A 
portion of population in our State is not having access to food because of rural poverty. The fertility 
status of Kerala soil is degrading and the food produced in such soils is deficient in nutrients. 
Government should bestow more attention on developing the homestead farming systems in the 
State.  Major ecosystem services provided by home gardens are biodiversity conservation, soil and 
water conservation, nutrient recycling, energy savings and carbons sequestration. Home gardens 
should be considered as a basic unit of watershed development & suitable models for each agro 
ecological unit are to be developed, since land use and farmer preferences are different in each unit.  
 
26. Information technology can contribute immensely for successful land use planning.  High resolution 
satellite imageries & GPS could be effectively utilized for assessing and monitoring the activities.  
Reliable support information including the change in climate, market fluctuations, export, storage, 
post- harvest, etc. to be provided to farmers through KIOSKS set up with adequate infrastructure 
and connectivity. This is very important in Kerala where land holdings are small and marginal. 
 
27. It is important to identify the suitable ecological niche for food crops, cash crops, other natural 
resources etc. in the available land area for the effective land use in Kerala. Suitable intercrops may 
be introduced in Rubber, Coconut, Cocoa, Arecanut etc., by adjusting the planting geometry for 
improving the cropping intensity. The current scenario of less attractive prices for rubber and the 
consequent decrease in replanted area under rubber provides an opportunity for bringing more area 
under food crops.   
 
28. Kerala, being consumer state, all efforts need to directed towards protection of land under 
agriculture to cater to the needs of the farmers and address food security. The barren uncultivable 
lands may be looked for industrialization and infrastructure building and the water bodies, paddy 
fields and productive agricultural land should be protected to ensure a sustainable agricultural 
production and land use. Farmers should be given support/royalty for cultivating food crops which 
are economically not viable. 
 
29. Kerala is a State with rich land resource but without Land Use Policy or statute to regulate its use. It 
will lead the State into a disastrous situation in land planning. A specific enactment regulating the 
14 
non-protected lands is the need of the hour. Land use planning should ensure productive capacity, 
proper irrigation and fertility of the arable lands and optimum agriculture production. The 
indiscriminate conversion of land has to be curbed.  
 
30. Good understanding of the resource base of the State is vital for evolving appropriate technologies 
for natural resource conservation.  River basin plan with micro watersheds as basic units of planning 
for water resource conservation and groundwater recharge is necessary to address the issue of water 
scarcity especially in the context of climate change.   
 
31. Emphasizing the need for a land use planning, land use pattern in Kerala should be re-assessed and 
revised to the extent possible to conserve our precious agricultural lands, water bodies, wetlands and 
biological hotspots. 
 
Major Crops 
 
Food Crops and Spices 
 
32. Agriculture development experience of Kerala since the last few decades has been characterised by 
sharp decline in the area under food crops and the substantial expansion in the area under non-food 
crops. Paddy cultivation in Kerala has witnessed a steady decline since the 1980s. The state needs 
about 40 lakh tonnes of rice per annum to feed her people. However, it hardly produces 5.62 lakh 
tonnes. The non-remunerative nature of paddy cultivation as compared to other crops in the State 
has been a major deterrent in this respect. The sharp fall in the area under paddy cultivation as well 
as in the quantity of rice produced in the State has had important implications for Kerala's economic, 
ecological and social development. Tapioca is another important food crop of Kerala which was 
popularized as a cereal substitute towards the end of 19th century itself in the State. The role of 
tapioca in the food security of the state is even more prominent today with ever declining area and 
production under rice. However, the area under tapioca also started declining from 1990-91 onwards 
and dropped down to 3.39 per cent of the net sown area by 2014-15. The annual consumption of 
vegetables in the state is 20.78 lakh tonnes, but the state has been producing much less than the 
requirement resulting in heavy dependence on neighbouring states. However, the area under 
vegetable cultivation has increased from 42477 ha in 2011-12 to 90533 ha in 2014-15, thanks to the 
Vegetable Development Program implemented during this period. 
 
33. The major challenges/issues confronted. In the case of paddy the major problems are 1) Non availability of 
good quality certified paddy seed 2) lack of skilled labourers 3) issues of adopting mechanization  4) 
Inadequate infrastructural facilities 5) irrigation and drainage constraints. The vegetable sector chiefly 
faces the inherent perishability, fluctuating market prices, lack of scale economies/marketing 
impediments, and frequent out breaks of pests/diseases. Price fluctuations and subsequent distress 
sale as well as the scarcity of high quality planting materials are the major issues faced by tuber crops 
sector. In the case of spices food safety regulations in the export markets and fierce competition in 
the international trade due to the regional trade agreements are the major worries. 
 
Approaches 
 
34. Paddy. The GOK have issued a hundred- point action plan guidelines as part of the celebration of 
2016 as the Rice Year which require to be implemented without delay. Area under paddy cultivation 
has to be enhanced to 3 lakh ha. During 13th Plan. Productivity has to be enhanced by at least 50 
15 
per cent. State support for this endeavor must be substantially enhanced. Following are the 
approaches that should be adopted for improvement of paddy cultivation, 
1. Certified seeds should be made available in time through NSC, KSSDA, and KSSC. Registered 
Seed production should be enhanced in department farms and through farmers under RSGP. 
Seed villages have to be developed at GramaPanchayath level to promote paddy seed production 
in selected padasekharams. Use of certified seed has to be made mandatory among farmers by 
providing it free of cost. 
2. Popularisation of Community nursery concept is needed to encourage group activity and cut 
costs. Subsidy provisions should be proportionate to actual cost of cultivation, and in this 
respect, cost of cultivation should be monitored and documented at District level by PAO on an 
annual basis. 
3. Potential of Karmasena and kudumbasree to be tapped to address the labor scarcity. Locally 
suited machineries have to be found out using services of District Agri-engineering wing.  
4. Subsidy provision should be finalized based on actual cost of cultivation incurred. Cess for Rice 
could also be levied for compensating expenses incurred by farmer.  
5. Agro Service Centres (ASC) have to be established in each block and have to be equipped with 
spare parts as well. Servicing and maintenance of farm machineries have to be made at block 
level. The responsibility of monitoring operations of ASC should be given to the Agri. 
Engineering wing. 
6. A comprehensive survey has to be conducted to identify irrigation/drainage constraints and area 
that can be brought back to cultivation on solving it. The projects have to be prioritised at 
panchayath level /block level for preparing suitable projects. Irrigation and production plans 
have to be co-ordinated to work in tandem. Support from Minor Irrigation division has to be 
ensured at required places for irrigation and drainage. RIDF funds have to be mobilised for 
project implementation.  
7. Registered Padasekharasamithies have to be directed to co-operate with KrishiBhavans to identify 
correct area cultivated by farmers, conversion of fallow lands to paddy and providing leadership 
in each productive operation.  
8. Geo-tagging the existing paddy and wetlands, utilising GIS services for monitoring conversion, 
community /group surveillance of paddy land conversion, stringent  legal action against 
violators etc are to be taken. 
9. Mini Rural godowns have to be setup in major production centres especially Kuttanad areas for 
storing paddy. 
10. Check dams, conservation of existing water resources & ponds, stream bank stabilisation 
projects have to be implemented. Funds from PMKSY, RIDF, and NABARD have to be 
mobilised. 
11. Pre- season and on season trainings shall be provided to farmers for resorting scientific soil and 
nutrient management practices, pest and disease management etc.  
12. Paddy farmers have to be arranged easy credit avenues through Kissan Credit cards. Providing 
Interest free loans through co-operatives can also be planned and implemented.  Linkage with 
procurement scheme would ensure repayment of loans. 
13. Procurement price has to be regulated in such a way that increases in price of paddy does not 
lead to more than proportionate rise in price of Rice. Managing procurement price at level of 
MSP, then payment of balance amount as incentive to farmers etc can be followed.  
14. Paddy farm schools have to be implemented in every school which has at least 10 cents to 
cultivate on the lines of school vegetable garden scheme.  
 
35. Vegetables. Capitalising on the conducive mindset of the Kerala community towards poison-free 
vegetables, at least 50,000 ha. area may be additionally brought under organic vegetable cultivation 
16 
during the 13th Plan. Following points were identified as vital for improvement in vegetable sector 
in Kerala,  
1. 
Seeds have to be provided at GramaPanchayath level through KrishiBhavans/input centres by 
sourcing from VFPCK, department farms, KAU etc.  Availability and quality has to be 
ensured throughout the year. 
2. 
Soil analysis has to be done annually to regulate use of manures and fertilizers. Soil analysis 
has to be made mandatory for issuing assistance.  
3. 
Availability of quality inputs at the correct time has to be ensured through Bio input centres at 
GramaPanchayath level. This can be done through farmer groups.  
4. 
Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) has to be promoted in vegetable production as a means 
towards safe to eat vegetables and eventually should lead to organic produce through PGS 
and NPOP certification.  
5. 
Effective utilisation using micro irrigation has to be popularised. (Drip, wick irrigation, micro 
sprinklers etc). Water harvesting structures need to be developed with the co-operation of 
farmers and public.  
6. 
Precision farming technologies suited to our conditions have to be given more focus. Rain 
shelters and open precision farming can be encouraged. A Knowledge sharing social media 
Platform has to be created so that experiences of successful farmers, experts and other 
stakeholders are shared to all.  
7. 
Production has to be stepped up to a larger scale to reduce fixed costs and for ensuring 
continuous supply. Also assistance has to be provided to famers/groups regardless of any area 
ceiling. 
8. 
Farmer Retail Outlets have to be created in all potential GramaPanchayaths by organising 
vegetable clusters and registered groups. Pricing of produce have to be monitored by 
Agricultural Officers on a weekly basis at these farmer outlets. Service charges can be 
collected from farmers as a percentage of sale price (eg.10-15%), for managing recurring 
expenses in the market like salary of staff, stationeries, power charges etc. Block level auction 
market operating on weekly basis could also be set up under the leadership of ADA’s co-
ordinating various farmer groups for managing bulk production in potential blocks.   
9. 
Marketing of safe to eat vegetables under common brand name and logo throughout the state 
would help in fetching good price and ensure faith in quality of the produce.  
10. Cold storage facilities should be extended to FRO’s at panchayath level through VDP /SHM. 
Trainings have to be given on Grading and packing of produce and it has to be focused in 
urban centres for getting premium price. KAU/KVK‘s can offer support with respect to the 
value addition. Ketchup, sauce, juice, jams, pickles, papads etc can be made.  Scope for 
exporting also has to be considered after grading /packaging.  
11. Production and marketing plan has to be made at each panchayath for managing demand and 
supply. Agricultural officer at panchayath level and DD at district level and vegetable cell at 
state level should co-ordinate efforts. IT applications/tools have to be developed for effective 
management. 
12. The targets under current schemes for expanding area under Paddy and Vegetables should be 
increased to cover additional area as targeted within a span of 5 years. New schemes for area 
expansion of tubers, spices and medicinal plants have to be put in place. The schemes would 
be implemented by the Agricultural Officers at Panchayath level based on the working 
instructions issued. Janakeeyasoothranam scheme can alsobe utilised for implementation.  The 
progress of the scheme implemented at the panchayath level will be monitored by the 
concerned Assistant Director of Agriculture. Besides this the working group constituted at 
gramapanchayath in charge of monitoring schemes implemented in Agriculture and allied 
17 
sectors would undertake concurrent evaluation of the scheme. The evaluation of the scheme 
would be done at the district level by the concerned Deputy Directors.  
13. Vegetable producer companies may be established at the major vegetable producing areas for 
the marketing of the vegetables produced by farmers. These companies can manage 
procuring, processing and marketing of fruits and vegetables in their area to realise the better 
price for crop produce. Over a period of 5 years each of the 152 Blocks in the state will have 
one vegetable producer company to be registered with Agriculture Development & Farmers’ 
Welfare Department/Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium with registered farmers as 
members. 
 
36. Tuber crops. Some of the thrust points for development of tuber crops is as follows,  
1. Good quality planting materials have to be arranged in association with department farms, 
VFPCK under the leadership of CTCRI. 
2. Information on new varieties, scientific cultivation, pest and disease management etc has to be 
given to farmers. Trainings, farm schools, demonstrations etc should be provided at field level. 
Surveillance machinery has to be put in place for pests and diseases using key farmers.  
3. To combat price fluctuations value addition is the major remedy. Tapioca can be boiled and 
dried in the conventional manner, or can be made to chips, wafers, powders, starch, papads etc 
to fetch good price. Producer groups have a role to play on this front. Credit facilities have to be 
provided to groups for such value added ventures.  
4. A model scheme to expand area under tuber crops covering minor tubers also needs to be taken 
up by the department. Since there are no schemes for tuber crops for the department, scheme 
based support would give the necessary impetus for commercial cultivation. Individuals and 
groups could be given assistance under the scheme. The workforce of MGNREGS can be 
effectively utilised for undertaking tuber crops in fallow lands.  
 
37. Spices. Promotion of “clean spices” remains the only option to fetch superior price in national and 
international markets. Following interventions and facilitations were indentified for betterment of 
spices production in the state,  
1. 
Government with the help of Spices Board needs to intervene by providing facilities for 
scientific processing centres and warehouses in major areas like Idukki and Wayanad. There is 
a need for a Quality Assurance system/ Cell at the State level for ascertaining and assuring 
quality of spices produced.  
2. 
We need to develop the processing sector in spices - Oils and oleoresins which are in great 
demand –for exploring national and international markets. Branding and securing 
geographical indications in spice trade especially pepper and cardamom remains an option. 
Contract farming in association with flavouring, cosmetics, Food processing industries under 
the leadership of spices board, Assocham, CII etc. could bring benefits to farmers. Union 
Ministry of commerce should operate a Price Control Cell to monitor the price of spices in 
international market and convey it to exporters. 
3. 
We need to train farmers and exporters on the new international food safety regime and 
quality management system in the international market. The HACCP practices should be 
enforced in the spices value chain. 
4. 
A special team to conduct a methodological study on the cultivation and trade of major spice 
crops in Kerala seems imminent focussing on the new SPS regime imposed by the WTO. The 
team should have members from IISR, Spices board, KAU, Agricultural department other 
than representatives of major stakeholders involved in spice cultivation.  
5. 
Insurance should be made mandatory for all farmers to reduce the risks of natural calamities 
.It should also cover crop loss due to pest and disease incidence.  
18 
6. 
An international Spice fest has to be hosted in Kerala preferably at Idukki to portray the 
medicinal and industrial value of indigenous Spice crops to other countries, to promote the 
scenic beauty of our rich spice growing areas, to open new marketing channels, to promote 
new business models based on spices and above all to promote spice tourism in Kerala. 
 
Coconut and Plantation Crops 
 
38. Coconut and plantation crops occupy 80 per cent of the net area cultivated and play a significant role 
in the agrarian economy of Kerala state. The major plantation crops include coconut, rubber, 
arecanut, coffee, cashew, tea and cocoa. Plantation crops have been continuously facing the problem 
of lack of investment and depressed yields and are in great need of modernization. The sector is 
dominated by millions of small and marginal farmers and mainly confined in the economically and 
ecologically vulnerable regions, plays a crucial role as far as the issue of sustainability is concerned. 
Plantation crops sector, in recent times is characterised by selective state intervention and the 
removal of tariff barriers wherein, its survival depends on international competitiveness. During the 
import substitution period, the role played by the plantation sector was very crucial in terms of 
foreign exchange earnings, but of late with a vibrant and dynamic service sector contributing a major 
chunk of export earnings coupled with a liberalized trade regime the importance of plantation sector 
has declined.  
 
39. As the crops with long duration and gestation period, plantation crops generally suffer from the 
disadvantage of low rejuvenation/replanting rate. Hence, majority of the plantations in the state are 
with senile and unproductive plants leading to low productivity and income. Moreover, 
predominance of small and marginal holdings adversely affects the adoption of technologies for 
higher productivity. Scarcity of regular skilled labour, which is expensive, also adversely affects the 
adoption of labour intensive scientific practices.  Majority of the plantation products are export 
oriented and hence their prices are highly influenced by the fluctuations in the international markets. 
Hence, the trade policies, especially regional trade agreements with competitive Asian countries had 
negative impacts in plantation economy of the state, further worsening the farmers’ plight. An 
important strategy of enhancing income of farmers in plantation sector is value addition through 
product diversification. However, the potential for value addition has not been effectively utilized in 
the sector. Interventions for plantation crops development have been mainly implemented through 
the respective commodity boards/ directorates and state sector schemes are limited without effective 
coordination with the other agencies. Taking into account the unique nature of the crops, strategies 
should envisage support programmes to sustain the livelihood during the gestation/price crash 
periods. The fact that programmes and recommendations in the past are not effectively reflected in 
the development of the sector highlights the importance of long term strategies and implementation 
without losing its continuity.  With this background, crop-wise scenario and strategies are briefed 
hereunder.  
 
Approaches  
 
40. Coconut. The traditional coconut farming in Kerala is an integral part of life, culture and identity of 
the people. In contrast to this, the current decade is witnessing mass withdrawal of people from this 
sector, despite the research outputs generated and extended by the research and developmental 
institutions. Hence, redemption of the traditional coconut farming and reorientation towards 
profitable ventures is becoming a necessity. For many years, Kerala ranked first in both area and 
production of coconut in the country. For instance, in the year 1990, Kerala accounted for 57 
percent area and 47 percent production of coconut in the country. However, Kerala’s share in area 
19 
as well as production of coconut is declining over time (during 2014-15 Kerala accounted for only 32 
percent area and 24 percent production in the country), and coconut growers are going through a 
crisis situation as they find it tough to manage the crop on a remunerative basis.  
 
41. Constraints such as high level of market fluctuation/price crash in coconut, changes in the 
demographic characteristics of coconut growers with a shift towards absentee landlordism, 
predominance of senile and unproductive palms, predominance of small and marginal holdings, over 
populated stands of both coconut and other trees in the homesteads, low level of adoption of crop 
management practices resulting in low productivity (as of now the productivity in Kerala is 7535 
nuts per ha, which is 27 percent lower than the national average), depletion of natural resources in 
coconut gardens and soil related constraints, inadequate irrigation facilities, lack of availability of 
quality planting materials,  lack of skilled labour and high wage rate, crop loss due to incidence of 
various pests and diseases, low level of  product diversification etc. adversely affects coconut farming 
in the state. And as such coconut has become a neglected crop in the ‘land of coconut’ without 
getting adequate care and management. Following problems have to be dealt during 13th plan period 
in the coconut sector, 
1. 
Recent studies conducted in northern Kerala revealed that incidence of pests and diseases in 
coconut gardens results in considerable economic loss. Thanjavur wilt and general yellowing 
were observed in many localities besides other pests and diseases.  
2. 
Competitiveness of coconut oil compared to palm oil in the domestic market gets adversely 
affected and the excessive import of palm oil would trigger price crash of coconut. During the 
oil year ended by October 2015 a total of 14.4 million MT of edible oil was imported of which 
the major item (9.5 million MT) was palm oil. Palm oil seems to be the major competing oil 
for coconut oil in the domestic market. There is a need to re-calibrate the import duty 
structure and it is essential that within the framework of permissible limits the tariff rates for 
the import of palm oil, both crude and refined palm oil are enhanced to protect the interests 
of coconut growers. 
3. 
The copra procurement system should be in such a fashion that the Minimum Support Price 
(MSP) ensures an incentive for processing to the coconut farmers when compared with that 
of selling fresh coconut. Cost of production of coconut in Kerala is Rs 8.29 per nut, wherein 
about 58 percent of the total cost is incurred is due to labour charges.  This shows the higher 
per unit labour charges prevailing in Kerala, which can be attributed to higher labour demand 
and higher cost of labour in Kerala. In addition, lack of availability of sufficient skilled 
labourers for harvesting of coconut leading to higher cost of cultivation of coconut in Kerala. 
Currently, wage rate prevailing in Kerala is around Rs 600 per day, which is one of the highest 
costs prevailing for agricultural labour in India. Cost of production of copra has been 
estimated as Rs 76/kg, and adding 20 percent margin to this, the MSP should be at least Rs 
91/kg. On the other hand the MSP fixed for the current season is only Rs59.50/kg of copra, 
which is certainly inadequate to support the coconut farmer. Other pertinent factors in this 
context of discussion are lack of effectiveness and efficiency in copra procurement by the 
agencies and inadequate infrastructural facilities for the storage of copra. It is noteworthy that, 
for the most part of the year, copra is traded below MSP. In order to create an impact in the 
market and for the benefits of MSP to reach the genuine coconut farmers, adequate quantity 
of copra should be procured. The studies on pattern of distribution of annual yield of coconut 
indicates that the number of nuts harvested varied from harvest to harvest and 60% of the 
production of a coconut palm is harvested during the peak production period i.e., the first six 
months of the calendar year, and hence a stable price during these periods is of utmost 
importance for achieving profitability in coconut based farming system. Hence, the copra 
20 
procurement scheme should be designed keeping view of this important aspect of coconut 
production in the country. 
4. 
In Kerala, the coconut procurement system through KrishiBhavans in association with 
KERAFED introduced in 2012-13 as a market intervention by state government has been 
beneficial to the coconut growers. However, to be effective necessary logistics are to be 
arranged for procurement of coconuts through all KrishiBhavans along with facilities for safe 
storage of nuts and also for primary processing of nuts into copra. Steps are also necessary to 
avoid delay in payment of prices to the coconut growers for the nuts procured.  
 
42. The foremost strategy for improving the coconut production in Kerala is the massive cutting and 
removal of senile and disease affected coconut palms which are beyond recovery, removal of over 
aged palms; regulating the palm density and replanting with high yielding planting materials along 
with adoption of suitable agro-management practices in farmer participatory cluster mode. Other 
strategies for betterment of coconut sector is listed below,  
1. 
Replacing old palms will require enormous quantity of seedlings. Hence, urgent action should 
be initiated for replanting such seed gardens with parental lines of new and improved varieties 
recommended for the respective regions. Further, to increase the capacity for hybrid seedling 
production, a decentralized production mechanism is to be envisaged by maintaining a 
centralized pollen storage and supply mechanism. 
2. 
Formation of third party monitoring/suggestive mechanism for the planting material 
production by the state department of agriculture.  
3. 
The early indications from the ongoing multi-institutional network project supported by State 
Planning Board running at six sites across the state reveals the possibility that alleviation of 
soil related constraints can regain health and productivity of the coconut palms. Hence, the 
set of best management practices to alleviate the soil related constraints which include 
amelioration of surface soil acidity with lime/dolomite and subsoil acidity with gypsum, 
external fertilizer inputs of not only NPK but also secondary nutrients calcium, magnesium 
and sulphur and micronutrients copper, zinc, molybdenum and chlorine, and additional input 
of chlorine through common salt apart from recycling of all the palm wastes to the basin 
needs to be promoted. Taking into consideration the shift of our society to a largely non-
agrarian one, an input delivery model, aiming to make available external inputs at the door 
step of the coconut farmers also needs to be promoted. These practices have to be scaled up 
through the ongoing ‘Keragramam’ scheme with the active involvement of coconut producer 
societies in a farmer participatory mode. 
4. 
Systematic coconut based cropping/integrated farming system as a strategy to make coconut 
farming economically viable in small holdings needs to be highlighted. This strategy is highly 
relevant since presently coconut growers in Kerala are more exposed to economic risks and 
uncertainties owing to the high degree of price fluctuations. 
5. 
Promote more entrepreneurs in coconut sector by establishing 'Coconut Parks' by state 
government for organized processing for value addition will help coconut farmers to de-link 
the over dependence on coconut oil in determining coconut price. In Kerala, there is 
tremendous potential for the development of coconut sector especially in view of the 
investment friendly ambience due to the organized coconut farmer groups. The state has 
already formed 7130 coconut producer’s societies (CPS), 452 coconut producer federations 
(CPFs) and 29 coconut producer companies (CPCs), and the potential for large scale 
operations in the coconut value added products is possible through harnessing the synergy of 
these CPCs. Support may be provided to value addition projects in coconut through the 
establishment of Coconut Parks. 
21 
6. 
Potential for production and marketing of neera is a strategic area which has raised lot of 
expectation. Value added products like coconut palm sugar, palm jaggery, coconut honey and 
coconut syrup can also be made from neera. Technologies are now available for preserving 
and packing coconut inflorescence sap as 'neera 'or sweet toddy as non-alcoholic health drink. 
Many of such federations have started producing and marketing neera. Efforts may be made 
by state government through Department of Agriculture to assess and refine the technologies 
made available for neera production so as to standardize the technologies for scaling up neera 
production on a commercially viable basis. 
7. 
Farmer participatory initiatives on a compact area basis are to be promoted for the integrated 
management of diseases like Thanjavur wilt and widespread yellowing of palms observed in 
northern districts of Kerala state.    
8. 
Identify the most favourable regions for large scale production and commercial integration 
and establish farmer participatory coconut parks. 
9. 
A novel policy initiative shall be chalked out to address the labour scarcity. Here we need to 
identify the status of traditional climbers, the societal acceptance of new climbers by breaking 
the cognitive beliefs and thrusting an overall reorientation of this pressing issue. LSGs can 
play a role in linking trained skilled palm climbers under schemes like Friends of Coconut 
Trees (FoCT) and coconut farmers by promoting labour bank concept under decentralized 
people's planning to address the problem of shortage of labour and high wage rate.  
10. Establishing block level/panchayat level hubs with forward and backward integration along 
with unit level collection centres under the supervision of CPS networks. 
11. Provide the mechanism to reflect trade concerns of Kerala in the forthcoming RPEC Free 
Trade Agreement. 
 
43. Natural Rubber. Kerala contributes 78 per cent of the total rubber production in the country. The 
state produced 5.07 lakh tonnes of Natural Rubber during 2014-15 which is 21 per cent lower than 
the previous year. NR sector contributed to around 25% of the agriculture GDP of the State during 
2013-14 (43 % during 2010-11). More than one million smallholders depend on rubber plantation 
for their livelihood. Rubber growers are small/marginal farmers with an average holding size of 0.54 
ha and rubber small growers’ net income has declined due to fall in price. Skill-gap on technology 
adoption and negative impact of climate change adversely affected production and productivity of 
natural rubber. Shift from massive production from estates to production by masses (small holders) 
necessitates change of the status of rubber cultivation as a standalone activity. Rubber, of late 
confronted with unprecedented crisis on account of the low level of market prices and subsequent 
menace.  
 
44. It is striking that for the past six years the rubber prices kept falling continuously. For instance, the 
average  market price per kilogram of rubber in the year 2011-12 was Rs 208 which nose-dived to Rs 
90/kg in the year 2016. It is an indubitable fact that the reason for price fall is the erroneous import 
policy adopted in the regime of trade liberalization and subsequent regional trade agreements. For 
instance, the quantity of import hovered around 25,000 in the 1990s has reached 1.9 lakh in the year 
2010 by the year 2015 reached up to 4.15 lakh tonnes. It is noteworthy that even in the case of 
synthetic rubber the imports are huge (seven lakh tonnes in the year 2014). It is worthwhile to note 
that, in India, we produce 95 per cent of the domestic requirement (10 lakh tonnes) of the natural 
rubber and hence the demand gap is only 0.5 lakh tonnes. Meanwhile the average annual import is 
more than 4 lakh tonnes. It is evident that there is no short cuts for elevating the natural rubber 
prices other than the complete ban on rubber imports, which unfortunately not the pragmatic 
solution in the as we are already embedded in several trade agreements. Timely replanting is another 
area of concern. The field level insights reveal that whenever the attractive rubber prices are 
22 
prevalent, producer tends to explore the maximum product from the tree, by postponing the 
replanting and in the event of price crash lack of interest in investment keep the replanting in 
abeyance, there by falling into a vicious cycle, in turn affecting the sustainable natural rubber 
production. In Kerala, as of now, the ageing plantations with low yielding trees do not hold the 
promise of a turn around. It is also observed that the rubber cultivation in the recent times shifting 
to low-cost countries and to non-traditional regions within the major rubber producing country.  
 
45. The potential for ancillary income generation in natural rubber sector for small holder empowerment 
through cultivating fruits and vegetables in young rubber plantations of Kerala state has to be 
utilised. Trials of Rubber Research Institute of India has proved that a variety of food crops such as 
upland rice, banana, pineapple, yam, ginger, turmeric and various vegetables can be successfully 
intercropped with young rubber plants during the initial 3-4 years. Similarly, feasibility of mixed 
cropping in mature rubber gardens with compatible crops also has to be explored. There is a need 
for convergence of schemes implemented by state government for promoting vegetable and fruit 
production with Rubber Board Schemes to utilize this potential. Following strategies have to be 
emphasized for improvement of the rubber sector in Kerala,  
1. 
Homestead rubber processing without required infrastructure and skills leads to inferior 
quality and heterogeneity of produce/ inconsistency in supply. Efforts are needed for 
realization of higher price and increasing income of rubber growers through quality up-
gradation of produce (Sheet rubber) by renovating/refurbishing the existing Group 
Processing Centres under Rubber Producer Societies (RPS) as growth centres. Emphasis is 
also required for skill up-gradation of labour in the tapping job so as to rectify the drawbacks 
and improve productivity for ensuring availability of superior quality produce (sheet) for 
manufacturers and better farm gate price realization to growers. Potential for linkage with 
NSDC/ PMKVY schemes can be utilised to implement such a skill development initiative in 
harvesting technology in NR sector. 
2. 
A consortium approach for raw material procurement and sale of output in the block rubber 
(TSR) and concentrated latex processing sectors is suggested to reap the advantages of scale 
economies. 
3. 
A comprehensive insurance programme shall be implemented that covers the price crash 
regime of the rubber. 
4. 
Historical trend analysis shows that the rubber prices had been always cyclical in nature and 
the recovery of price crash regime is imminent. Appropriate programme and schemes in the 
line of long term market intelligence is necessary to create awareness among stakeholders. 
 
46. Arecanut. This industry forms the economic backbone of nearly six million people in India and for 
many of them it is the sole means of livelihood. India ranks first in both area (49%) and production 
(49%) of arecanut. The world area and production of arecanut showed a tremendous increase during 
the last four decades. In India, arecanut is cultivated in an area of 453 thousand ha with an annual 
production of 632 thousand tonnes. Karnataka, Kerala, Assam and West Bengal are the major 
producers. Kerala accounts for 22% area and 20% production of arecanut in the country. 
 
47. Though the arecanut is not an export oriented crop, the internal demand has been always remained 
at higher levels. Stagnating market prices and increasing cost of production, especially the skilled 
labour charges in the recent times have generated livelihood concerns of arecanut farmers in India. 
Surging imports, which is around 12 percent of the domestic production, certainly has a significant 
role in price stickiness. It is a researched fact that more than 75% of the domestic arecanut trade is 
lies in the hands of private traders, wherein co-operatives have little bargaining position. This 
eventually results in frequent fluctuations in prices due to poor market intelligence, market hoarding 
23 
and imperfect market formation. The price spread analysis of arecanut indicated only a meager share 
of producer in the consumer price. These indiscriminate expansions of area under arecanut due to 
the remunerative price prevailed during the period of 1995 to 2000 have resulted in the surplus 
production of arecanut in the country. Though, alternative uses and medicinal values of arecanut 
have been reported viable technologies are yet to be developed on an industrial scale for exploiting it 
economically.  The methodologies for alternate uses are available but due to high cost of areca raw 
material the commercialization has not taken place. Social cost of arecanut promotion is another 
issue to ponder. Arecanut sector in India is facing a crisis owing to the policy level conflicts of 
interests and is a matter of concern for the millions of small and marginal farmers who are solely 
dependent on arecanut farming for their livelihood. On one hand the possible huge social cost of 
growing arecanut with all the existing institutional support for the crop, and on the other hand the 
possible marginalization of millions of farming community in the event of threats of partial or 
complete ban on the cultivation and allied activities of the crop are major issues to contemplate.  
 
48. Following strategies have been suggested for arecanut plantation, 
1. 
Keeping in view the recommendations of the Paulose Committee and Rathinam Committee 
and ground realities, further expansion of arecanut in non-traditional areas should be 
discouraged. Rejuvenation of senile and unproductive areca gardens with high yielding 
varieties/hybrids released by CPCRI is suggested. 
2. 
The technological interventions should be implemented through farmer participatory group 
approach.  Clusters of a contiguous area of 25 ha each is to be delineated and Community 
Based Organizations (CBOs) of farmers are to be formed to implement the interventions.  
3. 
Soil test based Integrated Nutrient Management practices; organic recycling through vermin 
composting of arecanut bio-waste etc. are excellent options for sustainable and efficient 
arecanut production. 
4. 
To reduce the cost of production and increase the unit level farm return arecanut based 
intercropping, mixed cropping and mixed farming should be practiced. 
5. 
Steps are to be taken to streamline the marketing systems by making it much more organized 
one. In the recent period, the low quality/low grade arecanut is imported to India in huge 
quantum. Therefore, adequate trade policy measures should be taken in this regard along with 
enforcing stringent food safety based trade barriers to safe guard the remunerative prices in 
the domestic sector. 
6. 
We need to have a futuristic vision to evolve integrated and scientifically planned areca based 
cropping models in the state which include livestock, fishery component, and staple food 
components. 
 
49. Coffee. Coffee in India is largely grown in the southern states of Karnataka (70%), Kerala (22%) and 
Tamil Nadu (7%). Small growers dominate the coffee sector both in terms of number of holdings 
and production. Kerala produces 68000 tonnes of coffee (21% of national production) from in 
84000 hectares. The productivity of coffee in Kerala in terms of bearing area is 781 kg/ha, which is 
lower than the national average (799 kg/ha). Internationally coffee has seen its production and 
export grow rapidly. But India’s share in standard compliant global production is only 2% and 
standard compliant production in India is only 15% of its national production (in Vietnam it is more 
than 30%). In Kerala Robusta variety of coffee is predominant (96%) while Arabica variety accounts 
for meagre 4%. It is a matter of concern that Robusta fetches comparatively lower prices and the 
brewing value is also less. As in the case of other plantation crops price volatility is a pressing issue in 
the case of coffee. Coffee procurement in Kerala is mostly oligopsonic in nature characterized by 
large number of small growers with very few buyers. Studies reveal that only 10% of coffee 
produced in the state is sold through auctions as most of the small growers prefer to sell the 
24 
unprocessed crop directly to buyer/agent. Predominance of small growers without effectively 
organized set up who depend heavily on private coffee buyers due to spot-cash requirement. This, in 
fact traps the coffee growers into a credit-interlocked dependency with the private buyers. Volatile 
prices in the liberalized market, a buyer driven-roaster controlled value chain, ineffective cooperative 
societies, labour scarcity, and credit-interlocked markets are all the issues to contemplate. 
 
50. Following are some strategies to strengthen the coffee production and marketing sector,  
1. 
Strengthen the existing coffee growers association and increase the number of such groups in 
the line of coconut producers’ societies/federations/companies through availing the ongoing 
scheme of Coffee Board in this regard. 
2. 
There has been, of late, a growing coffee consumption culture in the state and we are 
witnessing successful coffee chains establishing in the state (For instance, Café coffee day, 
Beans and flavours). We need to ensure the vertical integration (and horizontal through 
clusters/societies/federations) coffee growers in the state and equip them to form such coffee 
chains to reap the benefit of the vibrant domestic value chain. 
3. 
Average yield levels of Kerala are lower than that of the national level. It is also learned that 
60-70 per cent increase in yield can be obtained through proper irrigation of Robusta. This 
has to be further studied and appropriate recommendations have to be chalked out and 
implemented. 
4. 
A thorough scrutiny of existing schemes for replanting, water augmentation, 
quality/processing up-gradation and the extent of usage of these schemes in the state has to 
be carried out. The growers should be equipped to avail Integrated Coffee Development 
Project-Sub component- Replanting of the Coffee Board.  We also need to 
motivate/encourage farmers to replant the garden with Arabica variety of coffee. 
5. 
Encourage the market intelligence and price discovery mechanism through participation in 
online auction and future trading. In this respect awareness creation and plausible auction 
plan is required. 
6. 
Sustaining as a coffee producer and exporter entails production of standard compliant coffee, 
hence, optimal targets in phased manner has to be fixed for the production of standard 
compliant coffee. 
 
51. Cardamom. Small cardamom production in India is largely concentrated in the state of Kerala. The 
state has about 40,000 hectares of land under cardamom during 2014-15 which accounted for nearly 
60 per cent of the total area under small cardamom in India. The contribution of the state in total 
production of small cardamom was 87.6 per cent.  During the last 20 years, the crop has witnessed 
steady growth both in terms of output and productivity with compound annual growth rates of over 
4 per cent. But the area under the crop has witnessed a decline during the last two decades mirroring 
a similar decline at the national level.  The area under cardamom which was 66,000 hectares during 
1990-91 has come down to 40,000 hectares. More than 90 per cent of area under cardamom is 
located in Idukki and Wayanad districts of Kerala. The productivity of the crop has shown a high 
tendency for instability during the last three decades with a high coefficient of variation. This 
indicates the occurrence of fluctuation in the farm profits for the producers and the influence of 
weather parameters in determining production. The small cardamom exports from India earned a 
value of INR 3,234 million during 2014-15, the bulk of which originated in Kerala. The cardamom 
produce from the state has a better quality in comparison to the produce from Gautemala, India’s 
major competitor in the cardamom export market. Given the agro-climatic limitations for horizontal 
expansion as a strategy for enhancing cardamom production, the crop offers good potential for 
creative utilization and development in supporting the farm livelihood security of cardamom 
producing regions in Kerala.   
25 
 
52. The following aspects of the crop sector needs to be addressed/focused to strengthen the small 
cardamom economy of the state, 
1. 
More than 80 per cent of the area under cardamom in Kerala is planted with a single farmer 
variety, Njallani type. This poses a threat to cardamom biodiversity. Several farmer varieties 
are available in cardamom which needs to be conserved to enhance varietal diversity. Targeted 
schemes for incentivizing on farm conservation and in-situ conservation and promotion of 
varietal diversity need to be implemented.  
1. 
Alternate varieties for popularization at Idukki- ICRI-2, ICRI-5, ICRI-6, PV 1, PV 2  
2. 
Alternate varieties for popularization at Wayanad-Appangala-1, Appangala-2, ICRI-2, 
ICRI-5, ICRI-6, PV 1, PV 2  
2. 
Identification of strains and crop management practices for inducing synchronized flowering 
so that harvesting cycles can be reduced leading to saving in labour cost 
3. 
The farmer variety Njallani is noted for its high input responsiveness. The geographical spread 
of the crop has lead to predominance of high input intensive practices across the cardamom 
growing tracts of the state. An alternate system of production need to be made available for 
those who opt for low input intensive /sustainable practices.  
4. 
Though seedlings of cardamom can be used as a planting material, suckers from mother 
plants are more suitable as planting material. The planting material supply system in 
cardamom needs critical interventions to ensure availability of a wide choice of varieties for 
cardamom farmers.  
5. 
Experiments have demonstrated that judicious use of pesticides at the correct time can reduce 
the need for pesticide sprays in cardamom to 4-6 rounds of spraying. The demonstration of 
this technology needs to be taken up urgently along with sensitization efforts among farmers 
and agricultural department personnel to reduce the pesticide load in the cardamom 
production ecosystems.  
6. 
At present, Alleppey Green Cardamom is the only Geographical Indication available in 
cardamom. Considering the limited geographical spread and distinct pockets where cardamom 
is being grown in Kerala, the possibilities for availing GI registration need to be taken up. 
This will help in creating a brand identity and provide an opportunity for premium pricing of 
the produce.  
7. 
The small cardamom is a labour intensive crop (several rounds of picking/trashing/plant 
protection operations). Strategic agronomic management for rationalizing labour use need to 
be implemented.   
8. 
Targeting development of varieties tolerant to thrips should be given priority in research. In 
the emerging scenario where environmental pollution arising from pesticide use and pest 
residues in produce are major concerns, yield parameter alone might not be a suitable 
indicator for varietal suitability.  
9. 
Supplementary fertilizer application to supply micronutrients can enhance crop health and 
enhance productivity. Incentives for promoting adoption of soil test based nutrient 
application schedule are needed. 
10. Currently, the share of value added products from cardamom in total cardamom exports is 
less than 10 per cent whereas it is more than 30 per cent in crops like black pepper and 
cinnamon.  This indicates a latent potential for strengthening the cardamom value chain 
through post harvest processing and value addition.  
11. Since the picked cardamom needs to be processed immediately, availability of processing 
facility (driers) is critical to ensure production of clean good quality produce. The availability 
of processing facility in Wayanad and some places in Idukki need to be strengthened through 
cooperative efforts.         
26 
 
53. Cashew. India is the third largest producer of cashew nut in the world and accounts for one-fifth of 
the total area under cashew cultivation in the world. The productivity of cashew in India is lower 
than the world average. Till late 1980s, Kerala was the leader in area and production of cashew in the 
country. Today, although the state is the major processing and export hub, it loses out in terms of 
total production. Kerala accounts for 11 per cent of cashew production in India and stands fourth in 
terms of production after Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. Cashew production in Kerala is 
low due to the constraints, viz. predominance of senile plantations, planted under degraded lands in 
neglected conditions; heavy yield loss due to outbreak of tea mosquito bug and absence of dwarf and 
compact high yielding varieties. At the same time, the processing capacity of cashew industry is 
much higher than domestic availability and hence we had to depend on imports of raw nuts from 
overseas. The USA is the major buyer of processed cashew kernels from India (36 percent of Indian 
export) followed by UAE and Japan.  Of late, it has become extremely tough to attract the 
youngsters into the cashew industry, especially due to the poor working conditions prevailing in the 
sector. Therefore, the migrant labourers from North and North-Eastern states are trained and 
recruited in the industry. As a matter of fact, the cashew processing industry in Kerala has to 
compete with the processing units in other states that offer comparatively lower wages with no 
commitment on social protection and welfare measures. This in turn affects the cost competitiveness 
of the state. As of now the cashew sector in the state is faced with several challenges; most 
importantly, the scarcity of raw material is a menace, especially in the context of very high installed 
processing capacity in the state. The backwardness of the processing industry in terms of 
infrastructural facilities, operating environment, hygiene and quality standards are grave concerns in 
view of the stringent international food safety regime. The value addition and product diversification 
of cashew apple and cashew kernel is meager in the state that certainly acts as a major hindrance for 
the value chain up-gradation. 
 
 
54. Following are the strategies to be encouraged in cashew sector of Kerala, 
1. 
Replace all senile and seedling plantations by high yielding varieties, promote nurseries for 
raising quality planting materials of recommended varieties to meet the requirement. 
2. 
Adoption of high density planting system is a major option to increase the productivity of 
cashew and farmers income. In general, planting density of 384 plants/ ha (6.5 m x 4 m), 400 
plants/ ha (5 m x 5 m) and 400 plants/ ha (5 m x 4 m) give two times more yield than normal 
planting density of 156 plants/ ha (8 m x 8m). 
3. 
Un-used lands in regions with low soil fertility and hard lateritic areas could be converted to 
cashew plantations. 
4. 
With regard to the cashew processing, states other than Kerala have almost completely 
mechanized their cashew processing. We are backward in this respect mainly due to cost of 
investment and the apprehensions on broken kernels resulting from machine processing. We 
need to urgently address this issue and seek possible options for complete mechanization. 
5. 
It is fact that the public sector player in the cashew industry-Kerala State Cashew 
Development Corporation (KSDC) has been incurring losses for several years due to the 
inability in raising sufficient working capital. This issue should be addressed at the earliest to 
make KSDC as a role model employer in the cashew sector of the state. 
6. 
Worldwide, Steaming method of cashew processing is considered to be more hygienic than 
the traditional method that Kerala industry is practicing. Keeping in view the sanitary and 
phyto-sanitary issues and emerging food safety stringency we need to adopt more hygienic 
measures at processing node. 
27 
7. 
There is a need to promote the domestic consumption of cashew in the state through 
elevating the aggregate demand. We need to tap the niche segment in this regard through 
more aggressive promotional strategies. 
8. 
To improve/upgrade the working conditions, the state machinery may provide one-time 
subsidized grant to the employer to modernize the infrastructural facilities and processing 
practices. 
9. 
Alternate approaches to develop value added products from the broken kernels (30-40 per 
cent loss during processing) through linkages CFTRI Mysore wherein they have already 
developed product lines of this kind. 
 
55. Tea. India contributes 1/4th of the world tea production. Kerala accounts for 6.3 per cent of total tea 
production in the country and five per cent of the total area under tea in the country. The market 
prices of the tea was favourable during early 1990s that hovered around Rs 70/kg but in subsequent 
years the price went down and reached around RS 50/kg. Thus the prices are lowest levels in the 
recent period and even the exports came down from 25 per cent of the domestic production to 18 
per cent during the year 2014-15. In Kerala, the tea companies have neglected timely replanting and 
as a consequence, the tea gardens in the state are predominantly old.  Low prices and high cost are 
the major issues confronted in the sector. Besides, archaic labour law, and withdrawal of small 
holder from the sector are concerns. The studies indicate already around 30 per cent of the small 
owners have exited the business. Eighty per cent of the domestic market is dominated by Assam tea 
that priced at Rs 140/kg, Tamil Nadu tea fetches Rs 100/kg and Kerala tea loses out in this aspect. 
Lack of reinvestment in the tea plantation, and timely replanting when the prices are high have 
caused irreparable damage to the sector. The companies while reaping benefits when the prices were 
good had never cared for improving the quality standards or developing a tea brand and eventually 
we are out of the competition. 
 
56. Strategies for tea sectors is listed as below: 
1. 
Action plans need to be formulated and implemented with optimal yearly targets and a time 
bound long term strategy to increase the productivity through replanting, rejuvenation, 
pruning, infilling and shading with trees, and increasing organic content of soil by burial of 
pruning. 
2. 
On the production front, alongside replacing old bushes with highly productive new varieties 
of cloned tea, a plan for targeted replanting subsidy should be formulated. 
3. 
A comprehensive ‘Munnar package’ should be developed to provide assured reasonable wages 
to the plantation workers and eliminate the prevailing wage discrimination practices, which  
also comprising modalities for strict monitoring of the compliance regarding the social 
security, health, education and welfare of the plantation workers.  
4. 
Even with the existing senile bushes and prevailing low prices of tea, if productivity can be 
increased, higher earnings can be ensured to the worker. Considering the tough terrains, 
mechanization is limited in Kerala, especially Munnar conditions and it is impossible to expect 
an increase in the daily harvest of the worker.  The scenario necessitates an orientation 
towards innovative marketing strategies by reducing the dependence on auction sales alone. 
5. 
It is a known fact that some of the gardens in Munnar produce the world’s highest- grown tea 
and the niche market in this respect is so far unexplored. Keeping view of the possible 
collective ownership by majority women workers in long run,  an action plan to create a new 
brand through collaboration with the network of Kudumbasree, the women’s’ self-help 
groups of Kerala should be prepared and implemented. 
6. 
Chalk out a programme to ensure a rightful share in the earnings of the tourist economy 
through exploring the potential of agro-eco-tourism in tea growing tracts of Kerala. Here we 
28 
need to formulate a self-sustaining project led by women’s initiative, youth, tribal people, 
along with representatives from state machineries, agricultural scientists, and ecologists. 
 
57. Cocoa. Across the world, cocoa is grown in 58 countries in around 10 million hectares with an 
estimated production of 4.36 million tonnes. Among the major countries, Côte d’Ivoire has the 
highest productivity of 660 kg/ha, while the world productivity is 504 kg/ha. The four West African 
countries viz., Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Cameroon and Nigeria contributed for 73.3% of worldwide 
cocoa production. In India, cocoa is cultivated mainly in the states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, 
Kerala, and Karnataka.  India produced 15,133 tonnes of cocoa from an area of 71,245 hectares in 
2014-15. Tamil Nadu has the highest area under cocoa (33.6%), followed by Andhra Pradesh 
(31.1%), and in the case of cocoa production, Kerala has the major share (41.8%) followed by 
Andhra Pradesh (37.0%). The cocoa industry in the country had expanded to a considerable extent 
in recent years. At present more than 15 industrial entrepreneurs and firms existing in the field 
demanding nearly 30,000 tonnes of cocoa beans of which the present domestic availability is only 
about 40 percent. Considering the market growth in the chocolate segment In India, which is about 
20 percent per annum, cocoa has a great potential to develop in future years.  
 
58. On the other hand, there are emerging and evolving hurdles to cross, in the forms of highly 
fluctuating international prices for the commodity, ever increasing mergers and acquisitions in the 
cocoa industry, lack of high-level technical competence and entrepreneurship in the domestic sector. 
To make cocoa farming more profitable, farmers need to produce more cocoa. Average productivity 
increases when entrepreneurial farmers are trained to use inputs such as fertilizer and better cocoa 
varieties. Domestic supply chain of cocoa in India is still in rudimentary stages. CAMPCO and 
Cadbury India Ltd (now Mondelez India) are the major procuring agencies in India, who are directly 
procuring the cocoa beans from farmers.  The value share of the producer/farmer is a meager 32% 
because most of the farmers sell the produce as wet beans, even without doing minimal processing. 
Drying yards, primary processing facilities, and storage facilities are lacking in the case of most of the 
cocoa farmers. Since the stringent food safety standards and trace back systems are evolving in 
international arena, it is a real challenge to establish robust procuring system in the upstream end of 
the cocoa value chain in the country. 
 
59. Strategies to be followed for cocoa development is as follows, 
1. 
Cocoa is an important commodity traded in the international stock exchanges. In the 
domestic level also we may formulate a producer consortium to facilitate the future trading 
and stock investment of cocoa beans, and there by combat the speculative price movements 
to a large extent. Risk aversion mechanisms should be adequately taken while advising the area 
expansion programmes on cocoa wherein we should discourage the monocropping of cocoa. 
2. 
Urgent steps should be taken to establish village level primary processing units and capacity 
building for fermentation and drying of cocoa beans with the formation of strong farmer 
aggregates, women SHG’s and rural youths. Development of exclusive market yards and 
assembling places for cocoa beans along with the adoption of high quality food safety 
standards would be a pro-active step for better realization of bean prices.  
3. 
Assured buy-back systems developed in the frame of contract farming under the stake of 
government (tripartite arrangement) can help the growth of the sector. State machinery should 
go for Memorandum of Understanding with the leading chocolate manufacturers for 
appropriate marketing arrangements and supply chain development.  
4. 
Sustainable cocoa production wherein cocoa is produced without chemicals and devoid of 
child labour is gaining popularity all over the world. We may explore this opportunity because 
India is one among the few countries where cocoa is produced without engaging child labour 
29 
and moreover, a major cocoa growing district in Kerala (Kasaragod) is a declared as an 
organic district. On a pilot basis, we may explore this opportunity by popularizing the organic 
cocoa and may endeavour for organic/sustainable certification. 
 
Fruits 
 
60. Major fruits cultivated in the state are Banana, Mango, Pine apple, Jack fruit and papaya and the 
cumulative area under cultivation of these crops is 3.09 lakh ha. As compared to national 
productivity, the state average yield is very low reflecting the poor attention given to these crops. 
Crop-wise opportunities and challenges are summarised below. 
 
61. Banana. Availability of unique varieties like Nendran and shade tolerant homestead varieties and rich 
varietal diversity are the strengths of the crop in addition to its scope in processing industry by way 
of utilization of wafers and fibre from pseudostem. Some of the challenges of growing the crop 
include non-availability of quality suckers and virus free tissue cultured planting materials leading to 
wide use of diseased suckers from Tamil Nadu; Low productivity; and high yield loss due to pests 
and diseases and other natural calamities coupled with lack of crop insurance programmes.  
 
62. Mango. Commercial Mango orchards are confined to Muthalamada of Palakkad district. Rich varietal 
diversity and popularisation of Mango fest promoted by KTDC are the positives to be tapped and 
strengthened in the future. Non-availability of quality grafts; under-exploitation of pickle type 
varieties in social forestry planting programmes; Non- scientific use of chemicals for artificial 
ripening; and irregular bearing are the challenges to be addressed.  
 
63. Pineapple. Pine apple has the advantage of high productivity as compared to other fruit crops. It is 
preferred due to varietal diversity, including export oriented Mauritius variety; and low pest and 
disease. It can be cultivated anywhere in the state (from low land to upland). Some of the constraints 
in pine apple cultivation includes lack of support for planting in rubber plantations; and 
indiscriminate use of ethrel as flowering agent. 
 
64. Jack fruit. Jack fruit is an integral component of homesteads. Rich diversity and highly remunerative 
timber value are the attractions. Heavy post -harvest loss, maturing late after the onset of monsoon 
resulting in reduced fruit quality; and non- availability of quality grafts are the challenges.  
 
65. Papaya. Papaya is restricted to homesteads and kitchen gardens without any major commercial 
orchards in the state. Heavy incidence of mosaic and mealy bugs, lack of quality seeds of dwarf types 
are the problems faced by farmers. 
 
66. Exotic fruits. Scope for mangostein, rambutan, pulasan, durian and avocado and Strawberry (in high 
ranges) as fresh fruits in domestic and export market and in processing industry are to be explored. 
Making quality grafts and air layers available is a challenge. 
 
67. Strategies. Following are the identified strategies for fruit sector in Kerala, 
1. Considering the issues and challenges of the fruit sector in the state, following strategies are 
suggested for the future. 
2. Expanding fruit cultivation to the low and mid hill region in commercial scale;  Promotion of 
minor hardy fruits in homesteads; and identifying the blocks for growing appropriate fruit crops 
and ensure planting material supply, Production infrastructure, Technical know –how; and supply 
of inputs.  
30 
3. Updating progeny gardens of DOA and KAU farms with HYV. Open jail at Cheemeni, 
Kasaragod district can be entrusted with task of establishing largest field gene bank and progeny 
mango orchards in South India. 
4. Implementing Schemes for ‘Fruits for eco-restoration’; replacing eucalyptus and acacia with Jack 
fruits and minor fruit trees for afforestation, along with apiculture promotion  to address man –
animal conflict and ensure income for state and tribal population. 
5. Setting up model fruit and vegetable villages under KVK and developing farmer markets for 
fruits attached to KVK of each District. 
6. Creation of proper storage facilities (low cost storages & Cold stores) for judicious utilization of 
the harvested produce and smooth running of the processing units and strengthening marketing 
channels.  
7. Value addition of Jack fruit and minor fruits; and extracting high value products from garcinia, 
kokum and tamarind for revenue and ensuring employment to women and upgradation of 
processing units.  
8. Formation of Growers’ cooperatives or growers' companies, strengthening Public-Private 
Partnership models for enhancing commercial cultivation and contract farming.  
 
Medicinal Plants 
 
68. The National Medicinal Plants Board take up programmes for conservation, proper harvest 
management, cost effective cultivation, research and development, processing and marketing of raw 
materials of medicinal plants. In Kerala, schemes for scientific cultivation, processing and marketing 
of medicinal plants on commercial basis were undertaken since 2009.  Some of the interventions 
include empowerment of Schedule Tribes; cultivation of medicinal plants in Jails; and establishment 
of model nurseries in research institutes and agricultural farms with 100% assistance. For 
commercial cultivation of medicinal plants, a subsidy rate of 30%, 50% and 75% to crops of high 
demand, endangered and highly endangered species, respectively and till now a total of 533.26 ha of 
area has been cultivated on cluster basis with assistance of Rs 14.24crores. To ensure market for the 
produce, MoUs have been signed with the major Ayurvedic Pharmaceutical Companies. 
 
69. Major challenges in the sector include lack of facilities for collection and transportation of the raw 
material produced by the farmer clusters; difficulty in setting up of processing units based on SPV 
mode as prescribed in the NMPB guidelines; lack of support for crops those are in demand by the 
Kerala Ayurveda Industry; Lack of technical knowledge on GAP of medicinal plants; bureaucratic 
procedural delays; and low private sector participation in the schemes. 
 
70. Strategies. Following points should be emphasized for improvement of medicinal plant sector in 
Kerala,  
1. 
Assistance should be provided to additional crops that have demand in the Kerala Ayurveda 
Industry 
like 
Vetiveriazizanioides, 
Kaempheria 
rotunda, 
Pseudarthriaviscida,Cycleapeltata 
, 
Justiciaadathoda, Trichosanthes sp. 
2. 
Reforming the norms for setting up PHM units apart from SPV mode as prescribed in the 
NMPB guidelines. 
3. 
Conduct awareness programmes at various levels. 
4. 
Setting up Collection centres & transportation facility (viz. mobile vending cart) at cluster level 
for easy marketing of raw materials. 
5. 
A campaign on the theme of “back to nature” should be initiated to popularise medicinal 
plants cultivation in homesteads through KrishiBhavans and KAU farms. 
31 
6. 
Since there is no established marketing channels locally, district level procurement 
arrangements through selected agencies in association with National Horticultural 
Board/Department of Ayurveda (Ayush)/Oushadi should be implemented. 
7. 
Marketing channels for procuring raw, dried herbs for traditional, alternate and modern 
medicine streams needs to be explored at the state level. 
8. 
With support of KAU and KVKs,  training on medicinal value of these plants, scientific 
cultivation, pest and disease management, processing techniques have to be given to farmers 
by the Agricultural department. 
 
Floriculture 
 
71. In India, floriculture comprises flower trade, production of nursery plants and potted plants, seed 
and bulb production, micro propagation and extraction of essential oils. Though the annual 
domestic demand for the flowers is growing at a rate of over 25% and international demand at 
around Rs 90,000 crores, India’s share in international market of flowers is negligible (0.61%). 
However, India is having a better scope in the future as there is a shift in trend towards tropical 
flowers and this can be gainfully exploited by country like India with high amount of diversity in 
indigenous flora. 
 
72. The agro-climatic situations in Kerala are ideal for production of flower crops, especially around 
homesteads in open and under protected conditions. The important flowers traded in our state are 
marigold, chrysanthemum, jasmine, lily, lotus, vadamulla, anthurium, and orchids. Out of the 61389 
quintals of flowers traded in the state, 5.07% is chrysanthemum, 1.74% ixora, 22.84% jasmine, 
2.67% lily, 15.18% marigold, 3.99% vadamulla and 47.65% other flowers. About 96% of flowers are 
distributed by agents of which 33.18% is from within the state and rest is from outside.  Kerala has 
lessons to learn from the small state Sikkim in how to flourish in terms of employment and income 
generation through introduction and export-oriented cultivation of just one single flower crop, the 
orchids, as a lucrative livelihood for rural women. Having recently recognized the potential of its 
orchid industry, the state government has identified orchid industry as the priority area in their 
agricultural policy planning and maximum funds are allocated for promoting commercial cultivation 
of orchids. Given its orchid-growing potential, Kerala can be at the forefront of the international 
orchid trade. Cultivation of flowers will not only generate employment opportunities and bring high 
return for the farmers but also reduce the import and save foreign currency. High ranges of Kerala, 
the most ideal region for commercializing flowers, remain as a potential zone still to be exploited. 
Strategies have to be streamlined to ensure dissemination of technological ideas about flower 
farming in already existing plantations as a profitable intercrop. Side by side, innovation of ways and 
means for further expansion of floriculture as a profitable venture can be developed. All that it 
requires is addressing a few structural issues. A booming floriculture industry would not only do 
wonders for the local economy but also add another dimension to the State’s efforts on women 
empowerment. 
 
73. Strategies. Strategies for floriculture is listed below, 
1. 
Sensible crop diversification to accommodate high value crops in existing plantations as well 
as in every homestead becomes a promising solution if applied logically. The high ranges of 
Kerala, especially the hill districts, Wayanad and and Idukki represent the most potential 
agricultural zone in the state for promoting agri-tourism and floriculture as lucrative enterprise 
to generate employment and income.  
2. 
Floriculture has a vital role to play in the socio-economic uplift of the rural folks of the state 
because of its capacity for income generation and employment generation, particularly for 
32 
rural women, leading to poverty reduction. Developing a strategy for rural development 
through floriculture-based hi-tech farming for netting a strong platform around the concept 
of rural tourism will be the most ideal. In this context, commercial floriculture under hi-tech 
mode in a flori-Village format through KVKs and research centres has relevance. 
3. 
Strengthen homestead - based floriculture of both conventional and cut-flowers especially 
gerbera, gladiolus, irish lily, orchids, anthurium, marigold and chrysanthemums  
4. 
Capacity building for small/youth entrepreneurs and women in scientific flower production 
and utilization. 
5. 
Implementation of the floriculture development programme in the state will help to meet the 
season- bound requirement of flowers in the state and save state revenue through import 
substitution. Additional income generation through sale of planting materials can also be 
strengthened. 
 
Organic Farming and Good Agricultural Practices 
 
74. Organic agriculture generally implies alternate modes of agricultural production, which denounce the 
use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, plant growth regulators, and livestock feed additives. It is 
essential that the virtues attributed to organic farming need to be rechecked before promoting it as 
the only policy option or as a complementary option. Although increased attention is paid to organic 
components, particularly in soil fertility management and pest control, integration is the key in 
sustainable agriculture. Integrated nutrient management, integrated pest management, integrated 
weed management, integrated watershed management, and better land husbandry are some of such 
concepts. Along with the changes in farming styles, steps should also be taken to improve food 
distribution system, reduce food wastage, close the yield gaps, shift diets away from meat, and use 
resources much more efficiently. These strategies, if implemented based on sustainable principles, 
could double food production while greatly reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture. With 
a growing population and precarious food situation, we cannot afford to take risk with organic 
farming alone. A holistic approach involving integrated nutrient management, integrated pest 
management, enhanced input use efficiency and adoption of region-specific promising cropping 
systems would be the best farming strategy. Good practices related to soil include maintaining or 
improving soil organic matter through the use of soil carbon-build up by appropriate crop rotations, 
manure application, pasture management and other land use practices; rational mechanical and/or 
conservation tillage practices; maintaining soil cover to provide a conducive habitat for soil biota, 
minimizing erosion losses by wind and/or water; and application of organic and mineral fertilizers 
and other agro-chemicals in amounts and timing and by methods appropriate to agronomic, 
environmental and human health requirements. Careful management of water resources and efficient 
use of water are needed for both rain fed and irrigated crops. Good practices related to crop 
production begin by selecting cultivars of crops based on their characteristics including response to 
sowing or planting time, productivity, quality, market acceptability and nutritional value; disease and 
stress resistance; edaphic and climatic adaptability; and response to fertilizers and agrochemicals. 
Crop sequences must be devised to optimize use of labour and equipment and maximize the 
biological benefits of weed control by competition, mechanical, biological, and herbicide options. 
Provision must be given by using non-host crops to minimize diseases. Wherever appropriate, 
include legumes to provide a biological source of nitrogen. Regarding fertilizers, use organic and 
inorganic sources in a balanced way with appropriate methods and equipment and at adequate 
intervals to replace nutrients extracted by harvest or lost during production. Such a practice will 
maximize the benefits to soil and nutrient stability by re-cycling crop and other organic residues. 
Integrate livestock into crop rotations and utilize the nutrient cycling provided by grazing or housed 
livestock to benefit the fertility of the entire farm. Rotating livestock on pastures allow for healthy 
33 
re-growth of pasture. Adhere to safety regulations and observe established safety standards for the 
operation of equipment and machinery for crop and fodder production.  
 
Organic Farming Options for Kerala 
 
75. Organic farming policy, strategy, and detailed action plan for Kerala State was declared during 2010 
with a vision to make Kerala’s farming sustainable, rewarding, and competitive, ensuring toxin-free 
water, soil, and food to every citizen. The general approach for implementing the strategies and 
action plan emphasized that the mission to convert Kerala into an organic State is to be achieved 
focusing on potential crops and areas in a phased and compact manner with the aim of converting a 
minimum of 10 per cent of the cultivable land into fully organic every year and thus achieving the 
target within five to ten years.  
 
76. Kasargod, the northern most district of the state was declared as a fully organic farming district in 
2012-13.  The programme in the district is being implemented through the formation of farmer’s 
clusters. Financial assistance is provided for registration of new clusters and strengthening of old 
clusters. Financial assistance is also provided for organic cultivation, on farm production of organic 
inputs, opening of eco-shops, and for organic certification. The Participatory Guarantee System 
(PGS) of certification was introduced in the district in 2014 and the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion 
Council of Kerala (VFPCK) was declared as the implementing agency of the programme with the 
mandate of bringing all the vegetable crops under certification. In the other 13 districts of the state, 
‘Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and ‘Safe to Eat Food Production’ programme was 
implemented from 2015 onwards directly by the Department of Agriculture. In parallel to GAP and 
safe to eat food production, PGS is also adopted for organic certification in these 13 districts directly 
by the Department of Agriculture.  
 
77. The organic farming policy (2010) envisaged that on completion of the third year of implementation 
of the organic farming policy, a committee of experts comprising representatives of farmers and 
scientists should make a comprehensive assessment of the farmer’s well-being, economy, and 
environment; and only after rectifying the drawbacks, if any, can the policy be implemented in rest 
of the areas. However, such an evaluation has not been undertaken so far. 
 
78. The suggested measures for regulating the distribution and use of pesticides are not implemented 
and as such farmers get whatever pesticides available from the dealers without any 
prescriptions/recommendations of Agricultural Officers. Lack of proper technical support, 
especially in the changing climatic situations, has resulted in a dip in the confidence level of farmers 
in pursuing organic mode of farming practices.   Constraints experienced by the farmers due to yield 
reduction during the conversion period and problems in marketing of organic produce could not be 
addressed by the Department of Agriculture because of non-implementation of the envisaged 
project activities. 
 
79. Transition to organic farming is a continuous process and mechanism to provide technical support 
and financial incentives has to be in place on a continuous basis rather than certain disconnected 
activities.  If the conversion phase is not guided on a regular continuous manner the whole process 
has to start afresh.  Delay in proper implementation of project activities has adversely affected the 
sustainability of the initiatives to promote organic farming. 
 
80. A positive outcome is that after the commencement of the organic farming initiatives by the 
government, there is increased awareness among farmers regarding the ill effects of indiscriminate 
34 
and unscientific use of chemical pesticides and the need to shift towards eco-friendly organic 
practices.  However, majority of farmers are not properly educated about the appropriate farming 
practices to be adopted for raising different crops.  Further, the inputs recommended for crop and 
soil health management under organic system are not available in required quality and quantity.  This 
situation has given opportunities for unscrupulous elements to flood the market with products of 
questionable properties. Most often, organic inputs supplied by various agencies are of inferior 
quality.  A continuous and intensive quality control mechanism is needed to prevent exploitation by 
such elements. 
 
81. Some farmers from Kasaragod procure chemical pesticides from neighbouring districts when their 
crops are threatened with pests and diseases.  They are forced to resort to this practice as there are 
no viable substitutes to manage pests and diseases to save the crops in the organic way, especially 
when the incidence is severe. Moreover, farmers find it difficult to get the promised “premium 
price” for the produce and not in a position to compete with the farmers following conventional 
farming methods. For managing sudden outbreak of pests and diseases in crops, there are no viable 
organic methods. Since chemical options are not permitted, farmers suffer economic losses. 
Although only red and yellow categories of pesticides are banned in the district, farmers are unable 
to use other less toxic pesticides since the Department of Agriculture is not giving any support to the 
farmers for such uses, resulting in large scale crop damage and economic loss.  
 
82. Efficacy of the recommended organic methods of pest and disease management have not been 
properly tested under the different agro-ecological situations of the state. Although Kerala 
Agricultural University (KAU) has come up with an adhoc Package of Practices for organic 
agriculture, most of them still remain adhoc, and adequate experiments have not been conducted to 
prove their efficacy in farmer’s fields through systematic technology assessment and refinement. 
Hence, there is an urgent need to intensify research for evolving appropriate organic farming 
technologies for the management of pests and diseases of crops and to validate their field efficacy. 
 
83. Low fertility status of soils in the district adversely affect the productivity of crops besides increasing 
pest and disease incidence problems due to nutritional deficiency, which   are expressed as various 
signs and symptoms in plants. Economically viable organic substitutes for plant nutrients are yet to 
be worked out and freely available. Nutrition of plants has substantial impacts on the predisposition 
of plants to attack by pests and diseases. For example, one of the factors attributed to the 
widespread incidence of bud rot in the hilly terrains of Kerala is deficiency of calcium, potassium, 
and boron. Similarly, in banana, sigatoka disease incidence is increased by the deficiency of Ca, K 
and Mg. Therefore, application of these nutrients as chemical fertilizers cannot be withdrawn 
abruptly. Otherwise yield reduction will be substantial resulting in huge economic losses to the 
farmers. The present status of production of organic inputs clearly indicates the non- availability of 
the above inputs in sufficient quantity. 
 
84. It is better to start organic farming with low volume high value crops like spices, medicinal plants, 
and aromatic crops. There will also be scope for practicing organic farming on case-to-case basis in 
traditional strongholds like hilly areas, rain fed and dry land farming system to cater to the demands 
of organic produces in urban areas who would pay premium prices for such commodities.  
 
85. If somebody wants to go in for organic farming, primarily on commercial consideration or profits 
motive or to take advantage of the unusually higher prices of organic food, they must be encouraged 
to do so. In Kerala, traditional organic farming may prevail in certain areas where modern methods 
are consciously avoided, for example, Pokkali rice, scented rice, and medicinal plants.  
35 
 
86. Along with organic farming, GAP must also be promoted as an alternative to conventional 
agriculture. 
 
Strategies for 13th Five Year Plan 
 
87. Following are the recommended strategies regarding organic agriculture and GAP in Kerala, 
1. 
Instead of spending the available resources to bring all cultivated area in the state under 
organic farming programme, the approach should be to focus on potential crops and areas in 
a phased and compact manner, for example, with low volume high value crops like spices, 
medicinal plants, and aromatic crops. 
2. 
Specific prgrammes may be chalked out in traditional organic farming sectors where modern 
methods are consciously avoided, for example, Pokkali rice, Kaipad rice, Njavara, scented rice, 
and medicinal plants.  
3. 
All support and encouragement shall be given to organic farming based on National 
Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) standards and third party certification intended 
mainly for export. Certification agencies accredited under NPOP issue the third party organic 
certificates. The certified produces can cater to the domestic market also for those who can 
afford to pay premium prices.  
4. 
Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) is an alternate and complimentary tool to third party 
certification. Most farmers in the state are small holders, therefore, the PGS is highly suited 
for spreading organic cultivation and certification in the state. PGS certification is mainly 
intended for domestic markets. The quality assurance standards are harmonised by the PGS 
Organic Council, which permits the use of its PGS label on a product as a mark of quality.  
5. 
A method of certification for GAP, which is both farmer-friendly and eco-friendly is essential 
for spreading the message of sustainable and eco-friendly farming among the farmers and for 
getting better prices for their produces. Certification based on ‘Good Agricultural Practices 
(GAP)’ is the ideal choice in this context. The benefits of organic agriculture can be achieved, 
even without complete conversion to organic methods by following GAP. A more reasonable 
and hopeful way forward is a sort of middle ground, where more and more farmers adopt the 
principle of organic farming even if they do not follow the organic standards religiously. In 
this scenario, both the poor farmers and the environment come out way ahead. By periodic 
revision, the GAP standards can be made more and more eco-friendly or even organic as the 
farmers gain more experience and easy access to sufficient quantities of quality organic inputs.  
 
88. Programmes suggested: 
1. 
A comprehensive assessment of the impact of interventions on organic farming on the 
farmer’s welfare, economy, and environment in the state as envisaged under the organic 
farming policy (2010) shall be undertaken to reorient the strategies and to evolve suitable 
action plan for promoting organic farming or GAP in the state. 
2. 
Scheme on ‘Good Agricultural Practices’ (GAP) and ‘Safe to Eat Food Production’ shall be 
implemented in all the districts. The aim shall be to bring the entire area of food crops in 
Kerala under GAP certification during the plan period. 
3. 
The GAP certification programme shall be implemented in all the districts of the state. An on 
line software shall be developed for GAP certification. 
4. 
Parallel to the GAP and ‘safe to eat food production’, Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) 
certification will also be adopted. Initially, as in the 12th plan, the Principal Agricultural 
Officer of the district will function as the ‘Regional Council for Organic Farming’ and the 
Directorate of Agriculture as the ‘Zonal Council’ with the Additional Director of Agriculture 
36 
(CP) as the nodal officer as in the 12th plan. Subsequently, the functions of Regional Council 
and Zonal Council will be entrusted with autonomous bodies. Assistance will be given during 
the first year for organic cultivation and for certification as in the 12th plan. 
5. 
Samples of vegetables, fruits and other food products shall be collected from various outlets 
regularly and tested in the ‘Pesticide Residue and Analytical Library, College Agriculture, 
Vellayanior other approved laboratories for the presence of pesticide residues and results 
published. 
6. 
The participatory guarantee system (PGS) of organic certification started in the twelfth plan, 
with the VFPCK as the implementing agency shall be continued and PGS certification (and 
third party certification, wherever possible,) of other food crops and spices shall also be 
promoted in a phased manner. 
7. 
Awards shall be given for best performing Legislative Constituencies, GramaPanchayats, and 
Municipalities in addition to farmers in organic cultivation and GAP. 
8. 
The state organic farming cell sanctioned in the 12th plan shall continue to function in the 
13th plan also. 
9. 
In all the districts, multi-locational On Farm Testing (OFT) of the ad-hoc organic 
recommendations for pest and disease management of major crops shall be conducted to 
assess the efficacy of recommendations.  Front Line Demonstrations (FLD) shall be 
conducted to popularise organic and GAP methods of pests and disease management, which 
are found to be effective in OFTs. Interventions for OFTs and FLDs shall be included in the 
action plan of KrishiVinjanKendras (KVKs). 
10. Studies shall be conducted for evolving organic methods for the control of pest/diseases for 
which the ad-hoc recommendations are ineffective as revealed through OFTs and for which 
there are no organic recommendations at all.  
11. Until an effective package of organic methods of pest/disease management is evolved, 
farmers who wish to utilize IPM technologies to avoid crop losses, should be permitted to 
adopt the same, including the permitted blue and green chemical insecticides, fungicides, and 
herbicides. 
12. Farmers who resort to only organic methods of pest/disease management and incur crop 
loss/yield reduction should be adequately supported financially. Funds for the same are to be 
made available sufficiently in advance based on prior registration of farmers and assessment 
of crop loss. 
13. Strict measures of quality control are to be insisted for ensuring quality of organic inputs 
supplied to the farmers. 
14. Decentralized approach shall be promoted for the production and distribution of organic 
inputs in the required quality and quantity.  
15. In localities where poor fertility status of soil has adversely affected productivity of crops, 
farmers shall be permitted to resort to Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) practices with 
financial support from development agencies.  
16. Extension programmes to popularize organic farming and GAP will be field oriented rather 
than focusing on lecture sessions handled by experts from Government or NGO sectors. 
Successful experiences of farmers should be scaled up through extension activities.  
17. Support for the management and marketing of organic and GAP products should be 
provided to farmers on a sustained basis. Marketing support through eco-shops can be 
strengthened. Financial support for the farmers during the conversion period, assistance for 
certification and support to facilitate community based organisations (CBO)/Farmer 
produced organisations (FPO) shall be provided to the farmers. 
18. Guidelines (G.O (MS) No.22/2011/Agriculture dated 17.01.2011) (Appendix 4) for regulating 
the distribution and use of pesticides in the state shall be implemented.  
37 
Crop Health Management 
 
89. Incidence of pests and diseases which adversely affects crop production is a major problem 
experienced by farmers. Integrated pest/disease management strategies recognising the fact that crop 
health is an integral part of sustainable agriculture are to be implemented ensuring farmers 
participation. Studies have shown that the field level of adoption of plant protection technologies is 
at a low level only due to various reasons. Hence, effective steps are required to facilitate timely 
diagnosis and adoption of eco-friendly integrated pest management strategies. Available technologies 
for pest/disease management are to be field validated through on farm testing and effective 
technologies are to be demonstrated in farmers' field. Wherever required, efforts are to be made to 
refine the recommended technologies and for evolving appropriate IPM/IDM techniques. Besides, 
group approach is to be promoted on a contiguous area basis for effectively adopting plant 
protection measures involving farmer producer organisations, self -help groups and people's 
representatives. Successful experiences under the recently implemented crop health management 
scheme can be up scaled to benefit more localities where crop damage is reported due to 
pest/disease incidence. Analysis of incidence and intensity of pest/disease incidence and crop loss in 
major crops in the state is also required to formulate and implement appropriate interventions to 
manage the same. The strategies/programme suggested for crop health management includes the 
following: 
1. 
Area wide participatory group approach may be promoted for effectively adopting plant 
protection measures involving farmer producer organisations, self- help groups and people's 
representatives.  
2. 
Successful experiences of adopting participatory approaches for managing rhinoceros beetle, 
root (wilt) disease and bud rot disease of coconut under the schemes implemented by CPCRI 
may be replicated for the management of pests/diseases in other crops/localities from where 
crop loss are being reported 
3. 
Interventions may be implemented for the management of stem bleeding, Thanjavur wilt and 
yellowing disease of coconut in selected localities in collaboration with LSGs, KVKs, ICAR 
institutes and commodity boards like CDB. 
4. 
Assessing the incidence and intensity of pest and disease incidence and crop loss and 
conducting surveillance of major pests, diseases and weeds and forecasting their outbreak 
5. 
Establishing new plant health clinics/referral clinics and strengthening the existing plant 
health clinics for enhancing their efficiency. The plant clinics facility has to be extended to at 
least 100 krishibhavans in each year so as to cover all Krishibhavans of the State in five years. 
6. 
Continuously monitoring pesticide residue in imported fruits, vegetables etc. from 
neighbouring states and taking action to reduce it by intervening at the production level 
through collaborative programmes with the neighbouring states. 
7. 
Continuous monitoring of invasive alien species of weeds and pests. 
8. 
Research is to be initiated for testing newer molecules for the management of major pests and 
diseases of crops and for the use of nanotechnology in pesticide application. 
9. 
KCPM has to be elevated as the Kerala Institute for Plant Health Management (KIPHM).  
 
Soil and Root Health Management 
 
90. Studies have clearly revealed that soil related constraints including soil (surface and sub-surface) 
acidity, deficiency of major, secondary and micronutrients adversely affect the productivity of crops 
in Kerala. Typical laterite soils, the predominant soil type in Kerala state, have low N, medium P, low 
K and Ca, extremely low Mg, medium S, low Boron, Zinc etc. It is a highly weathered tropical soil 
with kaolinite as its clay with low nutrient holding capacity and CEC value. Because of high 
38 
temperature, the mineralization rate is high resulting in low organic matter status. Because of its 
laterite origin, the soil is with low alkaline elemental status and high in acidic elemental status such as 
Fe and Aluminium. In addition, the undulating topography and high rainfall leads to leaching 
resulting in high soil acidity. The highly weathered tropical soil with deficiency and imbalance of 
major, secondary and micronutrients leads to reduced crop health. High soil acidity induced fungal 
diseases is very rampant in the state. Plant disorders resulting from nutrient deficiencies and 
imbalances is quiet common all over the state which are very acute in shallow rooted and fibrous 
rooted crops. In the eastern high hills with steep slopes, there are reports of heavy crop loss in black 
pepper, arecanut and coconut and farmers are abandoning cultivation and are in search of other 
livelihood options. Best management practices for improving soil health suitable for different agro-
ecological units in the state are also lacking. Due to various factors, soil test based nutrient 
management practices are adopted by very few farmers only. Of late, cost of fertilizers is also 
escalating which is a constraint faced by farmers to adopt scientific nutrient management in crops. 
 
91. Under these circumstances strategies to facilitate amelioration of soil related constraints to crop 
production are to be implemented in the state which may include the following: 
1. 
Facilitate soil testing, issuance of soil and root health cards and application of soil ameliorants 
for correcting soil acidity and deficiency of nutrients. Promote use of concentrated organic 
manures, naturally available nutrient resources and chemical fertilizers when there are 
extensive nutrient deficiency symptoms.  
2. 
Facilitate providing different physical, chemical and biological conditions to rhizosphere of 
the crop to have a better root health and its continuous monitoring. Regular monitoring of 
soil pH, cation exchange capacity of soil, amelioration of soils with natural 
resources/chemicals, protection of roots with endophytes, prevention of subsoil hard pan etc. 
to have an ideal physical, chemical and biological niche to root. Need-based use of VAM, 
silica, boron etc. has also to be promoted. 
3. 
Taking into consideration the shift of our society to a largely non-agrarian one, an input 
delivery model aiming to make available external inputs at the door step of the farmers may 
be promoted. 
4. 
Develop best management practices for ameliorating soil related constraints in the major 
crops/cropping systems in different agro-ecological units in the state as being done under the 
ongoing multi-institutional project supported by State Planning Board on 'Enhancing the 
economic viability of Coconut based land use systems for Land Use Planning in Kerala State' 
5. 
The set of best management practices may be scaled up through the ongoing ‘Keragramam’ 
scheme with the active involvement of coconut producer societies in a farmer participatory 
mode. 
6. 
Studies may be taken up to assess the extent and intensity of subsoil acidity and its impact on 
different cropping systems in different agro-ecological units in the state. Similarly, studies to 
analyse the health of roots in relation to soil characteristics are also needed. 
 
Soil Survey and Soil Conservation 
 
92. Co-ordination among different agencies viz., Department of Agriculture, Land Use Board, 
Department of Soil Survey and Soil Conservation should be ensured while planning and 
implementing interventions pertaining to soil survey and soil conservation. The following activities 
may be taken up on priority basis.   
 
Conservation of Natural Resources through Watershed Approach 
 
39 
93. Planning and implementation of natural resource management activities in a watershed perspective is 
essential for the holistic and sustainable development of the area. Integrated Watershed Management 
Plans especially for the ground water vulnerable Blocks in the State have to be developed and 
implemented. 
 
Protection of Catchments of Reservoirs of Water Supply /Irrigation Projects 
 
94. Proposes to conserve the catchments of the reservoirs of Irrigation projects/ Water supply projects 
like Peechi dam in Thrissur, Malampuzha dam in Palakkad &Peruvannamoozhi dam in Kozhikkode 
and other reservoirs on a pilot basis. This will help to check siltation in the reservoirs of 
irrigation/water supply projects and to maintain the capacity of the reservoir by protecting the 
catchment area. 
 
Strengthening the Training Infrastructure 
 
95. The State level institute of the Department, Institute of Watershed Development and Management- 
Kerala (IWDM-K) providing trainings on natural resources management to various stakeholders 
would be strengthened by providing adequate infrastructure and manpower.  
 
Completion of Detailed Soil Survey in the State 
 
96. The Department will complete Detailed Soil Survey in the remaining areas of the state by 2020. 
 
Upgradation of the Soil Museum to International Standards 
 
97. During this Plan period, the Department intends to upgrade the Soil Museum established at 
Thiruvananthapuram to international standards. 
 
Frontier Agricultural Technologies 
 
98. New technologies available for better crop health/soil health management are to be effectively 
utilised for sustainable development of agriculture sector in the state. Few of the relevant 
technologies are listed below. Farmers/farmer producer organisations may be facilitated to adopt the 
technologies by providing incentives. It is also necessary to conduct awareness-cum-training 
programmes on the selected technologies to benefit the farming community. 
 
Use of Efficient Root Endophytes for Better Adaptation and Performance of the Plant Even under Extreme Biotic and 
Abiotic Stress Conditions  
 
99. Easily colonizing root endophytes that can perform as bioregulator, biofertilizer, bioprotector, 
biocontrol and biodegrading (pesticides) agents may be used for both seed and seedling priming. 
Root health of major crops may be improved with the efficient colonization of root endophytes and 
the use of other soil ameliorant. This leads to better root health with high quality root architecture 
and root metabolomics / rootonics which improve the efficient absorption of water and nutrients 
from the soil. Moreover, the root endophytes should be able to degrade residual effect of pesticides 
used especially in vegetable and fruit crops. Addressing the problem of sub-soil acidity must be 
accorded the top priority. 
 
 
 
40 
Use of Crop Friendly Geo-Textiles which Ensure Slow Release of Water and Nutrients to Crop Plants and Finally to 
their Decomposition 
 
100. The geotextiles (coirpith, perlite, peat materials etc.) should be impregnated with nutrient solutions. 
Water and nutrients should be made available to plants in a slow releasing manner to minimize the 
loss of water and nutrients. At their critical stages of the crop growth, the efficient microbes should 
decompose / mineralize the geotextiles / slow releasing nutrient mix in a faster rate.  
 
Use of Quality Agriculture Production Inputs 
 
101. Seeds, seedlings and planting materials should be high yielding, true-to-type and free from pests and 
diseases, primed with efficient root endophytes.  Organic matter and manures used should be devoid 
of all contaminants including mycotoxins, heavy metals, soil borne pathogenic fungi, bacteria, 
nematodes etc. and it should contain minimum level of primary, secondary and micro nutrients and 
also humus. Fertilizers and pesticides especially derived from the natural resources should be used 
for the agricultural production. Sachets or capsule of concentrated nutrients/pesticides should be 
made available to farmers at reasonable price in order to reduce their losses and residual effects.    
 
Use of Quality Irrigation Water 
 
102. Water used for the irrigation water should not contain any toxic materials, heavy metals, effluents, 
phytopathogens etc. and should have optimum level of cat-ions that harness the soil conditions, 
rhizosphere development and easy absorption of water by root hairs. If possible, all the essential 
primary, secondary and micronutrients should be made available to the plant in their critical stages of 
growth through fertigation, micro-irrigation and drip irrigation.  
 
Development of Model Integrated Farming/Cropping Systems  
 
103. Integrate an ideal crop, animal husbandry, fisheries, microbe cafeteria in order to recycle all natural 
inputs available in the farming area.    
 
Processing and Handling of Harvested Produce to Minimize the Post- Harvest Loss and To Market Safe-To-Eat Food  
 
104. The crops should be harvested, processed and stored hygienically in order to reduce the loss of 
harvested produce (Irradiation energy / Radio-frequency energy / Solar energy technology).  
 
Value Addition of Harvested Produce 
 
105. The technology incubation centres may be equipped to initiate start-up centres on different chain of 
value added and processed food produces.  
 
Precision Agriculture  
 
106. Precision agriculture techniques may be commercialized in special agricultural zones.  
 
Vertical Farming  
 
107. Vertical farming in high value vegetables and fruits may be explored.    
 
41 
Harnessing the Natural Resource Conservation Technologies at Production Level 
 
108. For water harvesting, micro-irrigation, drip irrigation, fertigation, recycling of agricultural inputs, 
laser land levelling and zero/reduced tillage in undulated topography.   
 
Use of Nanotechnology in Different Agricultural Inputs Use Especially in Manures/Fertilizers/Pesticides  
 
109. Nanotechnology can be used to increase their efficiency for crop production and protection with 
very low level of environmental risk.  
 
Integrated Land Use Planning, Use of Remote Sensing and Micro-Processor Based Decision Support Systems 
 
110. These methods can be used in crops grown in 'special agricultural zones' for better crop production 
and protection.  
 
Quality planting material 
 
111. Making available good quality planting material is an essential pre-requisite for higher productivity of 
crops. Various farms under the State Department of Agriculture, agencies like VFPCK and Kerala 
Agricultural University are the major sources of supply of quality planting material in the public 
sector, apart from the farms of commodity boards and ICAR institutes functioning in the state.  
Farmer Producer organisations like Coconut Producer Federations (CPFs) also produce and market 
seedlings of crops like coconut. There is huge gap between the availability and requirement of seeds 
and planting materials in our state (Table5). 
 
Table 5 Availability and requirement of planting materials in Kerala 
 
112. Since, the production from various agencies is unable to meet the demand private sector players also 
has a significant role in supplying planting materials. Regulatory measures to ensure quality of the 
planting materials supplied by private sector agencies are quite inadequate and some unscrupulous 
elements exploit the situation causing loss to the growers and adversely affecting the sustainable 
farming.  
 
113. The strategies suggested for improving the planting material supply situation include: 
1. 
Strengthening quality control mechanisms. 
2. 
State/District perspective plans may be prepared for planting material production and 
marketing involving/linking various agencies.

Functioning of farms under State Department of Agriculture may be improved through 
purchase of newly evolved nucleus planting materials, increasing the area under progeny 
orchards, development of tissue culture facilities, establishment of processing units, 
establishment of on-farm production units of bio fertilizer and bio pesticides, establishing 
integrated farming systems and strengthening seed production programme, improving 
infrastructure facilities of the farms/nurseries for enhancing quantity and quality of planting 
materials etc. 
4. 
Establishing high density progeny gardens with updated/latest high yielding and promising 
varieties in every farm of the department of Agriculture and the KAU institutions including 
KrishiVigyanKendras.  
5. 
Capacity building to impart plant propagations skills and technology – local self- help groups 
and Kudumbasree units, local youth etc. can be imparted propagation skills and later engaged 
in the activities on profit sharing. Production and popularisation of grafted vegetable seedlings 
have to be given a boost. 
6. 
Seed multiplication and popularization of new varieties of vegetables released by KAU. 
7. 
Creating facilities for transgenic seed identification at High-tech seed testing lab attached to 
Department of Olericulture, College of Horticulture, Vellanikkara 
8. 
Strengthening tissue culture labs and biocontrol labs under DoA and KAU involving SHGs/ 
participatory mode. 
9. 
Establishment of a state level seed certification agency as envisaged in Seed Act. 
 
Agro Service Centre and Service Delivery 
 
114. Low level of mechanisation and lack of skilled labour adversely affect crop production in the state.  
Hence, it is necessary to strengthen the  existing Agro service centres (ASC) established at block 
level and Farmer Service Centres to facilitate integration of services like mechanisation, labour 
support, biopharmacy and planting materials, soil testing support and other technology based 
services  and to establish new agro service centres for improved service delivery to farmers. 
Interventions to be implemented during 13th plan period through Department of Agriculture may 
include establishing  new Agro Service centres, formation of apex body for effective functioning of 
Agro Service centres, provide usage subsidy for machineries to model ASCs, maintenance of custom 
hiring centres, establishment of one Agro machinery Service Centresin all districts, skill development 
of members of Agro Service centre and karshika karma Sena on machinery, production of bio inputs 
etc., and software development for rationalisation of use of equipment of Agro Service 
Centre/Karshika Karma Sena. 
 
Delineating Special Agriculture Zones under the Overall Frame Work of Agro Ecological Units 
 
115. Realising wide agro Climatic variability of Kerala, the National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use 
Planning (ICAR), Regional Centre, Nagpur was entrusted with the delineation of the State into 
different Agro Ecological Units (AEU).  Accordingly after extensive field visit, review of studies, 
analysis of database and after analysing soil, climate and topography, theState has been spatially 
delineated into 23 AEUs. Taking the AEZ delineation as base work, a number of AEZ projects were 
completed covering different sectors. The yield gap of various crops on Agro ecological unit wise 
were also worked out.  
 
116. It is expected that dividing targets and resource allocation on Agro Ecological Approach, identifying 
the potentials at the local and regional level, constraints   and possibilities of each AEU would result 
in realization of higher outputs in a time- bound manner. In order to further streamline 
43 
implementation of projects, 23 AEUs were further regrouped into 20 AEUs taking blocks as the 
basic unit. In order to implement area based or crop based interventions, the concept of Special 
Agriculture Zones under the overall frame work of AEU also could be considered.  
 
117. Special Agricultural Development Zones (SAZ) are to be delineated for formulating and 
implementing convergence based result oriented schemes in selected crops on an autonomous and 
project based approach. Single window system for providing all incentives and for all needs through 
special offices as in the case of Special Economic Zones. 1-5 blocks in contiguous areas based on 
minimum area under the selected crop, potential for production, soil and climatic conditions etc 
have to be used to develop criteria for the selection of zones in each district. The facilities suggested 
to create in the SAZs include Agro Service Centres including soil testing labs and call centre, plant 
health clinics, weather stations and advisories, bio-pharmacy including on farm production units, 
planting materials production units, farmers markets supported by LSGIs, processing and value 
addition units, irrigation support, need based interest free loan, extension support including ICT 
based initiatives, community radio, procurement system for surplus production, promotion of 
Farmer Technology Development and  training to farmers. During the 13thplan SAZs may be 
initiated for rice, vegetables, banana, coconut, mango, pineapple, jack, tribal agriculture, medicinal 
plants, floriculture and for sesamum in selected districts/blocks/localities. 
 
Agriculture Marketing 
 
118. As part of strengthening marketing infrastructure for agricultural produce and to ensure reasonable 
price for the growers weekly markets may be established at Grama Panchayat level.  Besides, a chain 
of agro super bazars and eco shops can also be facilitated. Creating an E-portal and linking farmer 
collectives with states following GAP can also be taken up. Efforts may be made for the required 
software development networking for the effective management of the portal. 
 
Post-Harvest Management and Value Addition 
 
119. Value addition through product diversification is an important strategy for enhancing income from 
farming which is highly relevant in the present day context of price fluctuation/price crash in most 
of the crops cultivated in the state. However, the level of post- harvest processing and value addition 
is quite low at present which necessitates meaningful interventions to support our farming 
community to utilise the vast potential for value addition in different crops. Hence, support may be 
provided to value addition projects in coconut and other crops through establishment of Agro Parks. 
It is also necessary that capacity development programmes on various aspects of technologies and 
entrepreneurship development related to production and marketing of value added products are 
conducted to benefit farmer producer organisations. Technology Incubation Centres and Business 
Incubation Centres by reputed Institutions have to be fostered. Support also may be provided for 
the Honey Mission, Pineapple Mission and SFAC. 
 
Biodiversity and Local Germplasm Conservation and Promotion 
 
120. Design of sustainable farming systems and appropriate technologies aimed at enhancing food 
production for self-sufficiency should incorporate locally adapted, native crops. Hence, conservation 
and utilisation of biodiversity and indigenous germplasm assume much significance. Initiatives to 
conserve the traditional and indigenous varieties available in different crops especially in tribal 
habitats may be implemented ensuring active participation of local farming community. The local 
farming community should be adequately supported for maintaining their crop heritage and 
44 
persevere in conducting the crop management practices for nurturing these plants. Assistance may 
be provided for cultivation and multiplication of local germplasm by tribal, local farmer clusters, 
NGOs and other organizations.  
 
Promotion of Agriculture in Tribal Hamlets 
 
121. Efforts for biodiversity and local germplasm conservation and promotion may also be linked with 
specific interventions to promote crop production activities in tribal lands so as to ensure food and 
nutritional security to the tribal population. 
 
Establishment of Integrated Farming Models 
 
122. In Kerala, marginal farmers accounted for 96.3% of the total number of land holdings. It is a 
challenge to make farming remunerative in these fragmented holdings. Cultivation of a single crop in 
these holdings does not generate sufficient income to meet the family requirement. Moreover, 
presently farmers in Kerala are more exposed to economic risks and uncertainties owing to the rapid 
price fluctuations/price crash in most of the cultivated crops. In these circumstances it is needless to 
emphasize the importance of integrated farming which comprise of components from agriculture, 
animal husbandry, poultry and fisheries coexisting in a mutually complementary and self -sustainable 
manner yielding diversity and quality in production and maximum land use efficiency. The 
agronomic feasibility and economic viability of adoption of integrated farming systems have been 
amply demonstrated in research stations and farmers’ fields. In spite of the obvious benefits of 
integrated farming system over the traditional monoculture, the extent of adoption of the integrated 
systems is not at a satisfactory level. Hence, interventions may be formulated and implemented to 
popularise integrated farming system models suitable to different agro-ecological units in the state. 
 
Risk Management 
 
123. Crop Insurance, compensating crop loss due to natural calamities, human-animal conflict 
1. For restructuring of existing crop insurance scheme with nominal increase in premium and major 
increase in the rate of compensation for crop loss under consideration of Government of Kerala. 
2. For meeting the crop loss compensation claim of natural calamity affected farmers 
3. Over and above the SDRF norms of assistance. 
4. Other existing components to continue 
5. Hi-tech Agriculture :Restructuring and strengthening 
6. Apart from the ongoing components, construction of mini polyhouses in condominiums and 
small households are also to be proposed. 
7. Construction of Mini polyhouses for flowers and vegetable cultivation in condominiums and in 
small households 
8. Improved technical marketing support 
9. Establishment of Micro Irrigation units – Drip and sprinkler irrigation under PMKSY  
10. In situ water conservation methods (in situ moisture trench, husk burial/mulching ), water 
harvesting structures like ponds, community water harvesting structures with command area of 
10 ha, irrigation units like pump sets and solar pump sets 
11. Water and waste recycling  in condominiums /house holds 
 
Urban Agriculture 
 
45 
124. Urban agriculture is evolving in the state. A comprehensive project covering technical, input and 
service delivery could be implemented in the 13thFive-Year Plan in corporations and municipalities. 
 
Lease land farming 
 
125. In Kerala, there are people who are interested in farming (young farmers/agricultural 
labourers/SHGs/JLGs) but they do not own land. At the same time people who are not interested 
in farming or those who are too busy to be in farming own land. So, concealed tenancy is widely 
prevalent. The system, as of now, has several inherent constraints including threat to land ownership, 
degradation of the land due to exploitative farming etc. 
 
126. The social situation in the state demands promotion of lease land farming by strengthening the 
regulatory measures in support of the land owners as well as the cultivators through a licensing 
mechanism. There should be advisory/monitoring/supervisory mechanism at Grama Panchayat 
level for prescribing rent rates/licensing conditions/management practices and dispute resolution. 
The sustainability of the production practices also needs to be ensured. The system may also 
facilitate the utilization of public lands by such measures. 
 
Agricultural Water Management 
 
127. One of the major impacts of Climate change in Asian Subcontinent is projected as water scarcity. 
The demographic forces, rapid urbanization and industrialization cause serious pressures on water 
resources. The percapita availability of water is showing a declining trend over the years and is 
projected to be further low, as per the estimates for 2050.The conflicting interests of major water 
users, i.e., agriculture, industries and domestic sector may lead to a situation of growing water 
markets and rising prices. Naturally this situation can lead to serious health issues, social frictions 
and economic burden to the households and resource poor farmers may be at the risk of leaving 
farming. To face these challenges, the proposed interventions are: 
1. 
There should be a relook on the existing subsidy policies (especially energy subsidy) in 
agriculture. 
2. 
The existing privately owned open wells/bore wells and other water bodies are to be 
registered. 
3. 
There should be a programme for natural resource accounting by the local self governments 
and a register of the natural assets and its status to be maintained by the officials (like stock 
register in offices) and its accountability to be specified. 
4. 
The licensing for bore well digging is to be enforced. 
 
Unique Selling Products 
 
128. Kerala has the diverse ecosystems and products which are known for its uniqueness. These products 
are to be specifically addressed for its promotion through scientific management. For instance, the 
mangoes of Muthalamada panchayat have very high market potential in the national and 
international markets as it is the first harvest across the country. Presently, the management of the 
mango orchards is mainly by the lessee traders who have only short term profit motive and the 
pesticide /chemical use is reported to be very high .The existing trade practices are also against the 
interest of producers and the full commercial potential is not realized. There should be a special 
package for the scientific management and product promotion/market promotion and value 
addition of mangoes of Muthalamada. The project should include, research, extension and 
development aspects that should aim at the overall development of the area. The participation of 
46 
local self governments and the stake holders in mango farming and trade may also be ensured. 
Similar approach has to be adopted in the case of other unique selling products of the State also. 
 
Farm Income Guarantee Scheme 
 
129. The budget speech of 2016, Government of India introduced the target of doubling of farm income 
by 2022, which later on was observed by many scientists and policy analysts as unattainable. It was 
estimated that the sector should register a 12% growth annually (in nominal terms and 20-30 % in 
real terms) to achieve this target, while the realised rate was marginal only. In Kerala, 30 percent is 
the farm families’ income from cultivation. Though share of wages shows a high 44 %, the 
proportion shows a decline over the period, indicating a shift towards cultivation, non- farm sector 
and livestock. This trend signals the importance of improving agricultural income to ensure a higher 
inclusive growth. Moreover, the consumption expenditure of farm households in the State is the 
highest making the households to depend on credit, institutional and non- institutional. Thus the 
indebtedness is also on the higher side. The inability to continue in farming prompts most of the 
practising farmers leave the profession. In this background, a pilot programme to work out the 
modalities of the Agricultural Income Guarantee Scheme has to be envisaged with the following 
broad objectives, 
1. 
To   avoid the situation of practising farmers leaving the profession 
2. 
To attract young farmers/new farmers to the profession 
3. 
To improve the social status of farmers 
4. 
To  sustain and improve the food production and ensure food safety and security 
5. 
To maintain ecological balance and ecosystem health 
 
130. The scheme will be successful only if the payments are made on time. For this each ADA can 
estimate the potential level of compensation required based on previous data in their records and 
make a demand. The State may constitute a separate fund and advance the amount to the respective 
ADAs, well ahead of the event. The pilot program should help in scientifically delineating the 
feasible measures to assure a stabilized income from crop enterprises in the event of price fall or 
crop failure and thus assist the farmers in overcoming potential risks of income loss from 
agriculture. 
 
Agricultural Extension, Capacity Development and Convergence 
 
Revitalisation of KrishiBhavans 
 
131. The network of Krishibhavans across the state continues to be the most important agency providing 
farm advisory services. However, the major share of office time in Krishibhavans is dedicated to 
routine office work, reporting, and meetings and hence the quality of implementation of 
developmental schemes especially which needs field level interactions; and extension activities gets 
affected. The staff support to Krishibhavans has to be reorganized based on work load and number 
of farm families in the jurisdiction. 
 
132. For improving the efficiency of the functioning of krishibhavans and for easy monitoring, a 
centralised MIS-FMS system (paperless automation of the activities) is an alternative. Even, 
videoconferencing tools like webex can also be utilized in review systems than regular face-to-face 
meetings along with other web and mobile based ICT tools. Institutionalizing the already existing 
models of ICT applications can also be attempted (Strengthening the network with high-end 
computers and high bandwidth connections to Krishibhavans is the precondition). 
47 
 
133. ICT initiatives by various agencies and institutions are available in plenty, spread over many 
platforms, viz. Information Systems (IS) and DSS on various activities in different stages of 
production; input availability; market intelligence; and forewarnings. Hence, integration of various 
agencies under one roof for providing vital information on various components of agriculture so 
that it will act as a one stop solution for the needs of the farmers. In addition, authenticity of 
information can be ensured, especially in social media, as in case of discussion forums, WhatsApp 
groups, Face Book forums, YouTube videos by establishing authorised platforms and groups for the 
users.  
 
134. We depend on sample survey data as the source of production statistics wherein micro level data is 
not available. Since, a grass root level institutional reach through krishibhavans is well established, 
collection of basic data as a one-time initiative and then upgradation at regular interval is very much 
possible especially in this era of IT revolution. Thus, a systematic and centralized data repository on 
agricultural production, cost of cultivation, pest and disease status, etc. can be prepared. Similarly, 
information on production of agricultural produces and value added products can also be part of the 
information collected which can be linked to the data repository on market information for 
strengthening demand-supply balance. 
 
135. GIS based thematic maps on soil fertility, pest and disease incidence, other natural resources and 
cropping pattern with holdings as the basic unit could be prepared. This would eventually help us in 
decentralized planning on crop husbandry. Location specific optimum cropping pattern can be 
formulated, even at variety level.  
 
136. Soil health cards are issued with two years validity wherein systematic upgradation is so crucial. In 
this case, development of centralized database on individual holdings on soil health status accessible 
online will be an efficient alternative. 
 
137. The fact that even though there are many ICT initiatives, their usage is limited, showing the 
importance of capacity building of extension personnel and farmers on using the apps and also 
developing easy-to-use applications. Medium of communication should be local language and voice 
or video based communication in place of text is preferred. Mobile applications are to be given 
priority than web based as mobile phones are more common nowadays. 
 
138. The Department of Agriculture has to be gradually transformed as a department with specialist 
support in soil and crop health at Block and District levels as in the state’s Directorate of Health 
services. The agricultural officers should be relieved from the over burdening activities such as 
report writing, attending frequent meetings and trainings at different levels and should be facilitated 
for regular field visits and farmer contact. The KrishiBhavan should be made a paper-less office with 
ISO certification. The Block –level offices of the Department of Agriculture should also be 
strengthened. 
 
139. The functional linkages at various levels between the Department of Agriculture and other technical 
departments should be strengthened, especially for implementing interventions on natural resource 
management through watershed based approach contemplated in the HKM. The convergence 
mechanisms envisaged in the ATMA scheme have to be revitalized and fostered. At present the 
extension component is very weak in majority of development schemes implemented through 
krishibhavans (including centrally sponsored, state sponsored and LSG schemes). Financial target 
and achievement is given the priority with least concern for the extension efforts for effectively 
48 
implementing the interventions in farmers’ field. Hence, it should be made mandatory for including 
the component for extension interventions also for implementing the schemes at krishibhavan level. 
The involvement of krishibhavan staff in the implementation of ATMA programmes is not at a 
satisfactory level now. To enhance the level of their participation and to ensure convergence, the 
formulation and implementation of ATMA programmes will have to take into account the type of 
agricultural schemes to be implemented in the respective areas. 
 
140. A ‘knowledge centre’ at the district level has to be developed as a district resource centre for 
effective farm advisory services. Maintenance of the centre will be through ATMA. 
 
141. The auditing system followed in the department needs to be thoroughly restructured for improving 
the Departmental Quality Management System. Social Audit becomes inevitable in the current 
context of transparency in public governance.  
 
142. Strengthening of Agriculture Engineering wing for enabling small farm mechanization in the state is 
to be urgently attempted. 
 
143. The norms for implementation of schemes and projects under LSGD and DOA must be reviewed 
and unified. 
 
Capacity Development 
 
144. In a dynamic science as agriculture, human capacity development is inevitable. Capacity development 
should encompass aspects of awareness raising, education and training, attitude change, confidence 
building, participation in decision making and action. The 3500- strong human resources of the 
Department of Agriculture have to be developed continuously to provide topical and timely 
technology and service delivery support to the farming community, particularly to the farm women 
and other weaker and marginalized sections. This will also help in professionalizing the department 
of agriculture with soil and crop health specialists at Block and District levels. A capacity 
development policy has to be formulated and implemented for this. 
 
145. International and National level institutions must be identified and networked for providing capacity 
development assistance for the technical staff of the department through exchange visits, 
internships, advanced trainings, online courses like MOOC etc. 
 
146. A perspective Capacity Development programme for each technical staff in the DOA has to be 
chalked out, provided, monitored and evaluated.  A matrix depicting the skill sets and the 
institutional and temporal aspects for each of the personnel in the DOA has to be worked out and 
executed with impact. 
 
147. The ‘Management Development Program’ type trainings to the officers at SAMETI will be ideal. 
 
148. Technical Trainings should be located in Research Institutions like KAU, KVASU, KVFOS, ICAR 
institutions and other national technical training institutions 
 
149. Smart class rooms including Skype/VOIP facilities have to be developed in all the training 
institutions in agriculture in the state. An exclusive project for the Infrastructure development can be 
thought of for funding from the Kerala Infrastructure Development Fund Board (KIDFB). Cost-
49 
sharing trainings, sponsored programmes, consultancies, impact studies etc can be taken up for 
revenue generation and long-term financial viability 
 
150. The farmers training programs which are demand-driven, need- based and location specific have to 
be conducted by the RATTCS, FTCs, ATMA Training centres at District and Block levels, KVKs, 
established NGOs etc. Particular emphasis has to be placed on the capacity development of farm 
women. SAMETI will be the nodal agency for serving as the planning, monitoring and hand holding 
institution for CD in agriculture and allied sectors at the state level. Training calendars for all these 
networked institutions of SAMETI will have to be prepared and publicised in advance for ensuring 
committed participation. 
 
151. Capacity development in frontier areas including IT/BT/NT/agribusiness including value addition, 
urban and peri-urban agriculture, sun rise fields, HKM etc should also be the focus in these 
programs besides technical and managerial aspects. Bench marking of Best Practices should be 
attempted to continuously improve Training Quality Management. 
 
152. Induction and motivation trainings for all newly recruited staff should be given within their 
probation period warranting successful completion of the training. 
 
153. IIFS, IT including social media networking and Social Capital Development must be the thrust areas 
in the trainings for the farmers and officers 
 
154. The collaborative post-graduate diploma programmes and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) 
on PHM, AEM, IT/Social media have to be further strengthened as Continuing Agriculture 
Education (CAE) programs in line with CME in the Health Services.  
 
155. SAMETI should be developed into a National Centre of Excellence in Capacity Development in 
Tropical Agricultural Management. 
 
156. SAMETI should be elevated as a Deemed University for Extension and Management sciences in 
agriculture offering post-graduate degree, certificate, and diploma courses. 
 
Strategies for effectively utilising national research institutes for agricultural development of Kerala state 
 
157. Various national research organisations are functioning in the state having mandate over major crops 
cultivated in the state and other sectors like fisheries. They include ICAR institutes like CPCRI, IISR, 
CTCRI, CIFT, CMFRI, and ICRI under Spices Board, RRII under Rubber Board etc. 
 
158. Unprecedented crisis situation is prevailing in majority of the crops covered by these national 
research institutes wherein farming community is struggling due to price crash in the market and 
other constraints.  
 
159. In this era of liberalised trade, apart from pro-farmer government policies to protect the interests of 
farmers, the other major thrust should be to enhance the efficiency in the respective sectors by 
enhancing productivity and reducing cost of cultivation.  For bringing this efficiency in different 
crops/sectors, effective utilisation of technologies generated by the above research organisations can 
play a crucial role. 
 
50 
160. Even though frontline technology transfer initiatives are being conducted by these research 
institutions, their efficacy and coverage is not at a satisfactory level. Many studies indicate very low 
level of field level utilisation of these technologies. Hence, efforts are required to make use of the 
research output of these institutions to address the technology gap/to address the problems 
experienced in farmers' field in the state. 
 
161. Functional linkages among the national research institutions and state agriculture university and state 
department of agriculture, commodity boards and other development and extension organisations 
are rather weak. 
 
162. An effective platform is to be built to bring together the national research institutions and research 
institutions under the state government like KAU, KVASU, KUFOS to evolve effective and 
uniform technology recommendations in the respective crops/sectors. A uniform package of 
practices recommendations for crops suitable to the agro-ecological characteristics of the state is to 
be evolved integrating the research outputs from national institutes with the state Agriculture 
University and other research institutions under the state government. 
 
163. A mechanism is to be put in place to ensure that the research projects implemented by the national 
research institutes functioning in the state address the field problems experienced by the farmers in 
the respective crops. For this research-extension-farmer interface programs at regular intervals (at 
least once a year) should be made mandatory as part of the annual research council meetings of the 
national institutes in which responsible officials from the state agriculture department and other line 
departments and representatives of farmer producer organisations and commodity boards should 
participate. 
 
164. Though the KVKs are functioning in all the districts with the responsibility of technology 
assessment and refinement and conducting frontline demonstration and extension activities, many a 
times research output relevant for addressing the field problems are not tested/ validated and the 
feedback for refinement is rarely made available. Hence it is also necessary to bring the KVK system 
as an important partner in the proposed interface.  
 
165. A state level official body involving higher level officials of the national research institutes, state 
agriculture universities, commodity boards, state agriculture department and other line departments 
should be constituted for effectively monitoring the interface programmes.  
 
166. Arrangements are to be made for the participation of scientists from national research institutes in 
the Monthly Technology Advisory meetings of ATMA and Multi- disciplinary diagnostic teams, 
especially in those districts where field problems pertaining to the mandate crops of national 
research institutes are reported. Participation of scientists from national research institutes in the 
follow up activities including diagnostic field visits and formulation and implementation of on farm 
testing of recommended technologies followed by front line demonstration should also be ensured. 
Linkage between the ATMA set up and national research institutes has to be strengthened. In some 
districts.  
 
167. Linking national research institutes with the implementation of decentralised planning process of 
LSGs through the effective utilisation of relevant technologies from these institutes is also to be 
given due consideration. In the capacity development programmes being organised by KILA, 
sessions on activities/achievements of national research institutes should be included to create 
awareness among peoples’ representatives from LSGs on the potential   of making use of available 
51 
technologies from these research institutes for effective implementation of decentralised schemes for 
agricultural development. 
 
168. Functional linkages can be made more effective through promoting participatory research/extension 
approach as experienced under the NATP project on TAR-IVLP. 
 
Proposed Outlay for Agriculture in 13thFive Year Plan 
 
169. The expenditure incurred for Agriculture covering  Crop Husbandry, Soil & Water Conservation, 
Food, storage and Warehousing, Investment in Agricultural Financial Institutions, Agricultural 
Marketing and Quality Control & Other Programmes implemented by the department of 
Agriculture, Land Use Board and Soil and Water conservation during Tenth, Eleventh and Twelfth 
Five year plan periods are shown in Table.6. The expenditure for agriculture sector in total state plan 
out lay is only about 3 percent for the last three Five-Year Plan periods. Significant increase in 
resource allocation in agriculture sector is required during 13th Five year plan to improve growth 
rate as well as productivity of crops. The outlay covering crop husbandry, soil and water 
conservation, marketing and other programmes implemented by the department of Agriculture and 
Soil and water conservation has to be enhanced to a minimum of 5 percent of State plan outlay 
during 13thFive-Year Plan.   The outlay for allied sectors to be provided over and above this share 
with significant increase in the plan period considering the priorities and the share earmarked in 
previous plan periods.
