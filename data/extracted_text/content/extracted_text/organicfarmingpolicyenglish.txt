Kerala State Organic Farming Policy, Strategy and Action Plan 
 
Vision 
Make Keralaâ€™s farming sustainable, rewarding, and competitive, ensuring poison-free 
water, soil and food to every citizen.  
Background  
India has a glorious history of farming, starting probably from the 6th millennium BC 
in the Indus Valley, harnessing the annual floods and the subsequent alluvial deposits. The 
Indus Valley Civilization was founded on sustainable farming practices. Subsequently, 
our culture and ethos became reflections of the agricultural practices and it became 
mutually inseparable till recently. Harvest of the main crops is celebrated through out the 
country. 
In Kerala, it went to the extent of identifying the farmland with Mother God or a 
female. Just like the female has to take rest after delivery, the farm land has also to be 
given rest for three months after the harvest; tilling is strictly prohibited during this 
period. Although it may look superstitious, the ecological reason behind this ritual is that 
tilling during monsoon leads to severe soil erosion and thus, is an unsustainable practice. 
Therefore, sustainability has been the hallmark of our farming system from time 
immemorial; growing the time tested, weather suited, traditional crops with or without 
additional organic inputs, but deeply interwoven with the ecological systems and climatic 
conditions. 
The once flourished Pokkali cultivation in the coastal districts and the Kaipad farming 
system in Kannur district are testimonials to manâ€™s ingenuity in harnessing the 
natural events for farming, that too integrated farming, without affecting the natural 
ecological processes and without even any external inputs. 
However, the so called modern agriculture-unmindful of the ecosystem principles so 
revered and practiced for centuries-led to seemingly irrevocable ecological and 
environmental catastrophes in the country. The Green Revolution essentially replaced the 
traditional varieties with high-yielding ones. These high yielding varieties now recognized 
as â€˜high input varietiesâ€™ needed tonnes of fertilizers, to achieve the target growth. The crops 
and varieties alien to the soil attracted new pests and diseases and also outbreaks of existing 
pests. To combat them, came in huge quantities of pesticides. Input of these "exotic" 
elements into the traditional farming led to multitude of environmental issues.  
The microorganisms declined; the soil lost its fertility and vitality; water demand 
increased and, the time tested traditional varieties disappeared. In short, the century old 
practices came to a halt. The eternal relationship between the farmer and farm land was 
lost. More importantly, sustainability of the agriculture systems collapsed, cost of 
cultivation soared, income of farmers stagnated and, food security and food safety became 
a daunting challenge.  
 
2
Biodiversity in the agricultural fields has now become a history of the past. The 
farmland became silent; devoid of the croak of frogs, chattering of warblers, whistling of 
Whistling Ducks. The long tubular straw striven nests of the Baya weaver bird hanging on 
the fronds of palm-a once spectacular sight-have disappeared from most localities. The 
insectivorous birds such as drongo, bee-eater, even the house sparrow became rare or 
locally extinct, indicating the collapse of the entire food webs of the farm land.  
In the forestry sector, fortunately the use of pesticides has been much less. However, 
the aerial spraying of pesticides in India was first tried in Kerala in 1965 to control the teak 
defoliators in Konni forest division. It was noted that with in 48 hours nearly 162 non-
target species of arthropods were knocked down.  
The mentally and physically retarded and handicapped children in Padri village in 
Kasergod tell the world in unequivocal terms the tragedies and disasters that aerial spraying 
of pesticides could inflict on human life.   
As a result of all these "modern" techniques, the air, water and the soil were polluted; 
most food grains and farm products were contaminated by pesticides. The run off from the 
farm land contaminated the wetlands - rivers, tanks, ponds, reservoirs, lakes and all water 
bodies-and the life in them. Fishes carried high levels of pesticides and also heavy metals, 
the latter as a result of the many chemical industries that sprang up to provide chemical 
fertilizers.  
Health hazards became unimaginably high. Incidence of fatal diseases rose. Hospitals 
with modern amenities came up in the cities as profit making industries. Pharmaceuticals 
flourished.  
Food crops became non-attractive, while cash crops became more remunerative. Rice 
fields have been filled up for non-agricultural activities. The area under cash crops 
expanded during the last 20 years (16% under rubber alone), while that under food crops 
plummeted (to just 9% of the total cultivated area).  The monoculture of such economically 
valuable crops led to soil erosion and loss of soil fertility to a great extent. The advent of 
chemical intensive farming and its prevalence in Kerala for the past 50 years have resulted 
in the near stagnant levels of productivity of many of these economically important crops 
such as coconut, cashew, pepper, coffee, tea, cardamom and arecanut. Besides these, many 
regions in Kerala, like Wayanad started facing acute water scarcity. The State has taken 
note of it and given priority in the Eleventh Five Year Plan.  
Over and above, the economic liberalization and WTO policies added to the woes of 
the farmers by bringing down the prices of agriculture commodities. They are caught in the 
debt trap owing to the loan taken to meet the high cost of farming, as it demanded more 
external inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides and water. These led to increasing instances of 
suicide by farmers.  Investment in agriculture has essentially changed from the farmer to 
the industries supplying input to the farmer, and as a direct consequence, net income for 
farmers decreased while the industries supporting agriculture in the country flourished.  
The national policies of opening retail sector to national and multinational companies 
pose great threat to our food sovereignty and right to safe food. The enhanced â€˜food milesâ€™ 
 
3
led to increased carbon emission, further increasing the load of green house gases. The 
potent danger of introducing Genetically Modified crops, monopoly of seeds by national 
and multinational corporate bodies could very well be the last straw on the camelâ€™s back for 
the farmers of Kerala.  
Many farmers have realized   that they are fighting a loosing battle with the "high yield 
variety - fertilizer-pesticide pack" of Green Revolution. They have also realized that the 
degradation and disruption of the fragile ecosystems of the â€˜Godâ€™s own countryâ€™ are the 
chief culprits for the water scarcity, nutritional insecurity, loss of primary productivity and 
agrarian crisis being faced by the State.  
The farmers in Kerala are convinced that the only way is to return to the traditional 
sustainable ways of cultivation without harming the ecosystem. Thus the organic farming, a 
system with the broad principle of â€˜live and let liveâ€™, came up which was recognized 
nationally and internationally.  
Organic agriculture is not limited to crop production alone, but encompasses animal 
husbandry, dairy, fisheries, poultry, piggery, forestry, bee keeping, and also uncultivated 
biodiversity around. 
By and large, there is an increasing awareness among the consumers also on the 
deleterious effects of pesticides and hence, there has been a high demand for organically 
cultivated food produces. Therefore it has become a solemn responsibility of the 
Government to encourage organic farming to ensure poison-free food at affordable price to 
every citizen.  
There have been demurs and doubts on the practicability of organic farming on the 
ground that the production would plummet and the country would once again be forced to 
yet another food crisis. This is quite unfounded. Success stories on high productivity of 
organic farming are now abundant. The Food and Agriculture Organization reports at the 
International Conference on Organic Agriculture and Food Security 2007 as follows: 
"Conversion of global agriculture to organic management, without converting wild lands 
to agriculture and using -fertilizers, would result in a global agricultural supply of 2640 
to 4380 kcal/person/day. Sustainable intensification in developing countries through 
organic practices would increase production by 56 per cent. Organic yields on average are 
comparable to conventional yields; although yields do decline initially when converting 
from high-input systems and almost double when converting from low-input systems". It 
also has found that organic farms use 33 to 56 per cent less energy per ha than conventional 
farms.   
Worldwide, as of now, more than 22.81 million hectares of land area is managed 
organically and the market of organic food is around $30 billion. It may be noted that 
Cuba, a country with 42,402 sq. miles of land and with 11.3 million people, is completely 
organic.

A brief history of organic farming  
Pesticides have been in use in agriculture since Second World War and from the very 
beginning there have been concerns about the commercialization of chemical pesticides. 
Rachel Carsonâ€™s, "Silent Spring" published in 1964 brought out the scientific certainties of 
the impacts of pesticides on environment. Although DDT was banned in the developed 
world in the 1970â€™s, and its use in the agriculture fields of developing countries later, 
varieties of toxic pesticides found their way into the farms .The scientific predictions of 
Rachel Carson became true and the public, especially farmers and  scientists, the world 
over  realised the dangers of  pesticides. This led to the beginning of non-chemical farming. 
Researches and trials of traditional methods and also new models of soil and crop 
management began to appear. 
For the last 4-5 decades scientists have been trying to find out a sustainable agricultural 
system.  One of the prominent personalities among them was Sir. Albert Howard, the 
Advisor for Agriculture in India from 1905 to 1924.  "An Agricultural Testament", written 
by him, is considered to be the first authentic book on organic farming in India.  "Indoor 
method" in organic composting was also worked out first by him. 
The permaculture (permanent agriculture) experiments of Bill Mollison and Holmen in 
the 1970â€™s gave hope to many farmers the world over. The permaculture wave had its 
impact in Kerala too and since then many farmers have started experimenting this 
methodology and they found that this is one of the best practices for Kerala with its 
topographical peculiarities and high rainfall so as to conserve soil and water and improve 
productivity of their farms. 
In a report submitted in 1983 to the Department of Agriculture of the United States, 
Robert Papendick and James Parr, agriculture scientists of the same department, had 
emphasised the crucial need for focussing research on sustainable agriculture to replace the 
farming systems being followed using chemical pesticides and fertilizers.  
The infamous Bhopal tragedy of 1984 was an eye opener to a larger section of people 
in India and abroad. Discussion on alternatives began seriously. Publication of the book 
"One Straw Revolution" in 1984 by Masanobu Fukuoka (a Japanese scientist turned 
farmer), on his success in natural farming for the last half a century and, translation of his 
book into Malayalam in 1985 were timely in channelising such discussions in Kerala. 
Biodynamic farming was another method of organic farming which attracted many 
farmers.  
The very sustainability of agriculture assumed serious concern in the discussions 
among the farmers and organizations in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, 
Maharashtra, Punjab and Kerala during the same period. The total external dependence of 
farmers for agriculture inputs had started affecting their economies leading to desperation 
among farming communities and ultimately to agrarian crisis. As an alternative, to make 
farming sustainable, Low External Input Sustainable Agriculture (LEISA) thus gained 
momentum in many places, especially sustainable among small and marginal farmers.  The 
agriculture   crisis that began in the late 1990s further strengthened this movement. Many 
 
5
individuals and organizations started interacting with farmers to make them understand the 
problems of the modern agriculture.  
Thus, from a simple beginning, organic farming later matured to such dimensions as 
womenâ€™s empowerment, seed conservation, development of seed banks, value addition 
and, more importantly, food and nutritional security. It took only 10-15 years for this 
transition and the results are encouraging. 
Currently there are a number of certified organic farmers in the state, those cultivating 
cash crops such as spices, tea, and coffee, mainly targeting export market and also non-
certified organic farmers who focus on food crops and biodiversity. All of them, whether 
certified or not, focus clearly on soil health improvement.  Kerala also has an accredited 
organic certifying agency catering to the needs of the farmers.  
Some of the farming systems such as Pokkali and Kaipad cultivation, cultivation of 
Jeerakasala and Gandhakasala varieties of paddy in Wayanad and, homestead farming 
systems all over the state are default organic. Studies have established the economic 
viability and productivity of homestead farms in the State and elsewhere. Recently the Adat 
panchayath in Thrissur district has started organic cultivation of rice in an area of 2,500 
acres, promoting integrated farming system, which is known as Adat model. Similarly 
Marappanmoola in Wayanad has another model organic farming system involving 
hundreds of farmers. 
 Marketing of organic produce is also being experimented in many places like Organic 
Bazaar in Thiruvananthapuram, Eco-shops in Thrissur and Kozhikode and, Jaiva Krishi 
Sevana Kendram in Kannur.  Self help groups of women are encouraged to undertake 
organic farming of vegetables in some panchayats.  
There is a rich potential for promoting organic farming in Kerala in the light that 
intensity of inorganic agriculture here is not that severe compared to that in other States in 
the country. While the national average consumption of fertilizers and pesticides during 
2002-2003 was 90kg/ha and 288g/ha respectively, it was only 60kg/ha and 224g/ha 
respectively in Kerala. This points to the positive side of agriculture in Kerala in terms of 
the already low levels of consumption of hazardous chemicals and, therefore, chances of 
redeeming farmers to organic agriculture are quite high. 
Realising the ground realities, the State Department of Agriculture commenced organic 
farming promotional activities since 2002-03. In the following year, the Department set up 
a cell for Promotion of Sustainable Agriculture and Organic Farming. It has also launched 
two brands, namely â€˜Kerala Organicâ€™ and â€˜Kerala Naturalsâ€™ to market organic farm 
produces. Currently, about 7,000 farmers practice organic farming in the State as per NPOP 
standards, covering a total area of 5750 ha. But non-certified organic cultivation area, 
assessments of which have not been done, is expected to be much more than this.

Benefits of organic farming 
J Makes agriculture more rewarding, sustainable and respectable. 
J Sustains soil fertility by preventing the loss of soil and leaching of minerals. 
J Protects and enriches biodiversity - micro organisms, soil flora and fauna, plants and 
animals. 
J Requires less water and promotes water conservation. 
J Improves and maintains agro ecosystem and natural landscape for sustainable 
production. 
J Depends mostly on renewable on-farm resources.  
J Encourages consumption of renewable energy resources- mechanical and other 
alternate sources of fuel. 
J Includes domestic animals as an essential part of organic system which helps 
maintaining soil fertility and also increases the income of farmers.  
J Ensures pollution free air, water, soil, food and, natural ecosystems. 
J Improves agro-biodiversity (both varieties and crops). 
J Protects and enhances traditional knowledge in farming, processing and seed 
improvement leading to its protection for the future generations. 
J Reduces the cost of production through locally suitable methods and inputs. 
J Produces adequate quantity of nutritious, wholesome and best quality food and 
develops a healthy food culture. 
J Reduces the food - mileage and, thereby, carbon emission. 
The State Government have seized of the importance of organic farming and, realized 
the health hazards and un-sustainability of chemical farming as it clearly states in its 
Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan that the state has to have an organic farming policy 
to protect its rich biodiversity and thus sustain various livelihoods dependent on this 
precious resource. 
Organic Farming Policy, Strategy and Action Plan 
 
Objectives  
1. Make farming sustainable, remunerative and respectable.  
2. Enhance natural soil fertility and productivity.  
3. Ensure soil and water conservation.  
 
7
4. Ensure agricultural bio-security and food and nutritional security.  
5. Create and ensure domestic market for organic products controlled by the farmers.  
6. Avoid the use of agrochemicals and other hazardous material and, ensure chemical - 
free water, soil, air and food.  
7. Ensure seed, food and sovereignty.  
8. Promote biodiversity based ecological farming.   
9. Ensure quality control in organic inputs and agricultural produce 
10. Enable human health promotion by providing safe agricultural  products and 
commodities  
11. Conservation and extension of traditional knowledge related to agriculture. 
FAO put the objectives succinctly:  "Organic agriculture improves food access by 
increasing productivity, diversity and conservation of natural resources, by raising 
incomes and by reducing risks for farmers. Improvement also results from sharing of 
knowledge among farmers. These benefits lead to poverty reduction and a reversal of rural 
outward migration. Policy requirements to improve food access include: increasing 
farmersâ€™ rights to seeds, local varieties and biodiversity; expanding fair-trade systems 
along the full value chain; evaluating current emergency aid and procurement 
programmes; and strengthening the rights of indigenous farmers".  
Strategies and Action Plan 
General approach: The mission to convert Kerala into an organic State is to be 
achieved focusing on potential crops and areas in a phased and compact manner with the 
aim of converting  a minimum of 10% of the cultivable land into entirely organic every 
year and thus achieving the target within five to ten years. On completion of the third year 
of implementation of the organic farming policy, a Committee of experts comprising 
representatives of farmers and scientists should make a comprehensive assessment of the 
farmerâ€™s well being, economy and environment and, only after rectifying the drawbacks, if 
any, can the policy be implemented in rest of the areas. 
Definition of organic farmer 
A farmer may be defined as 'Organic Farmer' provided he/she adherses to and practices 
the following three essentialities of organic farming. 
(1). a farmer who practices mixed farming  including food crops. 
(2).  a farmer who ensures the conservation of soil and water. 
(3).  a farmer who conserves the biodiversity of the farmland.
