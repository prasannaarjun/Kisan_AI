FOREWORD
The Package of Practices: Crops (PoP), published by the
Kerala Agricultural University is widely revered as the most
authentic guide of farmers, scientists, extension officers in line
departments, non-govermental organisations and all other
stakeholders in the field of Agriculture.
This new version of PoP sports not only a fresh look but has
also been substantially updated to cover the latest technologies
and developments. I hope the package of knowledge and
expertise reflected in this compendium will help to enhance the
productivity of our crops and aid to realise the goals of food
security, safety and nutritional security.
Bringing out this voluminous edition, the hallmark of which
is authenticity than popularity, needs great perseverance and
patience. I take this opportunity to congratulate one and all who
have toiled behind this attractive edition of PoP.
I dedicate this repository of valuable information and
recommendations to the farming community of Kerala.

PREFACE
Technology intensive farming that ensure high productivity without
deteriorating the environment is the challenge of the day. Kerala Agricultural
University remains commited to this cause through technology generation and
transfer programmes. In these programmes sustainable food production that
ensure livelihood security of farmers and food safety of society remain the
prime concerns. These commitments are reiterated in the 15th edition of the
Package of Practices Recommendations : Crops  2016 also.
All efforts are made to maintain the long standing credentials of the
publication by including crops suitable for the diverse agro climatic regions of
Kerala. All technical aspects of farming that include high yielding varieties of
crops, use of  bioinputs, small farm mechanization, waste management,
precision farming and introduction of under-exploited fruits, vegetables, tubers
and medicinal plants find a place in this. The generated technologies were
presented, deliberated and finalized in a series of workshops attended by
scientists, extension officers, farmers and input dealers.
I am honoured to publish this much appreciated reference document on
the agricultural technological developments of the State. I am sure it will serve
as a guide to the extension personnel and farming community in the
furtherance of agriculture in our state. My appreciation goes to all the
researchers, administrators, extension personnel, farmers and other staff
members who have contributed their expertise, time and energy to bring out
this valuable document. Special thanks are also due to the Directors of ICAR
institutes in Kerala, Chairpersons of all Commodity Boards who contributed in
making this publication worthy.  Technical support of Dr. D. Ambikadevi
Professor, RARS, Kumarakom and Dr. Joy M. Associate Professor COA, Vellayani
also deserves special mention.
I wish this edition of the Package of Practices Recommendations: Crops
2016 will be a driving force for the scientific transformation of Kerala’s farming
sector.

INTRODUCTION
It is with immense pleasure that I look forward to the release of the
Package of Practices Recommendation : Crops 2016. This is the culmination
of painstaking efforts of research leading to standardization of agro
techniques, proven management of pests and diseases with emphasis on
‘safe to eat food’. These technolgies emanating from actual field experiments,
committed efforts of several scientists, vetting at various levels, interaction
and presentation before eminent scientists of SAU and ICAR, officers of
department of agriculture /development department and commodity boards
had reached its final approval at the POP workshop.
This release of the POP recommendation is the final lap of a relay of
various activities so that this reliable guide for all persons engaged in
agriculture finds meaning and relevance. Besides serving as a ready reckoner
for farmers, field officers and  students, this POP is presented in the most
simple understandable form that it is totally farmer centric and the same
can be understood by anyone.
I will be failing in my duties if I do not place on record the tremendous
service rendered by our scientists who have contributed to this final
outcome. My colleagues in the Directorate of Research, Dr. Jim Thomas,
Dr. V. S. Devadas, Dr. Pathummal Beevi and Dr. Sally K. Mathew of the College
of Horticulture have put in strenuous efforts and need to be acknowledged.
Total coverage of all cultivation aspects and problems of crops grown
in the state have been our focus. I hope this objective has been served. But
agriculture being so dynamic can never be complete and  the Directorate of
Research welcomes all constructive criticism in the best interest of all
stakeholders and farmers in particular.

CEREALS  AND  MILLETS
RICE (Oryza sativa)
Rice can be cultivated under a variety of
climatic and soil conditions. Rice cultivation is
conditioned by temperature parameters at the
different phases of growth. The critical mean
temperature for flowering and fertilization
ranges from 16o to 20oC, whereas, during
ripening, the range is from 18o to 32oC.
Temperature beyond 35oC affects grain filling.
Rice comes up well in different soil types. For
normal growth, a pH range of 5.0-8.0 is
suitable.
In general, rice can be grown as
transplanted or direct sown crop during three
seasons as shown in Table 1 depending on the
agroclimatic situations.
During second crop, for higher yield
in irrigated photosensitive high yielding varieties
in Palakkad district, the crop commencement
may be adjusted in such a way that it flowers
only during the second fortnight of December.
This facilitates proper integration with the
weather, better utilization of applied fertilizers and
high filling percentage. The rice varieties for
Kerala and their characteristics are given as
Table 2 and 3 respectively.

Tips on quality seed production in rice
and maintenance of viability of stored
seeds
Ensure that the seeds for further
multiplication are either from a research station
or government farm or recognized seed
producers.
The land used for seed production should
be free from volunteer plants of other varieties
grown previously.
To ensure genetic purity, a minimum
isolation distance of 3 m from other varieties
may be given in the field. Harvesting for seed
purpose can also be done leaving a border row
of 3 m within the field.
Rogue diseased plants, weeds and off-types
in time.
Line planting facilitates roguing and giving
alleyways of 30 cm after every 3 m  helps in
manuring, plant protection operations and
supervision.
Drain water at least one week before
harvesting to ensure that the plants attain
uniform maturity at harvesting. Harvest the
crop when 80 per cent of the grains in a panicle
are mature (at physiological maturity).
During summer months, ensure that the
plants get sufficient water at dough stage till
maturity.
Thresh the sheaves on the same day of
harvest, as seeds of heaped sheaves may not
perform well.
Dry seeds properly and ensure that
the moisture content is not more than
13 per cent.
Avoid excess drying in summer months
especially for short duration varieties as it
reduces the period of viability.
While drying and storing, avoid
contamination from yards or through baskets
or bags.
Seeds may be stored in damp-proof
situations for avoiding absorption of moisture
from atmosphere thereby losing viability early.
Polythene bags of 700 gauge or double
gunny bags may be preferred for storing.
Polythene bags of 400 gauge density may
be preferred for storing paddy seeds dried to
10 per cent moisture content or less.
Never stack seed bags in open floors. Store
on pallets or wooden benches. The benches
should be 30 cm away from wall and floor for
proper aeration.
Never pile more than eight bags in a stack.
This should be limited to three bags if the seeds
require further drying.
Avoid storing plant protection chemicals,
herbicides, fertilizers etc. in seed store.
Fill up the cracks and crevices of storeroom
by cementing to make it rat proof.
Spray 2 per cent malathion solution in the
godown before storing seeds to check insect
pests.
Place pieces of cloth dipped in neem oil
between stacked bags or neem oil cake
covered in cloth bags inside seed bags to ward-
off pests.
Test seed germination at monthly intervals
if the seeds are to be stored for more than
eight months.
The viability of short duration varieties can
be extended for a further period of 2-3 months
at 80 per cent level if the seeds are soaked for
four hours in water and re-dried in shade, back
to original weight at 13 per cent moisture
content. Seeds of short duration varieties like
Jyothi and Triveni of virippu crop reach this
level of germination 9-10 months after harvest
and that of mundakan 8-9 months after harvest
when stored under ambient conditions.
RICE

To keep sprouted pokkali seeds viable for
two weeks, the seeds are to be kept in baskets
made of plaited coconut leaves lined with
koova, banana, karingotta or teak leaves.
Seed rate
Transplanting            60-85 kg ha-1
Broadcasting            80-100 kg ha-1
Dibbling                    80-90 kg ha-1
The above seed rates are specified for
farmers’ field on the basis of minimum
germination of 80 per cent. In pokkali
cultivation, for Vyttila varieties, 100 kg ha-1 may
be sown on the beds or mounds formed in the
field.
Seed rate may be enhanced from
80-100 kg ha-1 to 125 kg ha-1 for Kuttanad,
provided excess plants are removed in order
to maintain optimum plant population.
Seed treatment
Dry seed treatment
Dress seeds with P. fluorescenes
@ 10 g/kg of seeds before sowing or with the
following fungicides on the previous day of
sowing (12 to 16 hours ahead) at dosage given
below:
Carbendazim  2g per kg of seed
Wet seed treatment
Soak seed for 12  to 16 hours in a solution
of P. fluorescenes @ 10 g/litre of water
per kg of seed or Carbendazim 2 g/kg of seed
per litre of water and drain to induce
germination.
Treatment with Carbendazim will protect
the seedlings from blast disease up to 30 to 60
days after sowing.
The above seed treatment can also be used
for protection from seedling blast in endemic
areas.
Soak paddy seeds in CuSO4 (0.25 per
cent) and ZnSO4 (1 per cent) solution for
24 hours. Drain and keep for sprouting. For
soaking 1 kg of seed, 1 litre of micronutrient
solution would be needed.
Nursery
For transplanting, healthy seedlings have
to be raised in seedbed. Healthy seedlings can
cope up better with the field conditions that
affect the growth of young rice plants. Adopt
wet or dry method for raising seedlings. The
choice depends primarily on the availability of
water.
Wet method
The wet method can be adopted in areas
where water is available as in the second crop
season. Seedlings raised by the wet bed
method can be harvested one week earlier.
The seedbed should be prepared in advance,
so that the pre-germinated seeds can be sown
in time. As far as possible, fertile lands with
irrigation and drainage facilities should be
selected for raising the nurseries. Such lands
should be suitably located to receive full
sunlight. The following are the steps in raising
wet nursery.
Plough and harrow the fields two or three
times until the soil is thoroughly puddled and
levelled. Prepare raised beds 5 to 10 cm height
1 to 1.5 m width and of convenient length with
drainage channels between the beds. The total
seedbed area should be 1000 m2 for each
hectare of the field to be transplanted.
Apply compost or cattle manure @ 1.0
kgm-2 of the nursery bed and mix well with
the soil at the time of preparation of the field.
Treat the seeds by wet method. Drain and
incubate in warm moist place for sprouting.
Never allow the seeds to dry up. Moisten them
occasionally. Sow germinated seeds on the
third day. Delay will result in poor seedling
stand.
14
RICE
Irrigation may be commenced on the
5th day after sowing and continued up to the
7th day, to a depth of about 5 cm. After this
period, irrigate the seedbed continuously to a
depth of about 5 cm in order to control weeds.
Drain occasionally to encourage production
of vigorous seedlings with short roots. Flooding
the soil with too much water for long periods
produces tall and weak seedlings, which do
not readily recover during transplanting.
If symptoms of nitrogen deficiency are
observed, broadcast urea @ 1 kg for 100 m2
as top dressing about 10 days prior to pulling
out of seedlings, depending upon the duration
of variety.
Dry method
This method is practised in areas where
sufficient water is not available and the time
of planting is uncertain. During first crop
season, wherever transplanting is done
depending upon receipt of rainfall, it is safer
to adopt this method since growth of the
seedlings can be controlled.
Plough the nursery area to a fine tilth.
Prepare raised beds of 1 to 1.5 m width,
15 cm in height and of convenient length. Apply
compost or cattle manure at the rate of 1 kg/m2
of the nursery bed and mix well with the soil
at the time of preparation of the field.
Sow the seeds treated as described under
dry seed treatment method evenly over the
bed and cover with fine sand or soil.
Water the nursery as and when required
depending upon the receipt of rains.
Note: Rice seedlings from solarised nursery
beds show high initial growth, early
maturity and resistance to leaf blast
disease.
Age of seedlings
Seedlings are ready to be pulled out when
they attain the stage of 4-5 leaves, about 18
days after sowing in the case of short duration
varieties and 20-25 days after sowing in the
case of medium duration varieties. Under ill
drained conditions, long duration varieties may
be planted 30 days after sowing. Seedlings
more than 30 days old when transplanted in
the field recover slower than younger
seedlings, especially, if they suffer stem and
root injury. However, during the virippu season,
age of seedlings can go up to 35 days in case
of medium duration varieties and 25 days for
short duration varieties. If the seedlings are
over aged, plant at a closer spacing with 3 or
4 seedlings per hill and apply extra dose of
nitrogen @ 5 kg/ha as basal dressing.
Irrigate seed beds a day before pulling out
the seedlings to soften the soil and to facilitate
washing of roots. Wash off mud and soil from
the roots carefully and tie the seedlings into
bundles of convenient size for transplanting.
Pruning of the top portion and root is not
recommended as it inflicts wounds through
which disease causing organisms may
subsequently enter.
Preparation of land
General
Plough the field thoroughly to incorporate
the weeds and straw into the soil. Ensure a
smooth, level field for transplanting the
seedlings. It would be better to transplant
10-15 days after incorporating organic manure.
Before transplanting or sowing, apply manures
and fertilizers at the rates specified for the
region and varieties as indicated in Table 4.
Apply fertilizers on the drained soil at the time
of final ploughing and levelling and thoroughly
mix into the soil.
Kuttanad
Drain out standing water from the main
field. Plough the field thoroughly to incorporate
the weeds in the field. Ensure a smooth and
15
RICE
levelled field. Maintain a thin film of water to
facilitate sowing so that the germinated seeds
do not get covered with clayey soil, which
affects seedling establishment.
In Kari soils, avoid cracking of soils by
prolonged drying since it will lead to severe
acidity. Provide surface drains of 20 cm  width
and depth within the field at 10-20 m interval
or running diagonally (kachals) and join them
with surface drain of 30 cm width and depth
taken along the perimeter of the field (vachals).

Kole
For the first crop in Kole, after the cessation
of the heavy monsoon, dewatering is effected
by petti and para or centrifugal pump and
rarely by chakkram. Land is ploughed
thoroughly and transplanting is done.
For the second crop, land is prepared
thoroughly and direct sowing of sprouted seeds
or transplanting is done.
Onattukara
With the onset of pre-monsoon showers,
land is ploughed thoroughly. Dibbling of
17
RICE
unsprouted seeds behind the country plough is
the common practice.
Pokkali and Kaipad
By April, the bunds are being strengthened
and sluices repaired for regulating water level.
Fields are then drained during low tide and the
sluices are closed. When the soil in the field
becomes dry, mounds of 1 m base and 0.5 m
height are formed. This facilitates the washing
down of the dissolved salts from the surface
of the mounds with the onset of monsoon,
which are ultimately removed from the field
by tidal action. The mounds act as elevated
in situ nursery and protect the seedlings from
flash floods.
A special method is adopted for sprouting
the seeds. The seeds are tightly packed in
baskets made of plaited coconut leaves, the
inside of which is lined by banana or teak
leaves. These baskets are then immersed in
fresh water ponds for 12 to 15 hours. They
are then taken out and stored in shade. The
radicle just sprouts and remains quiescent
under this condition for more than 30 days.
When the soil and weather conditions
become favourable for sowing, the baskets
containing the seeds are re-soaked for 3 to 6
hours before sowing. The mounds in the field
are then raked and top levelled. The sprouted
seeds are sown on the top of mounds, which act
as an in situ nursery. When the seedlings reach
a height of 40-45 cm (in 30-35 days), the mounds
are cut into pieces with a few seedlings,
which are uniformly spread in the field.
Koottumundakan
In this system of rice cultivation, a mixture
of seeds of a non-photosensitive (virippu)
variety and a photosensitive (mundakan)
variety of rice in the proportion 70:30 (w/w) is
sown during virippu season. This system is
practiced in areas where sowing / planting of
mundakan crop is not possible due to excess
water in the field. Hence, mixture of the two
varieties is sown in the first crop season (April-
May). The first crop variety will be ready for
harvest in August-September and the second
crop variety can be harvested in December-
January. No cultivation is practised after the
harvest of first crop season variety. But both
organic and inorganic manures are applied and
incorporated. Though the yield will be less than
that of the two independent crops, this type of
cultivation is taken up in view of the special
circumstances prevailing in such areas.
Transplanting
Transplant seedlings of appropriate age for
the variety @ 2-3 seedlings per hill in rows, at
spacing as shown in Table 5. Leave wider row
of 30 cm after every 3 m to facilitate spraying
and other cultural operations. Transplant
seedlings at a depth of 3-4 cm.

Wet seeding by seed drums and weed
control by cono weeder
•
Drum seeding and cono weeding can be safely
adopted.
•
It is suitable for areas where efficient water
management is possible (especially during
rabi) and during kharif in areas where
torrential rains are absent.
•
For short duration varieties 15cm spaced
and for medium duration varieties 20cm
spaced seed drum is recommended.
• SRI (System of Rice Intensification) is a
method of rice cultivation introduced by
French priest  Fr. Henry D Laulanie in 1983
in Madagascar and the technology was
spread in other countries by Dr. Norman
Uphoff of Cornell University, USA.
(Principles of SRI given as Annexure XV).
Manuring
Organic manuring
Apply organic manure in the form of
farmyard manure or compost or green leaf
@ 5 t ha-1 and  incorporate into the soil while
ploughing. Vermicompost or coirpith compost
@ 2.5 t ha-1 can be substituted for 5 t ha-1
FYM in Onattukara region. The entire quantity
of phosphatic fertilizers may be applied along
with the organic manures.
Use of biofertilizers is recommended (See
chapter on biofertilizers).
Green crop manuring
Cowpea may be raised as an intercrop in
dry seeded low land (semi-dry) rice by sowing
12.5 kg/ha  seed  along with rice to serve as a
source of green manure. When the rice field
gets submerged with the onset of south west
monsoon, cowpea at the age of about six weeks
and at active vegetative stage decays and gets
self-incorporated in the soil adding substantial
quantity of green manure. Such a system of
concurrent growing of cowpea also reduces
weed pressure in semi-dry rice.
Concurrent growing of cowpea/daincha
A.  Dry seeded rice
When there is an undue delay in the onset
of monsoon, concurrently grown cowpea  in
rice fields can be incorporated by spraying
2,4 –D @ 1.0 kg ha-1 at 30-40 days after sowing
without affecting the yield  with a substantial
reduction on weed incidence.
B. Wet seeded rice
In wet seeded rice, daincha can be raised
as an intercrop by sowing 20 kg seed of
daincha ha-1 along with rice (seed rate 60 kg
ha-1) to serve as a source of green manure.
Daincha can be incorporated by spraying
2, 4–D @ 1.0 kg ha-1 at 30 days after sowing
thereby adding substantial quantity of green
manure. System of concurrent growing of
daincha can also reduce the weed pressure in
wet seeded rice.
Fertilizer application
The rates of N, P2O5 and K2O
recommended as fertilizers are given in Table
4 and stages of application in Table 6.
For modan cultivation (upland crop) and
direct seeded crop in wet lands, apply nitrogen
in three equal split doses, first as basal dressing,
second at tillering stage (three weeks after
seeding) and the third at panicle initiation stage
(about thirty days before flowering). Apply the
full dose of phosphorus  at the time of land
preparation as basal dressing. Apply potash
either in a single dose as basal or in two split
doses half as basal and half at the panicle
initiation stage.
In Kuttanad region, wherever wet
broadcasting (direct seeding) is adopted,
give the first basal application of the nitrogen
at the time of letting in water after drying the
field. Water-soluble phosphorus can be
recommended for application in two split doses
RICE
18
in Kuttanad region, as basal and at maximum
tillering stage.
The general principle to be followed is that
in light soils as well as in soils with high
leaching, nitrogen may be applied in three or
four split doses according to the duration of
the variety.
For typical Onattukara region, where
soil is sandy loam and with iron toxicity

problem, apply 5 tonnes of organic matter or
vermicompost 2.5 t  and 67.5 kg K2O ha-1.
During the first crop season, when basal
application of nitrogen is not possible due to
incessant rains, basal dose can be shifted to
15 days after transplanting.
In coarse sandy loam soils with high
percolation as in Onattukara region, nitrogen
and potash fertilizers may be applied in five
equal splits  at planting, 15th, 38th, 53rd and 70th
day for medium duration varieties which
coincide with the stages of early tillering, neck
node differentiation, early reduction division
and heading stages respectively in the case of
medium duration varieties.
For Thiruvananthapuram and Malappuram
districts, phosphorus application is essential for
increasing rice yields. Rock phosphate may
be substituted for superphosphate.
Basal dose of nitrogen may be postponed
to initial tillering phase of rice crop, especially
during the rainy season.  Split application of
potash @ 50 per cent basal, 25 per cent at
tillering and 25per cent at panicle initiation
stage is recommended for this region.
In sequential cropping of rice, application
of 50 per cent of the nutrient requirement (on
nitrogen equivalent basis) as organics (FYM,
rice straw, green manure) and 50 per cent as
fertilizers during kharif season and the entire
dose of nutrients as fertilizers in rabi season
enhances the grain and straw yield. The
organics may be incorporated 3 weeks before
transplanting.
Application of 25 per cent of the nutrient
requirement as organics and 75 per cent as
fertilizers during kharif season and reducing
the fertilizer dose of rabi by 25 per cent
gives comparable yield with full POP
recommendation during both seasons.
Specific dose of fertilizer for
Koottumundakan system
A fertilizer dose of N:P2O5:K2O 20:10:10
kg ha-1 for the first crop and 30:15:15 kg
ha-1 for the second crop is recommended for
high yield in Koottumundakan system. N and
K2O may be applied in two equal parts for the
first crop, one as basal and other at panicle
initiation stage. P2O5 may be applied fully as
basal. The fertilizer for second crop may be
applied as a single dose immediately after
the harvest of the first crop (ad hoc
recommendation).
Fertilizers (N:P2O5:K2O) @ 40:20:20 kg ha-1
for virippu and 20:10:10 kg ha-1 for the
photosensitive 
mundakan 
crop 
are
recommended as economic dose for the
northern region under Koottumundakan
practice.
Methods of fertilizer application
For pre-planting application, apply the
fertilizers at the final ploughing. In areas where
availability of water is assured, temporarily
draining the field one day prior to application
and re-flooding after twelve hours is
recommended for top dressing of fertilizer.
For increasing the efficiency of urea for
top dressing, mix urea with six times its weight
of slightly moist soil and apply to the field 24-
28 hours after mixing. Oil seed cakes such as
punna and neem cakes can also be mixed with
urea (1 part of oil cake + 5 parts of urea by
weight) for increasing fertilizer use efficiency.
This method is particularly useful for basal
application of nitrogen. Under special
conditions of drought and water-logging, apply
nitrogen as foliar spray. Urea may be applied
as a low volume spray at 15 per cent
concentration using power sprayer or at 5 per
cent concentration using a high volume sprayer,
the quantity applied in one application being
limited to 15 kg ha-1.
When zinc deficiency is noticed, apply zinc
sulphate @ 20 kg ha-1. Early stages of zinc
20
RICE
deficiency are evidenced by interveinal
chlorosis, bleaching of midribs and light yellow
colouration of the leaf. Older leaves develop
brown rusty spots and are extremely brittle.
Zinc sulphate and potash should not be applied
on the same day.
In Kari soils of Kuttanad, apply Dolomite
@ 450Kg/ha as two splits, half at the time of
initial ploughing and half as top dressing one
week prior to the application of fertilizers at
the PI stage.
The effect of zinc application can persist
upto five years depending on the soil and
cropping pattern. Hence soil application is not
required for every season. Soil zinc status
should be monitored before application to avoid
accumulating toxic concentration of zinc.
Split application of water-soluble phosphatic
fertilizers in two equal splits as basal and at
maximum tillering stage is effective in giving
higher grain and straw yield than the full dose
as basal dressing under certain situations.
When the soil has less than 10 ppm of
calcium chloride extractable sulphur or
15 ppm of phosphate extractable sulphur,
substitute urea with ammonium phosphate
sulphate to correct sulphur deficiency. For
medium duration rice grown in brown
hydromorphic soils ammonium phosphate
sulphate may be used to supply 25 kg sulphur
per hectare to protect the crop from sulphur
deficiency (ad hoc recommendations).
K status of soil is maintained by straw
incorporation. After straw incorporation,
if soil analysis prior to cropping season
indicates low K status, K should be applied
@ 15 kg K2O ha -1.
Application of magnesium as basal
dose in the form of magnesium sulphate
(16 per cent MgO) or magnesite (40 per cent
MgO) or dolomite (10 per cent MgO)
@ 20 kg MgO/ha is effective in giving a
significant increase  in grain and straw yield
of rice in magnesium deficient soils. In non-
deficient soils, a marginal increase in grain and
straw yield is also obtained. On per unit MgO
basis, magnesite is more concentrated and
cheaper than magnesium sulphate.
In iron toxic laterite soils of Kerala,
application of 120 kg  potash ha-1 + lime 150
kg ha-1 + silica 100 kg ha-1 (as sodium silicate
250 kg ha-1 or fine silica 100 kg ha-1 or rice
husk ash 500 kg ha-1) is recommended for
higher yields.
Liming
In general, addition of lime is absolutely
necessary when the pH is lower than 5.5 and
it is advisable when pH varies between 5.5
and 6.5.
Apply lime @ 600 kg ha-1 in two split doses,
the first dose of 350 kg ha-1 as basal dressing
at the time of first ploughing and the second
dose of 250 kg ha-1 as top dressing about one
month after sowing/transplanting.
A time lag of one week should be given
between application of lime and fertilizers. For
top dressing, lime may be applied one week
prior to the application of fertilizers.
Water management
Maintain water level at about 1.5 cm during
transplanting. Thereafter increase it gradually
to about 5 cm until maximum tillering stage.
Drain water 13 days before harvest.
21
RICE
Note: In areas where water for irrigation is
assured and where acidity is high,
draining and reflooding every 15 days
is  recommended. In flood prone
areas, aged seedlings of Mahsuri or
other varieties recommended for
waterlogged conditions may be planted.
The date of planting may be adjusted
so as  to avoid synchronization of the
critical stages of maximum tillering or
heading with the usual flood period in
the tract.
During the mundakan crop season,
water level of 5 cm need not be maintained
continuously after the cessation of northeast
monsoon. Five centimetre irrigation once in
6 days will be quite adequate for project areas
where water is assured.
For summer rice (in situation where the
ground water level is low, i.e., within 1m from
the surface), 5 cm irrigation two days after
disappearance of ponded water is sufficient
instead of 5 cm continuous submergence
throughout the crop period.
Irrigation schedule for rice under limited
water resources
For summer rice under limited resources
of water, phasic stress irrigation can be
practised to the advantage of saving substantial
quantity of irrigation water without any
significant reduction in yield. About
20-30 per cent more area can be irrigated with
the same water resources by adopting any of
the following phasic stress irrigation schedules
(Table 7). Depending up on the schedule, water
saving ranges from 24-36 per cent of the
requirement for 5 cm continuous submergence
throughout the crop growth. Grain yield
reduction in the above practice is only 0.1 per
cent to 1.6 per cent.
Weeds and their management
Common weeds in rice fields of Kerala are:
Grasses:Oryza rufipogon (varinellu),
Echinochloa crusgalli (kavada), E. colona
(kavada), E. stagnina (kavada), Sacciolepis
interrupta (polla), Isachne miliacea
(chovverippullu, naringa).
Sedges: Cyperus iria (manjakora, chengoal),
C. difformis (thalekkattan), Fimbristylis

iii. Broad spectrum
1. Weed free seeds : Use seeds from weedy
rice free areas.
2. Stale seed bed technique:
After land preparation, withhold sowing and
allow the weedy rice seeds in the top layers
of the soil to germinate.  After two weeks,
when most of the seeds would have
germinated, destroy the germinated seedlings
by ploughing the field or by spraying non
selective herbicides like glyphosate or
glufosinate ammonium @ 8 ml product/litre of
water.  If time permits repeat the process once
again. When the seedlings starts yellowing
4-5 days after herbicide application, let in water
and flood the field to allow complete kill of the
emerged seedlings.
Drain the field after 10 days of flooding
and broadcast the germinated rice seeds,
without further ploughing. In fields with very
severe infestation, skip the crop for one season
and go for repeated stale seed bed operations
to exhaust the soil seed bank of weedy rice.
3. Pre sowing herbicide application to
prevent the establishment of weedy
rice seedlings
After land preparation, drain the field to
retain only a thin film of water. Apply
oxyfluorfen @ 0.2 kg ai/ha either by spraying
or sprinkling with a rose can or broadcasting
after mixing with sand. Allow the water in the
field to evaporate. After three to four days,
when the standing water has evaporated,
broadcast pre germinated rice seeds.The
herbicide applied will prevent the emergence
of weeds (including weedy rice) for about two
weeks. Most of the rice seeds sown above
this layer can germinate.
4. Direct contact application of herbicides
to kill the earheads
Weedy rice produce earheads about
10-15 days ahead of rice. The quick growth
just before flowering, results in about 15-30 cm
height difference between rice and weedy
rice. Utilizing this, non selective herbicides like
glyphosate or glufosinate ammonium can be
applied directly on to the earheads of weedy
rice, using the KAU Weed Wiper specially
designed for this purpose.  Mix 100 ml of the
herbicide (formulation of glyphosate or
glufosinate ammonium) in one litre of water.
Care should be taken not to apply the herbicide
on the leaves of rice. The earheads of weedy
rice will dry within 5 days.

Management of Salvinia molesta
(African payal)
Trampling salvinia in situ in the wet lands
a week before transplanting will control the
weed and add to soil fertility. Herbicides
should be applied only in areas where
protected drinking water supply is available
Precaution while using herbicides
(1) Apply herbicides at the recommended
dose and time. (2) Drain the field before
herbicide application. (3) Re-flood after
48 hours to prevent further weed germination
when post emergent herbicides are used. For
pre-emergent herbicides, wait for a week
before re-flooding the field. (4) Use herbicide
nozzle (flood jet / flat fan) for herbicide
application. (5) Move at uniform speed when
applying herbicides. (6) Spray without gaps and
overlapping. (7) Use 300-400 litres of water
per hectare for spraying the herbicide.
Pests and Diseases
Adopt control measures only if the pest /
disease population exceeds the economic
threshold levels which are given in
Table 8. A general guide for rice pest control
is given as Table 10.
Pests
Rice stem borer
(Scirpophaga incertulas)
Symptoms
In the vegetative phase, the central shoot
dies off turning yellow in colour (dead heart).
In the ear bearing stage, the ear head appears
completely chaffy and white in colour (white
ear head). Both come out easily when pulled
up and show indication of feeding injuries at
the base.
Management
1. Collect egg masses from the nursery plants
and observe for parasitisation.
2. Cultivate tolerant/resistant varieties in
endemic areas.
3. In areas where stem borer occurs as a
serious pest in all seasons, apply any one
of the following insecticides first
15-20 days after transplantation and then
at the boot leaf stage keeping minimum
water level: Cartap hydrochloride, Quinal-
phos, Carbosulfan, Fipronil, Chlorantra-
niliprole, Flubendiamide, Indoxacarb,
Malathion or Spinosad.
For eco friendly management of rice
stem borer the following practices can be
adopted.
4. Use sex pheromone for the control of rice
stem borer as detailed in Table 9.
5. Bacillus thuringiensis @  200g/ha, fish
jaggery extract @ 6ml/l, Chitin based
Pseudomonas @ 2.5kg/ha, Trichogramma
japonicum and T. chilonis each @ 1 lakh/
ha + Beauveria bassiana @10 gm/l,
Azadirachtin 1% @ 750ml/ha.
Gall midge (Orseolia oryzae)
Symptoms
Presence of silver shoot is the symptom.
The symptom appears from the nursery to the
flowering stage. However, in very young
seedling the silver shoots are not always
expressed. Instead, a swelling at the basal
portion and excess tillering are noticed.
Management
1. Use tolerant varieties like Pavithra,
Panchami and Uma.
2. Avoid late transplantation during the first
crop season.
3. Careful monitoring of the crop seasons in
the month of July during additional crop
season and October during puncha season.

           (2) When natural enemies of brown plant hopper, green leaf hopper, stem borers and leaf folders are present,
application of chemicals can be delayed or dispensed with.
Rice bug (Leptocorisa acuta)
Symptoms
Look for the presence of bug in the field
during the early ear bearing stage. Due to
desapping, grains show brownish discoloured
patches on the husk.
Management
1. Strict vigilance is necessary at milky
stage.
2. Keep the field and bunds free of weeds
and grasses.
28
RICE
4. Use optimum seed rate of 100 kg ha-1
5. Destruction of collateral host like wild rice,
Cynodon dactylon, Ischaemum aristatum,
Echinochloa spp. and Isachne sp.
6. Dipping germinated seed in 0.2 per cent
chlorpyrifos solution for 3 h before sowing.
7. In transplanted crop root dip seedlings in
0.02 per cent chlorpyrifos suspension for
12 h prior to planting.
8. Nursery treatment has to be followed by
main field treatment, 10-15 days after
transplantation using carbosulfan 6 G/
Chlorantraniliprole 0.4 G/Fipronil 0.3 G.
9. In areas where the pest is of regular
occurrence, apply chlorpyriphos 10G
(0.5 kg ai/ha) within 10 days after sowing.
The granules should be broadcast in
2-3 cm of water and the field should be
impounded for at least 4 days.
3. Avoid overlapping cultivation in an Ela.
4. When the bug is seen in large numbers
apply Malathion.
Note: Since the occurrence of the bug
coincides with the flowering stage,
application of the insecticide may be
done either before 9 a.m. or after
3 p.m. so that fertilization of the flowers
is not adversely affected.
For eco friendly management of Rice bug
the following practice can be adopted.

Leaf folder (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis)
Symptoms
The leaves of the plant are seen folded,
rolled and often webbed together with white
patches on them indicating the areas fed by
caterpillar. When such folded leaves are
opened up, larvae can be seen. Shaded
conditions and application of excess nitrogen
are conducive for leaf folder attack.
Management
1. Open up the leaf folds with the help of a
thorny twig.
2. Apply one of the following insecticides in
the field where the symptoms of attack are
manifested: quinalphos, phosalone,
acephate, flubendiamide, cartap hydro-
chloride, indoxacarb, carbosulfan 6 G,
Chlorantraniliprole 0.4 G and dichlorvos.
Note: In the initial stages restrict spraying to
infested patches only. The field may be
sprayed completely in case the
infestation occurs uniformly.
For eco friendly management of Rice Leaf
folder the following practices can be practised.
1. Trichogramma japonicum and T. chilonis
each @ 1 lakh/ha + Beauveria bassiana
@10 gm/l

Brown plant hopper (Nilaparvata lugens)
Symptoms
Yellowish circular patches appear here and
there in field. The plants in these areas dry up
29
RICE
very soon (hopper burn) and the yellowing and
drying extend rapidly. Examine the plants as
soon as the yellowing appears. Presence of
the hoppers at the base of the plants confirms
the infestation. Very close planting leads to
enhanced attack.
Management
1. Use tolerant varieties for cultivation.
2. Apply one of the following insecticides as
soon as the yellowing symptom is observed,
covering the infested patches and the areas
surrounding the patches: quinalphos,
acephate, thiamethoxam, phosalone,
buprofexin, ethofenprox and imidacloprid.
While spraying, care has to be taken to see
that the insecticides reach the base of the
plants.
3. Drain away water from the field and keep
it in that conditions until the pest population
dwindle.
4. In Kuttanad tract, early planting of paddy
in September-October is advisable,
wherever possible.
5. Allow alleways after every 3m rows.
6. Avoid spraying synthetic pyrethroids.
Rice case worm (Nymphula depunctalis)
Symptoms
Leaves of plants are eaten by the
caterpillars, which remain within small
cylindrical cases and are seen hanging on the
leaves. It occurs in ill drained fields. The cases
may be seen floating on water also.
Management
Drain away the water from the fields.
For eco friendly management of Rice
Case worm the following can be practised.
Chitin based Pseudomonas @ 2.5kg/ha-1,
Azadirachtin 1% @ 750 ml/ha-1
Rice swarming caterpillar
(Spodoptera mauritia)
Symptoms
It appears in the field sporadically and
cyclically in large swarms and feed on crops
gregariously. The nursery and early stages of
the crop are attacked leaving the plant as mere
stumps.
Management
Flood the field as soon as the caterpillars
are noticed.
Rice hispa (Dicladispa armigera)
Symptoms
The adults feed on the green tissues of the
leaves and the feeding scars appear as short
white lines on the leaf surface. The grubs mine
the leaves causing formation of white blotches.
Early stages of the crop are more susceptible.
Rice thrips (Stenchaetothrips biformis)
Symptoms
The crop is highly susceptible in the nursery
stage for the first 23-25 days after
transplanting/sowing. The tips of leaves get
rolled longitudinally into needle like outgrowths
and turn whitish. In severe cases, the lower
leaves also turn yellowish. The infestation may
be rated as mild, if there is less than three
needle like leaves and as severe, if there are
more than three outgrowths with the lower
leaves also showing chlorosis and scorching.
Management
In severe infestations, apply DDVP 100 per
cent EC/AF 250 ml/ha or dimethoate or
quinalphos or phenthoate (EC/AF formulation).
Whorl maggots (Hydrellia philippina)
Infestation is common in the nurseries and
in the main fields up to six weeks after
transplantation. Yellowish patches and streaks
are seen along the margins of leaves, which
may become deformed.
Leaf hoppers (Nephotettix spp.)
Symptoms
General yellowing of the leaves is seen, if
the attack is severe. When the plants are
disturbed, the jassids are seen jumping out.
Management
Apply quinalphos, imidacloprid if needed.
Rice mealy bug (Brevennia rehi)
Symptoms
Weak yellowish stunted plants are seen in
patches. White waxy fluff is seen in leaf
sheaths.
Management
Dimethoate 0.05 per cent is effective in
controlling the pest.
Rice root nematode (Hirschmanniella
oryzae)
Symptoms
Infests paddy roots and make them partially
hollow. Feeding adversely affects absorption
of water and nutrients. Plants show stunted
growth in patches. Tiller production is affected.
Management
Dip the roots of seedlings in 0.2 per cent
dimethoate for six hours before transplanting
in tracts where nematode attack is detected.
Rice cyst nematode
(Heteroderaoryzicola)
The cyst nematode occurs in various
proportions in certain areas of the State. The
symptoms of infestation include leaf chlorosis,
stunting and reduction in the number of leaves,
earhead length etc. In seriously affected
patches, yield is substantially reduced.

Note :
1. Sub-lethal concentration of insecticides
may lead to pest resurgence.
2. Granular application is recommended only
upto the booting stage.
3. Spot application method should be resorted
to wherever possible
4. Use 200, 300 and 500 1/ha of spray fluid
at 10, 25, 45 DAT or 30, 45, 60 DAS
respectively for high volume spray
equipment.
5. When low volume spray equipment is used
the spray fluid can be limited to 90, 120,
180 1/ha, but the quantity of insecticide
should remain the same as used in high
volume spray 200, 300 and 500 1/ha
respectively.
6. Waiting periods for quinalphos and
malathion are 7 and 3 days respectively.
7. In regions where BPH is a regular pest
avoid the application of the following
insecticides due to the chances of
resurgence to synthetic pyrethroids and
quinalphos.
Diseases
A guide on control of rice diseases has been
included as Table 11.
Fungal diseases
Blast (Pyricularia grisea)
Major symptoms of the disease are leaf
blast and neck blast. Sometimes nodal infection
is also seen.
Symptoms on leaves appear as spindle
shaped water soaked greyish green spots,
which gradually enlarge in size and develop to
spots with grey centre and brown margin.
Such spots coalesce together resulting in drying
up of the leaves and collapse of the entire plant.
The fungus infects the nodes of the stem and
the neck of the panicle causing dark brown to
black lesions resulting in rotten nodes and necks
which subsequently result in node blast and
neck blast respectively. This will also lead to
breaking of the stem at the nodal region and
the panicle at the neck region. The grains will
be partially filled or unfilled. If the panicle is
infected before grain filling stage, the entre
panicle will be chaffy.
* Dosage applies to the crop stage of booting and beyond.  For early stages the quantity of
insecticides can be reduced

Sheath blight (Rhizoctonia solani)
Symptoms first appear on the lower leaf
sheath near the water level as oval, oblong or
irregular greenish grey spots, which enlarge
and become greyish white with brown margin.
Under favouarble conditions, the disease
spread to the leaves also. Irregular greenish
grey lesions with dark brown margins develop
on leaves. Under humid conditions, white
mycelial growth of the fungus as well as
initially white and later brown sclerotia of the
fungus loosely attached to the affected portion
are also seen.
Brown spot (Helminthosporium oryzae)
On the leaves small definite spots of oval
or oblong shape and dark brown colour are
formed. On susceptible varieties, spots are
larger in size and are having light brown or
grey center with dark reddish brown margin.
The symptoms also appear on glumes as black
oval or oblong spots or whole surface of the
grain turn black and velvety.
Narrow brown spot (Cercospora oryzae)
Numerous narrow linear short brown spots
are formed on the leaves.
Stack burn (Alternaria padwickii)
Symptoms appear on leaves as large oval
or circular dark brown lesions with narrow
distinct margins. On the affected grains pale
brown to whitish spots with dark brown margin
bearing black dosts in the center are formed.
Leaf scald (Rhynchosporium oryzae)
Lesions with typical zonations with dark
coloured wavy lines usually start from the tip
of the leaves and extend downwards or arise
from the margin and advance inside.
Sheath rot (Sarocladium oryzae)
The fungus infects the leaf sheath enclosing
the panicle causing oblong or irregular brown
spots which later develop into a lesion with
dark brown margin and grey center. The young
panicle remains inside the sheath or rather
chocked and emerge only partially. The grains
become chaffy. A white powdery growth of
the fungus can be seen on the surface of rotten
sheath particularly inside the sheath.
False smut (Ustilaginoidea vireus)
The symptoms visible only after flowering
when infected grains get transformed to yellow
to orange spore balls, which later turns to dark
green or black.
Udbatta (Ephelis oryzae)
Whole panicle transformed into a cylindrical
rod covered with white mycelia. Later they
become hard bearing many black dots.
Foot rot (Fusarium moniliformae)
Drying of leaves and leaf sheath,
discolouration of lower nodes and adventitous
root formation are the major symptoms. Plants
turn pale yellowish green, thin and some times
show abnormal elongation or rot in patches in
the field.
Bacterial diseases
Bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae p v.
oryzae)
Bacterial blight is characterised by two
phases of infection namely viz. Kresek and
leaf blight. Kresek is drying or wilting of the
whole plant. It affects the crop in early stages
of growth in nurseries and upto 3-4 weeks
after transplanting. The infected leaves
become grayish green and begin to roll along
the midrib and dry, In severe cases, the
affected hills may be completely killed.
33
RICE
a) Apply neem cake-coated urea as
recommended under fertilizer appli-
cation.
b) Apply 50 per cent more potash than
normal recommended dosage in split
application.
c) Control weeds as suggested under
weed control.
5. For control of sheath rot, spray the
fungicides at the time of panicle
emergence.
6. In organic farming, for the management of
sheath blight of rice, spray Azadirachtin
0.03 per cent EC or Azadirachtin 0.15 per
cent w/w @ 2.5 litres ha-1 at the time of
first disease appearance.
7. Spraying of recommended fungicide,
preferably dithio carbamate before the
heading stage of the crop may be followed
for the control of false smut and leaf scald
diseases. Wherever control measures are
adopted for sheath blight and sheath rot
diseases, separate fungicide spraying is
not needed for the control of leaf scald
and false smut. Use 500 litres of water for
high volume spraying and 200 litres for low
volume spraying. It is advisable to use
different fungicies recommended on a
rotational basis than using the same
fungicide continuously.
Rice glume discolouration disease:
Spraying commercially available carbendazim
12% + mancozeb 63% @ 750g ha-1 is  effective
in controlling Glume discolouration disease in
rice at the time of panicle emergence.
Leaf blight symptom start as water soaked
lesions on the tip of the leaves and increases
in length downwards along the margins. lnitially
the lesions are pale green in colour and later
turn into yellow to straw coloured stripes with
wavy margins. Occasionally the linear lesions
may develop any where on the leaf lamina or
along the midrib with or without marginal
stripes. Lesions may cover the entire leaf
blade. The bacterial blight disease can be
confirmed by ooze test. Cut the affected plants
at the base and dip it in a glass of water and
hold it against the light for few minutes without
shaking. From the cut ends white milky
bacterial ooze will come out as streams.
Bacterial leaf streak
(Xanthomonas oryzae p v. oryzicola)
Narrow brownish yellow translucent
interveinal lines joining to form large dirty white
patches.
Note :
1. Spray fresh cowdung extract for the control
of bacterial blight. Dissolve 20 g cowdung
in one litre of water; allow to settle and
sieve. Use supernatant liquid.
2. Application of bleaching powder @ 5 kg
ha-1 in the irrigation water is recommended
for preventing the spread of bacterial leaf
blight particularly in the kresek stage.
3. Before application of antibiotics for the
control of bacterial blight, confirm the
disease by observing the bacterial ooze.
4. For control of sheath blight and sheath rot
the following prophylactic measures may
be adopted.

and low cost technique for N diagnosis
of current crop and N topdressing in rice.
The uppermost fully opened leaf of the
primary tiller has to be taken for
observation. Ten hills are selected at
random for an area of 400 sqm and thus
10 leaves form the sample size. The leaf
colour is compared with LCC and the
readings are taken. The average of 10
readings gives the LCC value of the plot.
Observation is taken at 10 days interval
from 20 days after transplanting or 25
days after sowing upto heading. If the
threshold value is less than 4, N@ 25-30
kg/ha is recommended for  application.
If the inherent soil N is low, basal N @
25-30 kg ha-1 is to be applied.
10.
When the amount of available N is limited,
apply it 7 days before panicle initiation.
This is the best time for top dressing N.
Hints for reducing cost of cultivation
1.
Grow a green manure crop like daincha
in April-May in areas where the virippu
crop is usually transplanted.
2.
If Azolla is available, this may be applied
instead of green leaf or FYM at 5t ha-1.
3.
Puddle and level the field thoroughly. This
will help to reduce the cost of weed
control and also the loss of water and
nutrients through percolation.
4.
Maintain optimum plant density per unit
area, i.e., 50 hills/m2 for medium duration
varieties and 67 hills/m2 for early duration
varieties.
5.
Plant the seedlings shallow (3-4.5 cm),
as shallow planting increases the tillering
of seedlings.
6.
Control the weeds during the vegetative
phase itself. One weeding thoroughly on
the 30th day after sowing is ideal. Use
herbicides for weed control, wherever it
is cheaper than hand weeding.
7.
Under good management practices (vide
item 1-6) reduce the dose of fertilizer N
to half the present recommended level.
Apply the fertilizer when the plant is able
D. Biocontrol
 Use biocontrol agents, Trichoderma viride and   Pseudomonas   fluorescens  for the management of
sheath blight of rice.
Prophylactic application of  talc based formulation of Trichoderma viride  as  - Seed treatment
(10 g kg-1 seed) +  Soil application (2.5 kg ha-1 ) one week after transplanting  + Foliar spray (10g l-1)
after one month is effective for the management of sheath blight  for upland rice.
Prophylactic  application of  talc based formulation Pseudomonas fluorescens  as  - Seed treatment
(10 g kg-1 seed)  +  Soil application (2.5 kg ha-1) one week after transplanting  + Foliar spray (10g l-1) one
month after transplanting is effective for the management of blast, sheath blight, brown spot,  sheath
rot, glume discolouration  and bacterial blight of rice.
E. Bio Pesticides for Sheath blight control :
Spray Neem formulations Azadirachtin 0.15 per cent WSP@ 2.5 l ha-1 or Azadirachtin 0.03 per cent EC
@ 2.5 l ha -1 at the time of Sheath blight disease occurrence
36
RICE
11.
Adopt agronomic practices for increasing
fertilizer use efficiency such as: (a)
Incorporating ammoniacal N in the
reduced zone in the soil (b) Incubating
urea with moist soil (1:6) for 24 hours
(c) Blending urea with neem cake.
12.
Choose fertilizer materials, which are
cheaper, e.g. urea is cheaper than
ammonium sulphate; rock phosphate is
cheaper than superphosphate.
13.
Apply phosphatic and potash fertilizers
once in two seasons in areas where there
is no marked response for these
nutrients.
14.
Adopt integrated pest management
against insect pests and diseases.
15.
Harvest the crop at optimum moisture
content in order to avoid loss due to
shedding and also for improving the
recovery of rice.
Mechanical Transplanting in Rice
A. Mat Nursery Preparation
1.
Use very thin polythene sheet.
2.
Select nursery area near to the main field
3.
Cow dung powder may be incorporated
@ one third volume of the puddled soil
and spread over the sheet at a thickness
of 10-15 mm.
4.
The sheet may be spread after leveling
the nursery area.
5.
Form small bunds along the boundaries
of the polythene sheet, after spreading it,
to impound water.
6.
Mat nursery may be of 900mm width and
convenient length.
7.
Just sprouted seeds (4th  day of soaking)
may be uniformly spread over the mat
area @ 0.4 to 0.6kg m-2.
8.
Seedbed may be mulched, preferably
using green leaves.
9.
Sprinkle water over the seedbed for four
days twice daily and keep soil in saturated
condition.  Never allow mat to dry up.
10.
On 4th  day remove the mulch and keep
standing water to a height of 3/4th of
seedling height.  Keep this condition till
the end of nursery period.
11.
Closely observe the nursery for pest and
disease attack and adopt control
measures, if required.
12.
When seedlings reach a height of
150 mm, mat is ready for transplanting.
13.
Drain the required mat area 6-12 hours
before cutting for feeding into the
transplanter trays.
14.
Cut the mat strips 225 mm wide and
450 mm long to match the measurements
of the transplanter trays.
15.
Do not allow nursery to over grow.  Over
growing will lead to entanglement of
seedlings with fingers of transplanter and
clogging of fingers due to thick and hard
mat of roots.
B. Main field
1.
Prepare the main field adequately,
without clods and stubbles interfering with
functioning of finger.
2.
Prepare main field sufficiently early to
avoid floating of puddle while transplanter
is working.
3.
Final preparation may be done on the day
of transplanting in case of sandy loam
soil, but may be done 3-4 days prior to
planting in case of clayey soils, depending
upon settling time of the puddle to
consolidate.
37
RICE
4.
A thin film of water only is needed in the
main field at the time of transplanting.
(Too much water in the field will lead to
floating of seedlings and too dry condition
to non-anchoring of seedlings).
5.
Main field should have irrigation and
drainage facility.
6.
Wetting of mat may be required while
transplanter is in operation.
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in
rice
The indiscriminate use of pesticides for pest
control has led to disturbances in natural
ecosystem leading to resurgence of pests,
secondary pests outbreak, toxic hazards and
residues besides environmental pollution.
This has led to major emphasis on Integrated
Pest Management and gained greater
momentum. Integrated Pest Management
programmes promote favourable, ecological,
economic and sociological outcome, which is
accomplished by the best mix of pest control
tactics. The use of appropriate scouting tactics,
proper diagnosis of pest, the use of economic
thresholds and conservation of naturally
occurring biocontrol agents are fundamental
components of a sound Integrated Pest
Management programme. The use of chemical
is restricted. It is used only if it is absolutely
essential based on surveillance. The important
components in the IPM are the use of tolerant/
resistant varieties, regulating planting density,
adjusting the time of planting / sowing, group
farming practices, cultural management of
pests, integrated nutrient management,
removal of weeds, use of botanical pesticides
and preservation of natural enemies. A list of
common natural enemies of rice pests is given
as Table 12. For the preservation of natural
enemies, collect the egg masses of pests in
perforated polythene bags and keep them in
the field so that the parasites that emerge can
establish in the field effectively.
IPM Package:
•
Seedling treatment with Pseudomonas
florescens
•
Nursery drenching with cartap hydro-
chloride @ 1kg a.i./ha
•
Plant at a spacing of 20 x 15cms
•
Provision of alleyways at every 3m rows
•
Mass trapping with pheromone traps @
8 traps/acre for yellow stem borer
•
Release of egg parasitoids Tricho-
gramma japonicum for stem borer and
T.chilonis for leaf folder
•
Spray with azadirachtin1% at 15, 30, 45
and 60 DAT
Trichogramma chilonis and Tricho-
gramma japonicum are egg parasitoids which
effectively control egg mass of leaf roller, stem
borer, skippers and cutworms.  The parasitoids
have to be released 15-30 days after
transplantation or 25-30 days after sowing or
immediately after noticing moth activity in the
field.  The release rate is 1 lakh parasitoids/ha
of both size (5cc ha-1).  The release has to be
carried out at weekly intervals.  The trichocard
have to be cut into small pieces (minimum 10
pieces) and released in main field,  6-8 releases
is necessary to control the pest.
Precaution : If larval attack is observed in
the field, necessary organic/inorganic
insecticides have to be used and a gap of
7 days has to be given before next release.
The trichocards have to be placed during early
morning or late evening hours and should not
come in direct contact with sunlight.

C. Birds
a. Install artificial nesting sites viz., wooden
nest boxes in the rice fields (@ 12 nests
ha-1) for colonization by cavity nesting birds
(magpie robin, common myna, barn owl,
etc.) which play a vital role in managing a
variety of insect and non-insect pests. The
nest boxes should be installed at a height
more than 8 feet on wooden pole, tree
trunk, etc.
b. Installation of bird perches @ 50 ha-1
increases the activity of insectivorous birds
and reduces the pest population in rice
fields. The perches should have a minimum
height of 75 cm above the crop canopy for
better visibility for the birds.
c. Tying metalised reflective ribbon @
20 - 25 rolls ha-1 at 75 cm above the canopy
of the vulnerable stage of the crop on
bamboo poles, 2.5 – 3.0 m apart at
convenient length, twisted at every 1 m
length scares away the depredatory birds.
Effective and eco-friendly pest manage-
ment in wet land rice ecosystem
1. Cultivate tolerant varieties.
2. Monitor the field at least at weekly
intervals.
3. Pest and natural enemy population should
be monitored for deciding spraying
schedule.
4. Spraying should be avoided during the
reproductive phase.
5. Spot application of insecticide may
be adopted in heavily infested
pockets to control further spread
of the pest and to conserve the existing
natural enemy population in rice
ecosystem.

Multi species integration in rice
Multi species integration is recommended
in Kuttanad wetlands to the tune of 10000
fishes, 750 broiler ducks and 3-5 male
buffaloes/annum/ha. Rice season is June-
October. Fish fingerlings are stocked
simultaneously in nursery ponds dug nearby.
Fish species composition of grass carp, rohu
and mrigal at 2:1:1 @10000 per ha. Broiler
ducklings  variety Vigoa @ 125-150/ha  are
grown in duck houses erected over the fish
pond simultaneously. Ducklings are fed with
formulated feed. Spilled over feed and
excrements of duck fertilize the fish ponds.
The ducklings are grown for 45-50 days and
attain 2.5 - 3 kg. On an annuity basis 5-8
batches of broiler ducks can be reared. Duck
excrements to the tune of 9-10 tons are
recycled in this way. Paddy harvest will be
over in 120-125 days. Paddy fields are
inundated after rice harvest and fishes are
released to the expanded water body. The left
over paddy straw on decomposition generate
abundant food material in addition to the duck
manure flowing down from the nursery pond.
The fish species composition of grass carp and
cyprinus is capable of feeding aquatic weeds
and detritus straw. The field bottoms are tilled
during foraging. The fishes are harvested prior
to the next paddy season. Rice fields require
no land preparation and preliminary weeding
if the plant stand establishment is taken up
within one week after the fish harvest. The
paddy straw and wild grass available is
sufficient to grow 3-5 male buffaloes for meat
purpose. This farming system is capable to
produce 6-8 tons of paddy grain, 1.8 to 2.25
tons of broiler duck, 2.5 to 3 tons of fish and
450 to 500 kg beef meat/ha/annum. Other major
rice cropping systems of Kerala are included
as Table 13.

MAIZE (Zea mays)
Maize can be grown throughout the year
at altitude ranging from sea level to about 300 m.
Maize grows best in areas with rainfall of 600-
900 mm. It requires fertile, well-drained soil
with a pH ranging from 5.5-8.0, but pH 6.0-
7.0 is optimum.
Season
As a rainfed crop, maize is grown in
June-July or August-September. The irrigated
crop is raised in January-February.
Varieties
Hybrids: Ganga Hybrid-1, Ganga Hybrid-
101, Deccan hybrid, Renjit, Hi-Starch.
Composite varieties: Kissan Composite,
Amber, Vijay, Vikram, Sona, Jawahar.
Seeds and sowing
Seed rate: 20 kg ha-1
Plough the land three times and prepare
ridges and furrows. Dibble one seed per hole
at a spacing of 60 cm x 23 cm for the rainy
season crop. For irrigated crop, beds are
prepared. Here, seeds are sown in lines and
earthed up later in to small ridges to form fur-
rows when the crop reaches knee height.
Manuring
Apply FYM/compost @ 25 t ha-1 at the
time of preparation of land. The recommended
fertilizer dose is 135 kg nitrogen, 65 kg phos-
phorus and 15 kg  potash  per ha.
  Apply full
dose of phosphorus and potash and 1/3 dose
of nitrogen as basal. Apply 1/3 nitrogen,
30-40 days and the rest 60-70 days after
sowing.
After cultivation
Hand hoeing and weeding on the 21st and
45th day after sowing.
Irrigation
Irrigate the crop on the day of sowing and
on third day. Subsequent irrigations may be
given at 10-15 days intervals.
SORGHUM (Sorghum bicolor)
Sorghum is a plant of hot and warm
localities. The optimum temperature for growth
is 30oC and it needs about 250-400 mm rainfall.

RAGI (Eleusine coracana)
Ragi is suited for cultivation in areas with
annual rainfall of 700-1200 mm. It does not
tolerate heavy rainfall and requires a dry spell
at the time of grain ripening. It grows well in
altitudes of 1000-2000 m with average tem-
perature of 27ºC. Ragi is cultivated mostly in
red lateritic soils. Relatively fertile and well
drained soils are the most suitable.
Seasons
Ragi is not a season bound crop and hence
can be cultivated throughout the year, if mois-
ture is available. It is usually grown
during the following seasons.
Main season : June-September
Late season
: July-October
Summer
: Dec-Jan to March-April
Varieties
PR-202, K-2, Co-2, Co-7, Co-8, Co-9, Co-10.

Incorporate FYM/compost 5 t ha-1 and
form beds and channels. Sow seeds
uniformly on the beds and cover by stirring the
soil. Apply carbaryl 10 per cent on the edges
of the beds against ants. One week before
uprooting seedlings, apply ammonium sulphate
@ of 1 kg per 100 m2. A nursery area of 480
m2 is necessary to raise seedlings for one hect-
are. Transplant the seedlings when they are
three weeks old.
Manuring
Plough the field 3-4 times and incorporate
FYM or compost 5 t ha-1. Apply nitrogen, phos-
phorus and potash @ 22.5 kg ha-1 each

or planting.
After cultivation
Weeding should be done three weeks
after sowing and completed before top
dressing.
Irrigation
Irrigate the field on the day of trans-
plantation. Irrigation at weekly intervals
increases growth rate and yield.
Plant protection
The pink stem borer, which causes dead
heart symptoms, is often serious in the early
stages of the crop. Insecticidal control is not
needed for mild to moderate levels of infesta-
tion.
For controlling blast, spray mancozeb
750-1000 g ha

followed by two sprays of thiourea (one at
vegetative and another at flowering stage)
increased the yield of cowpea by
26 per cent and net return by 50 per cent.
Seed inoculation and pelleting
Cowpea seeds should be inoculated with
Rhizobium and pelleted with lime. Rhizobium
cultures are available from the Assistant Soil
Chemist, Microbiological Laboratory, Soil
Testing Centre, Pattambi 679 306, Palakkad
District. The strains that are available at
Pattambi are the two isolates (No.11 and
No.12) developed by the Kerala Agricultural
University.
Procedure for seed inoculation
The content of each packet of Rhizobium
inoculant is sufficient for seeds to be sown in
the area indicated on the packet (250 to 375 g
ha-1). Use the inoculant only for the specific
leguminous crop mentioned on the packet,
before the expiry date. Do not expose the
Rhizobium culture to direct sunlight or heat.
Mix the inoculant uniformly with the seeds by
using minimum quantity of water (instead of
water, either 2.5 per cent starch solution or
kanjivellam of the previous day can be used
in order to ensure better stickiness of the
inoculant with the treated seed material). Take
care to avoid any damage to the seed coat.
Dry the inoculated seeds under shade over a
clean paper or gunny bag and sow immediately.
The Rhizobium culture or the inoculated seeds
should not be mixed with chemical fertilizers.
Procedure for lime pelleting
1. Add finely powdered (300 mesh) calcium
carbonate to moist fresh Rhizobium treated
seeds and mix for 1-3 minutes until each
seed is uniformly pelleted. Depending on
the seed size, the following quantity of lime
as required.
Small seeds              1.0 kg/10 kg of seed
Medium sized seeds  0.6 kg/10 kg of seed
Large sized seeds     0.5 kg/10 kg of seed

COWPEA
2. Spread out the pelleted seeds on a clean
paper to harden. Sow them as soon as
possible. However, lime pelleted seeds can
be stored up to one week in a cool place
prior to sowing.
Note:
1. Lime coating is required only for seeds that
are to be sown in acid soils.
2. Ordinary agricultural lime is not good for
pelleting because of its larger particle size.
Good quality high grade lime should be used.
3. Hydrated lime should not be used for
pelleting.
4. The dry pellet should be firm enough to
resist moderate pressure. It should appear
dry without loose lime on its surface or in
the container.
5. The lime-pelleted seeds can be mixed with
the fertilizer and sown. However, the period
of contact between fertilizer and the
pelleted seeds should be as short as
possible.
6. Pelleted seeds should not be sown into a
dry seedbed.
Weed management : Pre-emergence
application (0-3 days after sowing) of
Pretilachlor @ 0.75 kg a.i./ha recommended
to control grasses, sedges and broad leaved
weeds in cowpea.
Spacing
For grain type and dual-purpose type, if
dibbling is adopted, spacing of 25 cm between
rows and 15 cm between plants is
recommended with two seeds per hole. For
bush vegetable type, spacing of 30 cm between
rows and 15 cm between plants is suitable.
For semi-trailing varieties, provide a spacing
of 45 x 30 cm. Trailing varieties can be sown
in pits (@ 3 plants/pit) at 2 x 2 m spacing for
trailing on pandal or in channels at 1.5 m x 45 cm
spacing for trailing on trellis. If broadcasting
is adopted, the seeds can be sown broadcast
over the field and channels drawn after sowing.
Sowing
Plough the land thoroughly 2-3 times and
remove weeds and stubbles. Make channels
of 30 cm breadth and 15 cm depth at 2 m apart
to drain off excess rainwater.
Manuring
FYM      20 t ha-1
Lime 250 kg ha-1(or dolomite 400 kg ha-1)
N           20 kg ha-1
P2O5       30 kg ha-1
K2O        10 kg ha-1
Lime may be applied at the time of the first
ploughing. Half the quantity of nitrogen, whole
of phosphorus and potash may be applied at
the time of final ploughing. The remaining
nitrogen may be applied 15-20 days after
sowing.
[Note: For vegetable cowpea grown as an
intercrop in the reclaimed alluvial soils of
Kuttanad, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash at
the rate of 10, 20 and 10 kg ha-1 are
recommended. For vegetable cowpea,
fertilizers can be applied in several split doses
at fortnightly intervals.]
After cultivation
Hoeing at the time of application of the
second dose of nitrogen will give adequate
aeration to the soil and help the root system to
spread easily. For grain and dual-purpose
varieties, decapitation is found to be
advantageous as the crop shows trailing
tendency. For vegetable types, provide trellis
or pandal for trailing.

The root-knot nematode and reniform
nematode associated with cowpea can be
effectively managed by the application of neem
and eupatorium leaves @ 15 t ha-1, two weeks
before sowing.
Spray 1per cent Bordeaux mixture in early
stages to protect the crop from fungal diseases.
Anthracnose of cowpea
(Colletotrichum lindemuthianum)
Causes water soaked lesions on leaves,
which later become brown and enlarge to form
circular spots.  The infection may  spread to
the petiole and young stem also.  Petiole
infection results in defoliation.  For protecting
the crop from anthracnose, treat the seeds with
carbendazim (0.05 per cent) and spray the crop

doses on the 15th and 30th day after sowing.
Green pea can be successfully grown in
altitudes above 1000 m in the cool season.
Well-drained loamy and laterite soils are
suitable.
Season
The crop is sown in October-November
after abatement of the southwest monsoon
showers. Crops sown beyond January will not
give satisfactory result.
Varieties
Bonnevilla, Markserbsen (These are short
duration varieties with long green pods each
containing 7-8 kernels; suitable for canning).
GREEN PEA (Pisum sativum)
Seeds and sowing
Adopt seed rate of 60 kg/ha and spacing
of 15-20 cm between rows and 10 cm between
plants. Place the seeds at a depth of 2 to 2.5 cm.
Line sowing is helpful for training the vines on
standards.
Land Preparation
The land should be prepared thoroughly by
ploughing, digging and removing all stems,
stubbles, etc. For early-sown crop, raised beds
of 1 m width and 5 cm height may be prepared
for sowing the seeds. If irrigation is necessary,
provide furrows between rows for guiding
water.

RED GRAM (Cajanus cajan)
Red gram (Pigeon pea) is suitable for the
tropics. The most favourable temperature
range is 18-30ºC. The crop is grown at a wide
range of elevation. Red gram can be grown in
almost all soil types that are not very poor in
lime and are not subjected to waterlogging.
Optimum growth and yield are obtained in deep
loam soils. Red gram can be grown as mixed
crop with groundnut, paddy or tapioca or as a
pure crop.
Season
Sowing can be done in two seasons. As a
mixed crop, sow the seeds in June-July. Red
Manuring
Apply FYM or compost @ 20 t ha-1 and
N:P2O5:K2O @ 30:40:60 kg ha-1 as basal
dressing. In soils of medium fertility, top
dressing of nitrogen @ 30 kg ha-1 four weeks
after sowing is essential.
After cultivation
Weed the plots four weeks after sowing
and 50 days later. Provide support for training
the vines. Pods can be harvested when the
grains are fully developed. In short duration
varieties, harvesting will be over within
100-120 days while long duration varieties will
normally take 140-160 days.
Plant protection
Soak the seeds before sowing in a copper-
based fungicide solution. Spray malathion
0.1 per cent suspension at 15-20 days interval
for the control of aphids. Stop application of
chemicals 10 days before harvesting. Powdery
mildew can be controlled by spraying
thiophanate methyl 0.05 per cent. For control
of downy mildew, spray any of the copper
fungicides at a concentration of 0.2 to 0.3 per
cent.

Plant protection
Pod borer is the main pest. For controlling
this, spray the crop with 0.05 per cent
quinalphos suspension at the time of flowering.
The blister beetle, Zonabris, gregariously feeds
on the flowers.
SOYBEAN (Glycine max)
Soybean is grown, mainly in areas where
the summer is hot and humid. However, it does
not withstand extreme summer and winter. The
optimum temperature for growing soybean is
25-30ºC. Well-drained sandy or clay loams and
alluviums with good fertility are generally
suitable for the cultivation of the crop. When
taking up cultivation in a new area, inoculation
with the culture of Rhizobium is desirable.
Season
The crop will perform best when sown by
the onset of south-west monsoon. Sowing after
the onset of heavy showers will result in poor
germination and growth. Though it can be
grown in other seasons under irrigation, its
performance will be poor. If flowering
coincides with rainy season, fruit set will be
adversely affected.
Varieties
Bragg, JN-2750, EC-2661
These varieties have duration of about
4 months when sown in May-June. The
duration will be less in other seasons.
Seeds and sowing
 Seeds may be sown either in lines 45 cm
apart at a distance of 10 cm between seeds in
a row or by giving a plant-to-plant distance of
20 cm.
Land Preparation
As waterlogging will affect germination
and growth of the crop, it may be sown in raised
beds during rainy season.
Manuring
Apply fertilizers to provide N:P2O5:K2O @
20:30:10 kg ha-1. The fertilizers may be applied
basally. In soils of low fertility, application of
organic manures is beneficial.
After cultivation
Weed the plots once or twice depending
on weed growth. As the crop smothers the
field after initial growth, weed control will be
necessary only up to 30-40 days after sowing.
Earthing up at the time of weeding is beneficial.
Plant protection
The crop is free from infestation of major
pests. The minor pests include stem fly
(Melanagromyza sp.) and leaf roller
(Lamrosema sp.). The stem fly mines into stem
and the plant withers and dries up. Damage is
more serious in young plants. The leaf miner
causes pale brown patches along the lamina.
The flower thrip feeds within flowers and
prevents seed formation.
51
RED GRAM AND SOYBEAN
Collar rot
The diseases include collar rot
(Rhizoctonia solani) which causes water
soaked lesions at the collar region which later
spread along the whole stem. The plant
succumbs in a few days. The disease occurs
in patches under high soil moisture and high
organic matter levels. To control the disease,
provide good drainage (Refer cowpea).
Anthracnose
Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum
lindemuthianum is also common. The fungus
causes dark brown elongated, more or less
angular spots along the veins on the petioles,
stem and lamina. When infection occurs on
the hypocotyl, the plant collapses. Seeds when
infected turn brown or black. To control the
disease, select seeds from disease free plots
(Refer cowpea).
Mosaic disease
The spread of mosaic disease, characte-
rized by mottling, curling and distortion of leaves
and malformations of the pod is checked by
rouging out the infected plant and spraying
dimethoate 0.05 per cent to control the insect
vectors.
Pod blight
The pod blight (Diaporthe phaseolorum)
causes irregular spots with discoloured border
on the leaves and pods. Crop rotations,
destruction of diseased plants and prophylactic
foliar application of  mancozeb 0.3 per cent
are recommended to control the disease.
Harvesting and yield
The crop will be ready for harvest in about
4 months after sowing. Yellowing of leaves
and their shedding are signs of maturity. If the
period of maturity is rain free, the crop may
be left in the field for about a week after
complete leaf shedding. If the period is rainy,
the crop may be harvested after leaf shedding
and the produce may then be dried in shade
for about 10 days. After drying, seeds may be
separated by beating with stick. Soybean
seeds lose viability after about a year. By
drying the seeds to moisture content less than
10 per cent, reasonable viability can be
maintained up to one year. If it is not for sowing,
the seed may be stored for up to three years
after drying.
Value addition
The bulk of the soybean is processed
industrially into oil and protein. It may also be
used as a pulse for direct consumption after
cooking. It can be substituted for black gram
and other pulses in the common household
preparations. The soybean preparations will
have the characteristic soyodour, which can
be eliminated by treatment. Soybean may also
be used for making soymilk, soymilk shake,
etc.
Preparation of soybean milk
Mature dry beans are washed thoroughly
and soaked in water for 8-10 hours. Remove
the husk (testa) by gently pressing the soaked
seeds. Wash thoroughly and grind to a thick
paste. Alternatively, the beans may be steamed
and ground. Add water 6-8 times the volume
of seeds and bring to boil. Strain through muslin
cloth. Boil once again under gentle stirring. This
milk can be kept for 5 days in refrigerator.
Periodic boiling will increase the storage life
of soymilk.
Soybean has a characteristic “bean flavour”
which is not relished by many. The
acceptability of the soymilk can be improved
by removal of the “bean flavour”. For this, soak
soybean in 5 per cent starch solution preheated
to 80ºC for 8-12 hours. The starch solution
drained from cooked rice (kanjivellam) can
be used for this purpose. Soaking the beans
for half an hour in hot starch water and then
repeated washing with cold water is required.

 SOYBEAN
TUBERS
ELEPHANT FOOT YAM (Amorphophallus paeoniifolius)
Elephant foot yam requires fairly long
growing season and a rainfall of about 150 cm
during the crop period. A well-drained soil of
medium texture is suited for this crop.
Season
Corm pieces are normally planted during
February-March, before the onset of
monsoon.
Varieties
Sree Padma : The crop matures in 8-9 months.
Cooked tubers are free from acridity.
Sree Athira : First genetically improved variety
with very good cooking quality.
Seeds and sowing
Tuber cut-pieces having a portion of central
bud and weighing about 1 kg are ideal for
planting. Dip the pieces in cowdung slurry and
allow to dry under shade before planting.
Nematodes associated with amorphophallus
can be controlled by seed material treatment
with talc based formulation of Bacillus
macerans @ 3g (106 cfu/g) per kg of corms.
After planting, cover the pit with dried leaves
or other mulching materials. About 12,000 cut
pieces weighing about 12 t are required for
planting one hectare. Most of the seed material
will germinate within one month after planting.
Mealy bugs usually attack the corm in field
and store. Avoid planting corms already
infested.
Land Preparation
Dig pits of 60 cm x 60 cm x 45 cm size
90 cm apart. Collect the topsoil to a depth of
15-20 cm separately and fill it after the pits
are formed. Apply cowdung or compost at
2-2.5 kg/pit and mix with topsoil.
Minisett technique for quality planting
materials
Minisetts weighing 100 g each can be planted
directly in nursery beds or in the main field with
the central bud portion facing up at a spacing
of 60 cm x 45 cm. A total of 37,000 minisetts/
ha is required as against 12,345 setts/ha in  the
traditional method. Multiplication ratio in
elephant foot yam could be enhanced to 1:15
as against the conventional 1:3 by adopting
minisett technique.
After cultivation
Apply full dose of P2O5 and half the dose
N and K2O (N:P2O5:K2O @ 50:50:75 kg ha-1)
after forty five days of planting along with
intercultivation and weeding. Apply second
dose of fertilizers (N and K2O @ 50:75 kg
ha-1) one month after the first application
along with intercultivation and earthing up.
Harvesting
The crop will be ready for harvest 8-9
months after planting.

Recommendation
•
Raising green manure cowpea (seed rate
@ 20 kg ha-1) prior to elephant foot yam
and incorporation of green matter at
45-60 days.
•
Use of organically produced planting
materials.
•
Treatment of corm pieces of 500-750 g

ELEPHANT FOOE YAM
Tannia is suited to warm humid climate with
high rainfall. But can be grown in areas of
100-200 cm rainfall, provided it is evenly
distributed. It is usually grown from sea level
up to 1350-1500 m over a wide range of
temperature (13 to 29oC). It is less tolerant to
drought but cannot withstand water logging.
This crop can tolerate light shade but the aerial
part dies down with increasing shade. It can
be grown on a wide variety of soils except
hard clay or pure sands, but requires  a deep
well drained, fertile loamy soil, preferably with
a pH of 5.5 to 6.5 with a mean soil temperature
above 20oC. It can be grown as pure crop as
well as intercrop in coconut, banana, rubber
and other plantations.
Season
Rainfed crop : February- March to
November-December.
Irrigated crop : Throughout the year.
Varieties

within 190-210 days, the cooking quality of the
cormels is good and the  leaves are edible.
But local selections having tubers with low
acridity, good texture and leaves with vegetable
use are also available.
Seeds and sowing
Healthy cormels of 50-100 g weight and
20-25 cm long and cut corms of 150-200 g
size are commonly used. For planting one
hectare, 1.8-2.5 tons of corms or 0.6-1.0 ton
of cormels are required. Usually seed
materials are planted 6-7 cm deep. While
planting the cut pieces of the main corm or
suckers, it is advisable to keep the apical
portion above the ground level.
Land preparation
The land is usually made to a fine tilth and
ploughed to a depth of 20-40 cm followed by
the formation of ridges and furrows especially
in heavy textured soils. Planting on ridges or
mounds is often recommended since tuber
formation is improved when adequate drainage
is provided. A spacing of 90 X 90 cm is usually
practiced with a planting density of 12,345

twice at 1 and 2 months after planting. In some
areas, earthing up three times along with
weeding and fertilizer application is
recommended. When crop is grown in kitchen
garden without applying any fertilizer, weeding
is done especially at the early stage of plant
growth. Lower leaves and petioles should be
removed when they start drying.
Mulching
As the crop respond well to mulching, after
planting, green leaf mulching @15 tons per ha
was found beneficial for maximum corm as
well as cormel production.
Irrigation
During summer and drought periods, it is
essential to give 5-6 shallow irrigations to
maintain soil moisture. Maintenance of
adequate soil moisture, proper shade to sustain
a humid microclimate and avoiding full
exposure to sunlight is a must for good crop
growth, better tuber and leaf yield.
Plant protection
Dasheen mosaic virus was found to a small
extent. Use of disease free planting materials
can avoid the incidence of this problem. Usually
it was manifested as a secondary infection
when nutritional disorders in the form of Mg
deficiency became severe in the crop.
Nutritional disorders
When the crop is grown in laterite soils of
Kerala, interveinal chlorosis of the lower
leaves characteristic to Mg deficiency was
prevalent from 3rd month of growth causing
complete devastation of crop. As tannia is
identified as an indicator plant for Mg
deficiency, application of dolomite @ 1 ton per
ha during land preparation is advocated to
prevent the problem in these soils.
Harvesting
Crop can be harvested when older leaves
start yellowing and drying usually during
9-11 months of planting. As the corms and
cormels do not deteriorate if left un harvested,
harvesting can be done from 6 months till
10-12 months. If mature cormels are not
harvested, most of them will sprout at rain,
become watery and less suitable for
consumption.
Storage of seed material
After harvesting, curing of the corms and
cormels is done under sunlight for 4-5 days.
They can also be stored by embedding in dry
soil or sand for a period of 4-5 months under
ventilated, dry and semi dark conditions. Care
should be taken to avoid injury to the corms
and cormels while harvesting.

XANTHOSOMA
COLOCASIA [TARO] (Colocasia esculenta)
Colocasia is a crop of tropical and
sub-tropical regions and requires a warm
humid climate. Under rainfed conditions, it
requires a fairly well distributed rainfall around
120-150 cm during the growth period. Well-
drained soil is suitable for uniform development
of tubers.
Season
Rainfed crop : May-June to Oct-Nov.
Irrigated crop : Throughout the year
Varieties
Sree Rashmi, Sree Pallavi and Sreekiran
are three improved varieties.
Sree Rashmi -Economic yield under low input
levels, conical cormets and 7
months duration.
Sree Pallavi - Field tolerant to leaf blight and
mosaic, club shape cormets
and 7 months duration.
Sreekiran
- First hybrid taro variety in
India, long keeping quality of
cormets and 61/2 - 7 months
duration.
Seeds and sowing
Use side tubers each of 25-35 g for planting.
About 37,000 side tubers weighing about
1200 kg are required to plant one hectare.
Land preparation
Plough or dig the land to a depth of
20-25 cm and bring to a fine tilth. Make ridges
60 cm apart. Plant the side corms at a spacing
of 45 cm on the ridges.
Mulching
Soon after planting, cover the ridges with
suitable mulching materials for retention of
moisture and to control weeds.
Manuring
Apply cattle manure or compost @ 12
t ha-1 as basal dressing, while preparing the
ridges for planting. A nutrient dose of 80:25:100
kg of N:P2O5:K2O ha-1 is recommended. Full
dose of P2O5 and half dose of N and K2O
should be applied within a week after sprouting
and the remaining half dose of N and K2O
one month after the first application along with
weeding and earthing up.
After cultivation
Inter-cultivation is essential in colocasia.
Weeding, light hoeing and earthing up are
required at 30-45 days and 60-75 days after
planting. The leafy parts may be smothered
about one month before harvest so as to
enhance tuber development.
Irrigation
Ensure sufficient moisture in the soil at the
time of planting. For uniform sprouting, irrigate
just after planting and one week later.
Subsequent irrigation may be given at
12-15 days intervals, depending on the moisture
retention capacity of the soil. The irrigation
should be stopped 3-4 weeks before harvest.
About 9-12 irrigations are required for the crop
till harvest. In the case of rainfed crop, if there
is prolonged drought, supplementary irrigation
is required.
Plant protection
Colocasia blight can be controlled by
spraying mancozeb or copper oxychloride
formulations at 2 g l-1of water (1 kg ha-1). For
controlling serious infestation of aphids, spray
dimethoate at 0.05 per cent. Leaf feeders can
be controlled by spraying malathion 0.1%.
Harvesting
Colocasia becomes ready for harvest five
to six months after planting. The mother corms
and side tubers are separated after harvest.
COLOCASIA

Storage of seed material
The side tubers to be used as planting
materials are usually separated from the
mother corm and stored. Keep seed tuber in
sand spread over the floor to avoid rotting.
Organic Farming of Taro
Application of FYM @ 15 t ha-1 in pits at
the time of planting (400 g plant -1),  application

@ 15-20 t ha-1), and application of ash @ 2.0
t ha-1  at the time of incorporation of green
manure in pits (60 g plant-1).
DIOSCOREA (YAMS)
1. GREATER YAM (Dioscorea alata)
Greater yam is predominantly a tropical
plant. The crop cannot withstand frost and
excessively high temperatures. Temperature
around 30ºC and rainfall of 120-200 cm
distributed throughout the growth period are
ideal. Day length greater than 12 hours during
initial stages and shorter day length during the
later part of the growing season favour
satisfactory tuber formation. Yam requires
loose, deep, well-drained, fertile soil. The crop
does not come up well in waterlogged
conditions.
Season
Seed tubers are normally planted during the
later part of the dry season (March-April) and
start sprouting with the onset of pre-monsoon
showers. If the planting is delayed, yams start
sprouting in storage, which is not desirable for
planting.
Varieties
1. Sree Keerthi : Suitable for intercropping in
mature coconut garden and with banana.
2. Sree Roopa : Possesses excellent cooking
quality.
3. Indu : This is recommended as a pure crop
and also as an intercrop of coconut in the
reclaimed alluvial soils of Kuttanad.
4. Sree Shilpa : This is the first hybrid having
good culinary quality. The crop matures
early, within 8 months. The tubers have 33-
35 per cent dry matter, 17-19 per cent
starch, 1.4-2 per cent protein and
0.8-1.2 per cent sugar.
5. Sree Karthika : High yiled, excellent
cooking quality. The crop matures within 9
months. The tubers have 21.42 per cent
starch, 1.14 per cent sugar and 2.47 per
cent crude protein.
Seeds and sowing
D. alata produces mostly a single big tuber
in which only one head end of the tuber is
available as good seed material. For getting
the head end in each propagation unit, the
whole tuber is divided longitudinally. Each piece
of cut tuber should weigh at least
250-300 g. Dip the pieces in cowdung slurry
and allow to dry under the shade before
planting. About 2500-3000 kg of seed material
is required to cover one hectare of land.

COLOCASIA AND DIOSCOREA
DIOSCOREA AND LESSER YAM
58
Preparation of land
Plough or dig the land up to a depth of 15-
20 cm. Dig pits of size 45 x 45 x 45 cm at a
distance of 1 x 1 m. Fill up three fourth of the
pits with 1-1.25 kg cattle manure or compost
and mix with top soil. Plant the cut tuber pieces
and completely cover the pit with leafy
materials to conserve soil moisture and
maintain optimum temperature.
Manuring
Apply cattle manure or compost @ 10-15
t ha-1 as basal. An NPK dose of 80:60:80 kg
ha-1 has to be applied in two splits; half dose
of N, full P2O5 and half of K2O within a week
after sprouting; remaining half N and half K2O
one month after the first application along with
weeding and earthing up.
Trailing
Trailing is essential to expose the leaves to
sunlight. Trailing has to be done within
15 days after sprouting by coir rope attached
to artificial supports in the open areas or to
trees where they are raised as an intercrop.
When grown in open areas, trail to a height of
3-4 m. Trail the vines properly as and when
side shoots are produced.
Harvesting
The crop becomes ready for harvest within
8-9 months after planting when the vines are
completely dried up. Dig out the tubers without
causing injury.
2. LESSER YAM (Dioscorea esculenta)
It is grown in a similar agro-climatic
situation as that of D. alata. Planting season
and manuring are also similar.
Varieties
1.
Sree Latha : This is a selection from
Thiruvananthapuram district with a
duration of 8 months. Tubers are oblong
to fusiform with creamy white flesh. Vines
twine to the left.
2.
Sree Kala : This is an early variety
with 7.5 months duration. The tubers have
35-37 per cent dry matter, 23-25 per cent
starch and 1-1.3 per cent sugar.
Seeds and sowing
Select medium size tubers weighing about
100-150 g each. Plant the whole tuber, one in
each mound and cover completely with soil.
Mulch the mounds to maintain optimum
temperature and moisture. To plant one hectare
1800-2700 kg of seed materials are required.
Preparation of land
Plough or dig the land to a depth of
15-20 cm. Prepare mounds at a spacing of
75 cm x 75 cm incorporating cattle manure
@ 1 kg per mound.
Manuring
The nutrient dose and schedule of
application are the same as that of  D. alata.
Trailing
Trail the vines by fixing small poles attached
with coir rope and direct 4-6 plants per pole.
Harvesting
The crop is ready for harvest by about
7-8 months time. Tuber yields of 20-25 t ha-1
can be obtained by following the improved
methods of cultivation.

WHITE YAM AND SWEET POTATO
3. WHITE YAM (Dioscorea rotundata)
White yam or African yam is a new crop
species of edible yam introduced from
Nigeria.
Varieties
Sree Subhra: The tuber contains
27-28 per cent dry matter, 21-22 per cent
starch and 1.8-2 per cent protein. It is drought
tolerant with 9-10 months duration.
Sree Priya: The tuber contains 25-27 per
cent dry matter, 19-21 per cent starch and 2-
2.5 per cent protein. It is drought tolerant and
duration is 9-10 months. It is suitable for
inter-cropping in mature coconut garden and
with banana.
Sree Dhanya: It is the first dwarf variety.
The tubers have 28-30 per cent dry matter,
22-24 per cent protein and 0.3-0.5 per cent
sugar.
Manuring
FYM 15 t ha-1 to be applied at the time of
land preparation followed by application of
NPK fertilizers @ 100:50:100 kg ha-1. Full dose
of P fertilizer along with 50 per cent of
N and K fertilizers to be applied as basal when
50 per cent of the planted setts sprouts.
The balance 50 per cent of N and K fertilizers
to be applied as top dressing, 1 month after
the first application which could be combined
with intercultural operations. 
Rapid seed yam production (minisett
technique)
In this method clean and healthy yam
tubers weighing about 1 kg are cut into
cylindrical (disc-like) pieces, each about 5 cm
thick. From each such piece, 2-4 small pieces
(30 g) could be obtained by cutting the disc
longitudinally or along the two perpendicular
diameters. Such a piece is called a “minisett”.
The minisetts are then spread out under light
shade for an hour with cut surface facing up
before planting them in the nursery seed beds.
The minisett takes 2-3 weeks for sprouting.
At this stage, they are transplanted to the main
field at a spacing of 50 cm on ridges taken
1 m apart.

SWEET POTATO (Ipomoea batatas)
Sweet potato requires a warm humid
tropical climate with a mean temperature of
about 22ºC. Though sensitive to frost, it can
also be grown in the hills up to an altitude of
1500-1800 m as a summer crop. Under rainfed
conditions the crop requires a fairly well
distributed annual rainfall of 75-150 cm. Being
a photosensitive crop, sunny days and cool
Local varieties: Badrakali Chuvala,
Kottayam Chuvala, Chinavella, Chakaravalli,
Anakomban.
Seeds and sowing
Sweet potato is propagated by means of
vine cuttings. To obtain vine cutting, raise
nurseries from selected tubers using the
following method. 80 kg of medium sized
weevil free tubers (each of 125-150 g) are
required for planting in the primary nursery
area (100 m2 to plant one hectare).
Plant the tubers at a spacing of 30-45 cm
on ridges formed at 60 cm apart and replant in
secondary nursery of about 500 m2 area at a
spacing of 25 cm. Apply urea 15 days after
planting @ 1.5 kg/100 m2 in the primary
nursery. To ensure better plant growth in the
secondary nursery, 5 kg of urea has to be
applied in two split doses on 15th and 30th day
after planting. Vines obtained from the freshly
harvested crop are also planted in similar
nursery area to obtain sufficient planting
material. Cuttings obtained from the apical and
near apical portions of the vines are preferable
for planting in the main field. Storing of cut
sweet potato vines with intact leaves, in bundles
covered with banana leaves (dipped in water)
and kept under shade for two days prior to
planting is recommended. Irrigate the nursery
every alternate day during the first 10 days
and once in 10 days, thereafter. Vines will be
ready for planting on the 45th day.
In the main field, plant vine cutting of 20-
25 cm length on ridges 60 cm apart and at a
spacing of 15-20 cm between the vines. The
cuttings can also be planted on mounds taken
at a spacing of 75 cm x 75 cm. On the top of
each mound, 3-6 cuttings can be planted. Plant
the vine cuttings with the middle portion buried
deep in the soil and the two cut ends exposed
to the surface. Ensure sufficient moisture in
SWEET POTATO
60
nights are favourable for better tuber
development.
The crop can be grown on a variety of soils
having good drainage, but grows best in fertile
sandy loam soils. Heavy clayey and very light
sandy soils are not suitable for proper tuber
development.

}
the soil for early establishment of the cutting.
Provide adequate drainage and prevent water
logging.
Land preparation
Make the soil to a fine tilth by ploughing or
digging to a depth of 15-25 cm. Make ridges
25-35 cm high, 60 cm apart for planting vines.
Manuring
Apply cattle manure or compost @
10 t ha-1 at the time of preparation of ridges.
The recommended N:P2O5:K2O dosage for
sweet potato is 75:50:75 kg ha-1. For the
reclaimed alluvial soils of Kuttanad, the
recommendation is 50:25:50 kg ha-1. Apply N
in two equal split doses, the first at the time of
planting and the second 4-5 weeks after
planting. Apply full dose of P2O5 and K2O at
the planting time.
Irrigation
When grown as irrigated crop, provide
irrigation once in 2 days for a period of
10 days after planting and thereafter once in
7-10 days. Stop irrigation 3 weeks before
harvest. But one more irrigation may be given
2 days before harvest. IW / CPE for higher
tuber yield in non-rainy periods is 1.2
(approximate interval of 11 days). The
application of N and K2O @ 50 kg ha-1 is
recommended for the crop grown under
irrigation.
After cultivation
Conduct two weeding and earthing up
operations about 2 weeks and 5 weeks after
planting. The top dressing of fertilizers may
be done along with the second after cultivation.
Prevent development of small slender tubers
at the nodes by turning the vines occasionally
during active growth phase.
Rotation and mixed cropping
Under irrigated conditions, sweet potato
can be rotated with rice and planted during
December-January after harvest of the second
crop of rice. As a mixed crop, it can be grown
along with colocasia, elephant foot yam etc.
Under rainfed conditions, green manure crops
such as kozhinjil and sunnhemp can be grown
after harvest of the sweet potato and later
incorporated into the soil at the time of land
preparation for the succeeding crop.
Plant protection
Integrated control of sweet potato weevil
a) Remove and destroy the crop residues of
the previous crop.
b) Use healthy and weevil-free planting
materials.
c) Apply Chromolaena odorata leaves as
mulch @ 3 t ha-1 at 30 DAP.
d) Trap adult weevils using sweet potato pieces
(of about 6 cm diameter) of 100 g size, kept
at 5 m apart during 50 to 80 DAP at 10
days interval. Tubers may be cut and kept
inside wire cages to avoid rat damage.
e) Use pheromone traps (3Z dodecenyl 2E
butenoate).
Harvesting
The duration of the crop depends on the
variety; but in general, the crop can be
harvested in about 3.5 – 4 months after
planting. Harvest the crop when leaves begin
to turn yellow and the tubers mature.
The maturity of tuber can be ascertained
 by cutting fresh tubers. The cut surface will
dry clear if the tuber is mature and becomes
dark green if immature. Harvest the crop by
digging out the tubers without causing injury.

SWEET POTATO
TAPIOCA [CASSAVA] (Manihot esculenta)
Tapioca grows and produces best under
warm humid tropical conditions where rainfall
is well distributed and fairly abundant. It can
also be grown under irrigation where rainfall
is low. Its outstanding characteristic in terms
of moisture requirement is the ability to
withstand fairly prolonged periods of drought.
However, at the time of planting there must
be sufficient moisture for the plant to establish
itself. The crop cannot withstand cold and is
killed by frost.
The crop grows well in well-drained laterite,
gravelly and sandy loam soils. Heavy and rocky
soils are less suitable because they restrict root
development. The crop cannot survive
waterlogged conditions and in such areas, it
must be planted on mounds or ridges that
permit drainage. The crop can also be gown
on hill slopes with precautions and on
wastelands of low fertility.
Season
The main planting seasons are April-May
with the onset of southwest monsoon and
September-October with the onset of north-
east monsoon. Planting can also be done during
February-April, provided sufficient moisture is
made available through irrigation. For
maximum tuber production, April-May planting
is preferred because the crop can effectively
utilize both the monsoons. The second best
season is September-October.

cent starch with good cooking quality.
Seeds and sowing
Tapioca is propagated by stem cuttings.
Select mature healthy stems free from
diseases or pests. Discard about 10 cm from
the lower mature and about 30 cm from the
upper immature end. Stems should be cut into
setts of 15-20 cm length using a sharp knife.
About 2000 stems are required for planting
one hectare. Harvested stems are to be stored
vertically in shaded and well-aerated places.
Spraying dimethoate (0.05 per cent) on the
stem will control scale insects.
Pit, flat, ridge or mound method of planting
can be adopted depending upon soil type,
topography of land and elevation so that
waterlogging is avoided. Pit followed by mound
is found to be the best method of planting. Plant
the cuttings vertically after smoothening the
lower cut end, at a depth not exceeding 4-6
cm. Adopt square method of planting at a
spacing of 90 cm x 90 cm @ one cutting per
pit. It is preferable to adopt 75 cm x 75 cm
spacing for non-branching varieties like M-4.
Gap filling should be done within 15 days
after planting preferably with longer setts of
40 cm length. Sree Visakham is a choice
variety recommended as an intercrop in
coconut gardens. Optimum plant population is
8000 plants per ha with 90 cm x 90 cm spacing.
Land preparation
Before planting, plough the field 2-3 times
or dig to a depth 25-30 cm depending upon
soil type to establish a deep porous field in
which the setts are to be planted.
Minisett planting technique  for quality
planting material
For producing minisetts, mature, disease
free stems preferably those obtained from
indexed meristem culture should be selected.
Two node cuttings are taken from these stems
using a sharp hack-saw. Top one-third portion
is usually discarded in the traditional system,
however in the minisett technique, it is fully
utilized. The tip of the stem (about 5 to 6 cm
long) is carefully cut without causing damage.
For preventing dehydration, it is advisable to
place the tip cuttings in water. The stem just
below the growing tip is very tender with
prominent axillary buds. Hence, from this
portion, cuttings with four nodes are taken
instead of two as the latter may easily get
dried up.
Preparation of nursery:
 Select an area with well drained soil and
irrigation facility. Shade net house of
35 per cent shade is ideal for the germination
and growth of minisetts. Mark out the length
63
TAPIOCA
and breadth and make raised beds of soil : sand
mixture in equal proportion. The beds could
be of convenient length and width not exceeding
1 m. An area of 220 m2 nursery is required for
producing minisetts for planting one hectare
of land. Two node cuttings are planted end to
end horizontally, about 5 cm deep inside the
soil, with the buds facing either sides. Tip
cuttings and four node top setts should be
planted erect at 5 cm x 5 cm spacing to prevent
decay due to excess moisture in these tender
parts. Minisetts would sprout in a week’s time.
Mosaic virus infected plants, if any found,
should be rogued off as soon as such symptoms
are expressed, to keep the nursery disease
free. The minisetts will be ready for
transplanting in about three to four weeks time.
After the basal application of recommended
manure in the main field, ridges of 30 cm height
are taken with a spacing of 45 cm between
the ridges and planting is done on the ridges at
a spacing of 45 cm. Multiplication ratio by this
process is enhanced to 1: 60  as against the
traditional method 1:10.
Manuring
Cattle manure or compost may be applied
at 12.5 t ha-1 during the preparation of land or
while filling up the pits so as to provide about
1 kg of organic manure per plant. Apply
N:P2O5:K2O (kg ha-1) at the rates  shown
below:
H-97 and H 226 : 
75 : 75 : 75
H-165, Sree Visakham,
100 : 100 : 100
Sree Sahya:             
M-4 and local:        
50 : 50 : 50
N and K2O may be applied in three split
doses, i.e., 1/3 basal, 1/3 two months after
planting and 1/3 three months after planting.
Dose of P2O5 can be reduced to half where
the crop is grown for more than 3 years under
full dose of recommended fertilizers, since
under such situation there would be build up
of soil P.
For August-September planted tapioca,
apply half N, full P2O5 and half K2O basally
with first digging and weeding. The remaining
quantity of N and K2O may be applied
45 days after planting at the time of
intercultivation.
In the acid soils of Kerala, 50 per cent of
K requirement can be substituted by NaCl.
Note: N:P2O5:K2O @ 50:50:100 kg ha-1 is
recommended for Sree Visakham when
grown as an intercrop in coconut
garden. Higher levels of N tend to
increase HCN content of the tubers.
Soil application of Mg as MgSO4 @ 20 kg
ha-1 (1.62 g plant-1) and Zn as ZnSO4 @ 12.5
kg ha-1 (1g plant-1) in small channels around
the mounds within 2 months of planting cassava
providing an interval of 2 weeks between the
application of these fertilizer enhances tuber
yield and quality. When they are used
continuously, their application rates can be
fixed based on their status in the soil following
Table 14.
After cultivation
Keep the field free of weeds and maintain
soil loose by 2-3 shallow diggings or hoeing
upto 90 days after planting followed by light
earthing up. Retain two shoots on each plant
in opposite directions and remove excess
shoots about 30 days after planting.
Irrigation
Under conditions of well-distributed rainfall,
tapioca grows well as a rainfed crop and
irrigation is not necessary. However, the crop
has to be irrigated to provide sufficient moisture
TAPIOCA
64
under conditions of prolonged dry periods after
planting. When the crop is grown under
irrigation, yield increase of 150-200 per cent
over the rainfed crop has been observed.
Furrow irrigation with 25 mm water at
100 mm CPE and alternate furrow irrigation
with 50 mm water at 75 mm CPE require only
less water and labour for optimum yield.
Approximate irrigation interval schedules will
be 27 and 20 days respectively in summer
months.
Intercropping in tapioca
Tapioca is planted at a spacing of 90 cm x
90 cm and it takes about 3-3.5 months time to
have enough canopy to cover the land.
So it is possible to have an intercrop of
groundnut during the early stages of tapioca
crop. Bunch varieties like TMV-2, TMV-7,
TG-3, TG-14 and Spanish Improved are
preferred for intercropping in tapioca. The best
season for sowing groundnut is May-June.
Immediately after planting of tapioca setts,
groundnut seeds are sown at a spacing of
30 cm between rows and 20 cm within rows,
so that two rows of groundnut can be
accommodated in between two rows of
cassava. A seed rate of 40-50 kg ha-1 is
recommended for dibbling one seed per hill.
Only well-matured and bold seeds are to be
selected for sowing. In acid laterite soils of
Kerala, apply 1000 kg ha-1 of lime as basal
dressing. A basal dose of 50:100:50 kg
N:P2O5:K2O per ha should be given uniformly
to both the crops. One month after sowing of
the seed, 20 kg each P2O5 and K2O and 10 kg
N / ha-1 may be given to the intercrop along
with earthing up. Once pod formation has
started (i.e., 40-45 days after sowing) the soil
should not be disturbed, as it will affect the
pod development adversely. The groundnut
crop matures in 105 to 110 days. After the
harvest of pods, the haulms are incorporated
in the soil along with a top dressing of 50 kg
each of N and K2O per ha for the main crop.
By adopting this practice, 20-25 per cent
additional income can be obtained.
In sandy areas intercropping tapioca with
cowpea / groundnut / black gram / green gram
may be recommended giving a spacing of 20 cm
on both sides of the ridges. The non-trailing grain
cowpea variety V-26 is recommended as a
companion crop along with tapioca. For a pure
crop of tapioca or for a cropping system
involving tapioca as the main crop and the pulse
crop suggested above, the field may be irrigated
once in 36 days to a depth of 5 cm. This
recommendation is for shallow water table
situations. For deep water table situations, the
crop may be irrigated once in 24 days to a depth
of 5 cm.

Plant protection
Cassava mosaic disease (CMD)
The disease is transmitted by a white fly
Bemisia sp. As a rule, only stem cuttings from
disease free plants should be used for planting
to minimize the spread of the virus disease.
For this purpose, tagging of disease free healthy
plants for selection as planting materials must
be practised from September to December.
All plants showing even very mild symptoms
must be rejected. Mosaic tolerant varieties
such as H-97 may be used to minimize
economic loss of tubers.
Production of disease free planting
material of tapioca through nursery
techniques
Setts of 3 to 4 node cuttings from apparently
disease free plants are collected and planted
in the nursery at a very close spacing of
4 x 4 cm so that about 500 setts can be
accommodated in one square metre land. Daily
watering of the setts has to be done for the
first 10 days and on alternate days afterwards.
Screening of CMD symptoms may be started
10 days after planting. Setts showing even mild
symptoms are to be removed and burnt. This
must be continued up to 20-25 days, by that
time healthy seedlings can be transplanted to
the main field. Supplementary irrigation may
be given in the transplanted field till they get
established. Screening for disease symptoms
and roguing of infested plants may be continued
in field at weekly intervals upto harvest. The
selected healthy stems are again cut into
minisetts and subjected to nursery and field
screening. By adopting this technique it is
possible to produce healthy plants.
Leaf spot
Spray 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture for
control of leaf spot.
Bacterial blight
Bacterial blight is a disease noted in severe
proportion in certain parts of Kerala. Chemical
control is not effective. Use of resistant or
tolerant varieties is the only method of control.
Among improved varieties, H-97, H-226,
H-1687 and H-2304 are tolerant to the disease
while H-165 is highly susceptible. Among the
local varieties, M-4, Paluvella, Pichivella,
Parappilappan, Anamaravan etc. are tolerant
to the disease.
Red spider mites and scale insects
Red spider mites in the field and scale
insects under storage are important pests of
tapioca. Under field conditions light infestation
of mites can be controlled effectively by
spraying the crop with water at 10 days interval
from the onset of mite infestation. In the case
of very severe infestation, the crop can be
protected by spraying 0.05 per cent dimethoate
at monthly intervals from the time of
appearance of mites.
The stem may be sprayed with 0.05 per
cent dimethoate before storing as a
prophylactic measure against the scales.
Termites
To control termites infesting planted
setts, sprinkle chlorpyrifos in the mounds prior
to planting.
Management of storage pests of cassava
Treating chips with granular salt (3 per
cent), sun drying thoroughly and storing in
gunny bags in godown are very effective
against Araecerus fasciculatus and
Sitophilus oryzae.
Harvesting
Tapioca becomes ready for harvest 9-10
months after planting. Hybrid varieties like
H-226, H-97 and H-165, when grown under
recommended management practices have
recorded yields up to 40-50 t ha-1 of raw tuber.

COLEUS (Solenostemon rotundifolius)
Coleus thrives well in tropical and
subtropical regions. A well-drained medium
fertile soil is suitable for its cultivation.
Season
Plant the cuttings in the main field between
July and October.
Variety: Nidhi, Sree Dhara and Suphala.
Sree Dhara – First variety in chinese potato
with good cooking quality and 5 months
duration.
Nidhi – Variety released from RARS, Pattambi
with 5 months duration.
Suphala – A tissue culture mutant derived by
KAU from local cultivar suited for year round
cultivation 
with 
a 
duration 
of
120 - 140 days.
Nursery
Raise the nursery approximately one month
before planting. An area of 500 to 600 m2 is
sufficient to produce cuttings required for one
ha of main field. Apply 125 to 150 kg FYM in
the nursery area. Plant the seed tubers at a
spacing of 15 cm on the ridges taken 30 cm
apart. About 170 to 200 kg of tubers is required
to raise the nursery. Take the vine cutting to a
length of 10-15 cm from the top portion after
three weeks from planting.
Preparation of main field
Plough or dig the land to a depth of
15-20 cm and form ridges  30 cm apart or
raised beds of 60-90 cm width.
Planting
Plant the vine cutting collected from the
nursery on ridges at a spacing of 30 cm or on
raised beds at 30 cm x 15 cm spacing.
Manuring
Broadcast 10 tonnes of FYM and N:P2O5:
K2O @ 30:60:50 kg ha-1 and incorporate into
the soil at the time of land preparation. Topdress
with N and K2O at the rate of 30 and 50 kg
ha-1 respectively at 45 days after planting.
After cultivation
Give weeding and earthing up, at 45 days
after planting along with topdressing. Cover a
portion of the vine with soil to promote tuber
formation.
Plant protection
To control the root-knot nematode, deep
plough the field  in summer, adopt crop rotation
and destroy root residues and other plant parts
by burning.
Harvesting
Harvest the crop 5 months after planting.
67
COLEUS
Cashew is adapted to warm humid
tropical conditions.  It can be grown in
almost all types of soils from sandy to
laterite and up to an elevation of 600-700 m
including wastelands of low fertility.
It grows and yield best in well-drained red
sandy loams and light coastal sands.  Heavy
clay soils, poor drainage conditions, very low
temperature and frost are unsuitable
for the crop.
Planting materials
Cashew can be propagated by seedlings,
air layers and softwood grafts. Since it
is a cross-pollinated crop, vegetative
propagation is recommended to obtain true
to type progeny.  Field establishment of air
layers have been found to be poor.  Hence
softwood grafts, which give a high rate of
establishment and early flowering, are
recommended for planting (Table 15).

1.  Propagation by seedlings
Selection of mother trees
Select mother trees having the following
characteristics: (1) Good health, vigorous
growth and intensive branching habit
with panicles having high percentage of
hermaphrodite flowers. (2) Trees of 15-25
years of age. (3) Bearing nuts of medium size
and weight (5-8 g/nut) with an average yield
of 15 kg nuts per annum.  (4) Bearing 7-8 nuts
per panicle.
Selection of nuts
Select mother trees in February and
collect seed nuts in March-April.  Select good,
mature, medium sized nuts, which sink in
water as seeds after drying in sun for two to
three days.
Raising seedlings
Raise seedlings in polythene bags during
May.  Use polythene bags of size 20 cm x 15
cm and fill the bags with garden soil,
leaving a gap of 1 to 1.5 cm above.  Soak seed
nuts in water for 18 to 24 hours to
hasten germination.  Sow the pre-soaked seed
nuts in polythene bags filled with garden soil at
a depth of 2-3 cm with the stalk end up.  Seeds
germinate in seven to ten days.
2.  Propagation by air layering
Prepare air layers during February-March,
so that they will be ready for planting in June-
July.  Select 9-12 months old pencil-thick
terminal shoots.  Remove carefully a strip or
ring of bark, 0.6 to 1.2 cm thick by using a
sharp knife without injuring the underlying
wood.  Wind a string around the cut area and
cover it with moist moss or wood shavings or
sand and saw dust mixture or ordinary potting
mixture and wrap round with 150-200 gauge
polythene film of size 23 cm x 15 cm.  Secure
loose ends of film with jute fibre.  When roots
emerge from the ringed portion in 40-60 days,
give a ‘V’ cut at lower end of treated shoot.
After about 15 days, deepen the cut slightly.
Cut and separate rooted shoot about 7 days
later.  Pot the layers immediately after sepa-
ration from the tree into containers of size
15 x 15 cm made from coconut husk and keep
them in shade.  Avoid excessive watering.
Plant the layers along with the container in the
prepared pits with the onset of southwest
monsoon.  Provide shade and mulch with dry
leaves to reduce sun-scorch in tender plants.
It is advisable to defoliate the layers two weeks
before separation from the mother
plant.
3.  Propagation by grafting / budding
Different methods of grafting viz.,
epicotyl grafting, softwood grafting, veneer
grafting, side grafting, patch budding etc. have
been tried in cashew with varying degrees of
success.  Among them, softwood grafting was
found to be the best for commercial multipli-
cation of cashew.
Softwood grafting
Selection of seed nuts
(1) Seed nuts may be collected during the peak
period of harvest (February-March) and sun-
dried for 2-3 days.  (2) Quality seed nuts may
be selected by immersing in water or
10 per cent saline solution.  Seeds, which sink
in water, may be selected.  (3) Medium sized
nuts (7-9 g) may be selected to get
vigorously growing seedlings.
Raising rootstocks
1.
Fresh seed nuts are to be used for
raising rootstock.  Seed nuts stored for
more than one year may be avoided.
69
CASHEW
2. The seed nuts should be soaked in water
overnight before sowing.
3. Use polythene bags (size 25 cm x 15 cm,
300 gauge thickness) for filling potting
mixture.
4. Punch about 16-20 holes on the polythene
bags to ensure good drainage.
5. Prepare the potting mixture (1:1:1 ratio of
red soil, river sand and compost) mixed with
rock phosphate @ 5 g per 2 kg potting
mixture.
6. Fill the polythene bags up to the brim of
the bag.
7. Sow the pre-soaked nuts in the centre of
the bag with stalk end up, at a depth of
2.0-2.5 cm.
8. Water the bags immediately after
sowing and daily thereafter. Avoid excess
irrigation.
9. Nuts usually germinate within 15-20 days
after sowing during monsoon months and
within 8-10 days during dry months.
10. Nuts should be sown at weekly intervals
to get continuous supply of rootstocks.
11. During summer, provide partial shade to
the seedlings till they change their bronze
colour to green and then keep them in the
open.
12. The seedlings will be ready for grafting in
50-60 days after germination.
13. Prevent damage to germinating nuts from
squirrels, birds etc.
14. During the rainy season, damping off
of young seedlings is common.  To
control this disease, spraying / drenching
Bordeaux mixture (1per cent) is effective.
Selection of rootstock
Select 50-60 days old healthy seedlings
having single main stem grown in the centre
of the polythene bag, as rootstock.
Selection of scions
(1) Select a high yielding variety of cashew
as mother plant to collect adequate number of
scions.  (2) Select 3-5 month old non-flower-
ing lateral shoots of current season’s growth.
(3) The selected scions should be 10-12 cm
long, straight, uniformly round and pencil thick
with brown colour having dormant plumpy
terminal bud.  The top 4-5 leaves should be
dark green in colour indicating proper maturity
of the scion.
Pre-curing
(1) Pre-cure the selected scions by clipping
off three fourth portion of leaf blades.
(2) Scions will be ready for grafting in
7-10 days after leaf removal.
Collection of scions
(1) The pre-cured scions are to be cut early
in the morning to avoid desiccation.
(2) The scions should be collected before the
terminal buds sprout.  (3) Wrap scions in moist
cloth and put in polythene covers as soon as
they are cut from the mother tree and bring
them to the nursery for grafting.  If necessary,
they can be stored for 3-4 days and used for
grafting.
Preparation of rootstock
(1) Retain two pairs of bottom leaves and
remove others from the selected seedlings
using a sharp knife.  (2) Give a transverse cut
on the main stem, 15 cm above ground level.
(3) A cleft of 4-5 cm deep is made in the middle
of the decapitated stem of the seedling by giv-
ing a longitudinal cut.
Preparation of scion
(1) Select a matching scion stick (same
thickness as that of the rootstock).  (2) The
cut end of the scion is shaped to a wedge of
4-5 cm long by chopping the bark and wood
from two opposite sides.
 CASHEW
70
Grafting
1. The wedge of the scion is inserted into the
cleft of the rootstock, taking care to en-
sure that the cambium layers of stock and
scion are in perfect contact with each other.
2. The graft joint is secured firmly by a
polythene tape (1.5 cm wide and 30 cm
long).
3. The scion of the graft is to be covered with
a wet polythene cap (15 cm x 12.5 cm. 100
gauge thickness) and tied at the
bottom to maintain humidity inside and to
protect the apical bud from drying.  The
polythene cap should not touch the
terminal bud. A narrow polythene cover of
size 20 cm x 3 cm (sip-up-cover) can also
be used instead of above said polythene
cap.
4. The grafted plants are to be kept under
shade for 10-15 days to enable sprouting
of the terminal buds.
5. The polythene caps are to be removed and
the grafts shifted to open place.  The
successful grafts show signs of growth
within 3-4 weeks after grafting.
6. The grafts will be ready for planting
5-6 months after grafting.
7. The success in softwood grafting is more
during the period from March to Septem-
ber under Kerala conditions.
Care in the nursery
1. The grafts are to be watered regularly
using a rose can or micro-sprinkler.
2. Remove new sprouts emerging from
rootstock at frequent intervals.
3. Panicles, if produced by the grafts, may be
removed as and when observed.
4. Grafts should be placed on polythene sheets
spread on the ground to prevent rooting.
5. Shift the grafts frequently from one place
to another to prevent them from striking
roots into the ground.
6. Spray recommended  insecticides for
controlling the infestation of sucking
insects as and when required.
Graft production under polyhouse
Softwood grafts can be prepared almost
throughout the year with a mean graft
success of about 60-70 per cent.  Higher
success is achieved during the monsoon
season.  For this, low cost polyhouses
(prepared from casuarina/bamboo poles/areca
reapers / GI pipes/PVC pipes and covered
with high density polythene sheet of conve-
nient dimensions) preferably 20 m long and
6 m wide may be utilized for graft production.
The height of the polyhouse should be 2.5 m in
the middle and 1.0 m on both sides.  The plants
may be watered using hose.  Misting units can
also be fitted at appropriate points and switched
on for about 5-10 minutes at an interval of two
hours from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. during summer
season. This reduces the temperature build up
inside the polyhouse.  Raising of rootstock
seedlings, grafting of rootstocks and mainte-
nance of grafts can be done inside the
polyhouses. These polyhouses give protection
to the seedlings and grafts during heavy rains
and reduce the mortality.  Again during
summer months the seedlings/grafts can be
maintained in these polyhouses by covering
with HDPE shade nets (35-50 per cent shade).
Planting and management of grafts
The softwood grafts will be ready for plant-
ing in 5-6 months after grafting. The pits are
filled with topsoil and 5-10 kg of compost or
dried cowdung / pit and the grafts are planted
after carefully removing the polythene bags.
Care should be taken while planting to see that
the graft union is 2.5 cm above the ground level.
The polythene tape is to be carefully cut and
removed subsequently.  Staking should be done
immediately after planting to avoid lodging.
71
CASHEW
Planting and management of plantation
Plant softwood grafts in pits of size 50 cm x
50 cm x 50 cm during June-July.
Planting may be done at a spacing of
7.5 m for poor and 10 m for rich and deep soils
and sandy coastal area.  On very sloppy lands,
the rows may be spaced 10-15 m apart with a
spacing of 6-8 m between trees in a row.
Depending upon the weed growth, weeding
operation may be done during August-
September.  Mulch the plant base with dry
leaves to reduce sun-scorch to tender plants.
Herbicides can be used for controlling
weeds. Apply glyphosate 0.8 kg ai/ha-1, once
in June-July.
Initial training / shape pruning
The sprouts coming from the rootstock
portion of the graft, that is from the portion
below the graft joint, should be removed
frequently during the first year of planting.
Initial training and pruning of young cashew
plants during the first 3-4 years is essential for
providing proper shape.  Thereafter, little or
no pruning is necessary.  The plants should be
allowed to grow by maintaining a single stem
up to 0.75-1.00 m from ground level.  This can
be achieved by removing the side shoots or
side branches gradually as the plants start
growing from the second year of planting.
Weak and criss-cross branches can also be
removed.  Branches growing unwidely may also
be cut off.  Proper staking of the plants is
required to avoid lodging due to wind during
the initial years of planting.  Initial training and
pruning of cashew plants facilitate easy cultural
operations such as terrace making, weeding,
fertilizer application, nut collection and plant
protection.  The flower panicles emerging from
the grafts during the first and second year of
planting 
should 
also 
be 
removed
(de-blossoming) in order to allow the plant to
put up good vegetative growth. The plants are
allowed to flower and fruit only from the third
year onwards.
General pruning
In older cashew plantations, removal of dried
or dead wood, criss-cross branches, water
shoots etc. should be attended to at least once
in 2-3 years. This allows proper growth of the
canopy and receipt of adequate sunlight on all
the branches. Pruning of cashew plants should
be done during May / June.
Manuring
A fertilizer dose of 750 g N, 325 g P2O5 and
750 g K2O per plant is recommended for
cashew. Apply 1/5th dose after the completion
of first year, 2/5th dose during second year and
thus reaching full dose from 5th year onwards.
Broadcast the fertilizer within an area of 0.5 to
3.0 m (15 cm deep) around the tree and
incorporate by light raking.
Intercropping
Pineapple is the most profitable intercrop
in cashew plantation in the early stages of
growth.  It can be planted between two rows
of cashew in trenches opened across the slope.
Paired row of pineapple suckers can be planted
in each trench at 60 cm between rows and
40 cm between two suckers within the row.
These trenches can be opened at 1 m
between two rows of cashew.  Ginger, lemon-
grass and tapioca are also suitable as
intercrops.
High density planting
High density planting is a technique
recommended for enhancing the productivity
of cashew plantations. This technique involves
planting more number of grafts per unit area
and thinning at later stages. Instead of the
normal planting density of 64 to 177 plants per
hectare (spacing ranging from 7.5 to 10 m in
the square system of planting) or 74 to 204
 CASHEW
72
73
CASHEW
plants (spacing ranging from 7.5 to 10 m in the
triangular system of planting), 312 to 625 grafts
will be planted per hectare, initially.  During
later years, as the canopy develops, plant
population is to be regulated by selective felling
to minimize competition.
While adopting a high density planting
technique, grafts may be planted initially at a
spacing of 4 m  x 4 m or 8 m x 4 m so that
there will be 625 or 312 plants respectively.
This population can be retained for a period of
seven to nine or ten years depending upon the
canopy expansion rate. If the soil is very rich
the canopy development rate will be faster.
High density planting would be more useful in
poor soils where the rate of canopy expansion
is slow.  Considering the fertility status of the
soil, the level of management in terms of
fertilization, irrigation etc. the initial plant
population is to be decided carefully for every
agro-climatic condition. Later, after monitor-
ing the canopy pressure between adjacent
plants, the alternate plants are to be removed.
Finally, when the plants attain full growth, the
spacing between the plants will be 8 m x 8 m.
If uniform management practices are
adopted, during early years of yield, the
per tree nut yield will be more or less the same
with all the trees, in both the conventional
system of planting and in high density planting.
But the per hectare yield will be more from
high-density plantations (due to higher plant
population) compared to the normal density
plantations.  During later years, when the plant
population is equalized to that of normal
density plantation, the productivity of both the
plantations would be more or less the same.
The bonus yield obtained during the early years
of yield would be substantial in high-density plan-
tations.
Top working
Top working is a technique evolved to
 rejuvenate unproductive and senile cashew
trees.  Top working can successfully rejuve-
nate poor yielders in the age group of 5-20
years.  The unproductive trees are to be
beheaded at a height of 0.75 to 1.00 m from
ground level.  The stem should be cut with a
saw to avoid stump splitting.  The best season
for beheading trees is May-September.  Soon
after beheading, the stumps and cut portions
should be given a swabbing with copper
oxychloride and carbaryl 50 WP (50 g each
per litre of water).  Sprouts emerge 30-45 days
after beheading.  Sprouting will be profuse in
young trees.  New, 20-25 days old shoots should
be grafted with scions of high yielding variet-
ies using softwood grafting technique. To
ensure at least six or seven successful grafts,
10-15 grafting are to be done on the new shoots
of every tree.  The best season for grafting is
July–November. Thinning of the extra shoots
arising from the stumps should be done to
obtain better growth of the grafts.  Removal
of sprouts below the graft joint and removal of
polythene strip from the graft joint should be
done. Top working is simple and can be done
by farmers after getting proper training.
The top worked trees start yielding right
from the second year after top working.  Thus
precocity can be considered as one of the best
advantages of this technique. The major
disadvantage associated with top working is
the huge casualty of trees due to stem borer
attack.  Intensive care and management to ward
off stem borer is essential.  As such, adoption
of top working on a larger scale would be dif-
ficult.
Pest and diseases
Tea mosquito bug
This is the most serious pest affecting
cashew. The pest usually appears with the
emergence of new flushes and panicle.
Drying of inflorescence and dieback of shoots
are the symptoms. For control of tea
mosquito bug, spray  0.05 per cent quinalphos
or 0.003 per cent Lambda cyhalothrin or
 CASHEW
74
thiamethoxam 25 WG 0.2 g/l. For organic
cashew cultivation, pongamia oil @ 2 ml/l or
Beaveria bassiana @ 20 g/l can be sprayed.
A rational rotation of insecticides would be de-
sirable to counteract the tendency of the pest
to develop field resistance.  Spraying may be
done once, twice or thrice depending upon ne-
cessity.
First spraying is to be given synchronizing
with the emergence of new vegetative flushes
in October-November. The second spraying
may be given synchronizing with the
commencement of panicle emergence in
December-January. The third spraying may be
given at completion of flowering / initiation of
fruit set in January – February.
Note: Avoid spraying 0.003 per cent Lambda
cyhalothrin at the time of flowering, as
it is highly toxic to honey bees.
Cashew stem and root borer (CSRB)
This is a serious pest, which is capable of
destroying the cashew tree.  Main symptoms
of attack are yellowing of leaves, drying of
twigs, presence of holes at the base of stem
with exuding sap and frass.
Check regulary for symptoms of CSRB
attack particularly during January – May
period. In the case of already infested trees,
mechanically remove various stages of pest
(grubs and pupae) by carefully chiseling the
bark. Care should be taken to avoid removal
of more than 50 per cent of total bark
circumference. Swab the chiseled area by
using chlorpyriphos 20 EC (0.2 per cent @ 10
ml 1-1) and drench the pesticide solution onto
the soil near the root zone to minimize
reinfestation by the pest.
Prophylactic treatment by swabbing the
trunk region (up to 1 m height from the ground
level) and exposed roots, with a suspension of
mud slurry + coal tar and kerosene (1:2) or 5
per cent neem oil twice a year during March –
April and November – December.
To reduce the spread of infestation, it is
essential to remove the dead trees and trees in
advanced stage of infestation at least once in
6 months. Dead trees and trees beyond
recovery - trees having yellow canopy and /or
more than 50 per cent bark circumference
damage needs to be uprooted. Pest stages
occurring in the roots should be destroyed so
as to reduce pest inoculum in the future.
Dieback or pink disease
This disease is prevalent in cashew
plantations during rainy season. Main
symptom of attack is the appearance of white
patches on branches followed by drying of
twigs from the tip.
Chisel out the affected parts and apply
Bordeaux paste. Give prophylactic sprays of
1 per cent Bordeaux mixture during May-June
and October.
Note:
1. For grown up trees, 5 litres of spray fluid
would be required at high volume discharge
rate and 2.5 litres at the low volume
discharge rate. For spraying, rocker sprayer
with hi-tree lance is preferable.
2. For low volume application, the concen-
tration of the insecticides is to be maintained
at 0.1 per cent for quinalphos. It is difficult
to cover the entire canopy with low volume
equipment. In such cases, the uncovered
upper canopy areas may be covered with
rocker sprayer fitted with hi-tree lance
system.
3. Dusting powder formulations are not
recommended against tea mosquito bug.
4. Spray  0.003 per cent Lambda cyhalothrin
as a prophylaxis against pest infestation in
nursery plants.
5. Spray Bordeaux mixture 1 per cent to
seedlings as a prophylactic measure
against fungal diseases.
6. In anthracnose and tea mosquito endemic
area following practices are recommended
About 50-60 per cent raw juice with 9-10 per
cent soluble solids can be obtained. The
astringent taste of cashew apple is due to the
presence of tannins in it. The tannin present in
the raw juice can be removed through
clarification by adopting one of the following
methods:-
1.
Take 5g powdered sago in minimum
quantity of water, heat and make into paste
by stirring and cool it. Add sago paste into
one litre juice and mix well by stirring.
Decant the clear juice after 12 hours.
2.
Mix gelatin @ 0.5 g kg-1 of raw juice and
allow to settle. Decant the clear juice and
discard the sediment (gelatin may be
dissolved in water by heating).
3.
Mix poly vinyl pyrollidone @ 1.4 g kg-1 of
raw juice. Allow to settle and decant the
clear juice.
4.
Mix about 125 ml of fresh rice gruel
(kanjivellam) and allow to settle. Decant
the clear upper layer and repeat the
process using 125 ml of rice gruel.
Tannin can be removed from mature or ripe
apples (de-tanning) by adopting the following
procedures:-
1.  Detanning of ripe whole apples :  Clean
the apples and immerse in 5 per cent salt
solution for 3 days with the change of salt
solution daily. Take out the fruit on the 4th
day and wash thoroughly in water. The fruit
is now de-tanned.
2. Detanning of mature but unripe whole
green apples for pickle preparation :
Wash the raw green fruit and cut into small
pieces. Keep in 8 per cent salt solution for
3 days with the change of salt solution daily.
Take out the fruits on the 4th day and wash
Post Harvest Utilization of Cashew Apple
Cashew apple is a valuable source of
sugars, minerals and vitamins especially
vitamin C and can be used for preparation of
various products.
Preliminary Processing
Select crisp, firm, tight and full colour
developed best quality apples. It should have
medium to large size, more than 70 per cent
juice, more than 11 per cent sugar and
0.39- 0.42 per cent acidity. Since highly
susceptible to physical injury and microbial
spoilage, collect apples every day, after
separating the nuts, when it falls to the ground.
The selected fruits are washed with water.
Stainless steel or glass containers should
be used for processing, after sterilization.
Copper, iron, aluminum and brass containers
should not be used as it will blacken the
products. Plastic buckets or barrels can be used
for dipping and cleaning fruits.
Juice can be extracted from ripe cashew
apples, after washing, using screw press,
basket press, hydraulic press or by hand
pressing with the help of citrus juice extractor.

COTTON (Gossypium sp.)
Cotton is grown from sea level to moder-
ate elevations not exceeding 1000 m where
the climate is tropical with rainfall 500 to
750 mm. Excessive rain at any stage is
harmful to the crop. It can be grown in a wide
variety of soils. A deep homogeneous fertile
soil is desirable.
Seasons
Winter crop
: August – September
Summer crop
: February – March
Cotton varieties with spacing and duration
are given in Table 17 and seed rate for cotton
is given in Table 18.
Preparation of land and sowing
Plough the land three to four times and form
ridges and furrows. Dibble the seeds on the
sides of the furrows. Use basalin @ 2.5 l ha
 -1
before irrigating the feel to control weeds.
Note: Treat the seeds with carbendazim
50 WP (2 g kg-1) or Trichoderma viride
talc preparation (4 g kg-1) before
sowing.
Manuring
Apply FYM or compost @ 12.5 t ha-1 for
rainfed crop and 25 t ha-1 for irrigated crop.
Apply N:P2O5:K2O each @ 35 kg ha-1 as basal
dressing.  Top dress with 35 kg N per ha-1
about 45 days after sowing.
After cultivation
Thin the crop when the plants are 15 to
20 cm high, retaining two seedlings per hill.
Retain only one seedling per hill in the case of
hybrids.  Timely weeding and hoeing will
ensure good crop growth.
Irrigation
In the case of irrigated crop, irrigate
the plants once in two weeks.  Copious
irrigation during flowering will ensure good pod
setting and good fibre quality.
Plant Protection
Against sucking pests like jassids,
aphids and thrips, spray imidacloprid
(100 ml ha-1) on 20th day and 40th day.

RUBBER (Hevea brasiliensis)
Rubber can be cultivated from sea level up
to an altitude of 500 m.  The major rubber
tract experiences a monsoon climate with
annual rain fall ranging from 2000 – 4500 mm.
Soils of the traditional belt are highly weathered
and are mostly laterite and lateritic types.  Red
and alluvial soils are also found in some areas.
Rubber grows in a wide range of soils
however, deep well drained soils free from
underlying sheet rocks are well suited for the
cultivation of rubber.
Propagation
1. Clonal seeds : Collected from approved
seed gardens in the country and abroad
2. Budded plants: Either poly bag or root
trainer plants can be used for planting
Approved cultivars
The planting material recommendation  of
the Rubber Board is based on a multi clone
concept. Monoclonal plantations in general are
prone   to the outbreak of epidemics  and  RRII
105 is prone  to Corynespora leaf disease as
manifested in the Karnataka region during the
year 2000. Realizing the potential risk involved
in monoclonal planting, the Board  from 1991,
has been recommending planting of as many
clones as practicable, out of  a select list of
desirable clones.
The clones under each category for the
different regions are listed below:
a.
Traditional region
Category I : Clone: RRII 105, RRII  430,
RRII 414, RRII 417,  RRII 422 and PB
260
Category II :  Clone RRIM 600, GT  I,
RRII 5, RRII  203, PB 28/59,  PB 217,
PB 255, PB 280, PB  312 and PB 314
Category III  Clones RRII 118,  RRII
208, RRII 300, RRII 429,  PR 107, PR

1.5 kg ha-1).  For grey mildew, carbendazim
@ 250 g ha-1 may be used.  For Alternaria
leaf spot, use copper oxychloride @ 1.5 kg ha-1.
Harvesting
The bolls start bursting 100-120 days
after sowing and will be ready for harvest at
this stage.
280, PB 312, PB 314, PB 235,  RRII 5,
RRII 300, PB 311* and RRII 105* have
exhibited good growth  and yield in the
region.
* RRII 105 is highly susceptible to
Corynespora leaf disease. Hence
recommended prophylactic and control
measures are to be adopted. PB 217 and
RRII 203 are also susceptible to the
disease and require prophylactic
protection. PB 311 is wind susceptible
hence planting of this clone in wind prone
areas is to be avoided.
d. Planting materials suitable for North
Konkan
RRIM 600, RRII 208, RRII 105,
RRII 6, RRII 5, PB 260, PR 255 and
RRIC 100 perform well in this region.
The RRII 400 series clones have not been
evaluated in North Konkan.   However,
the drought tolerant and stable clone RRII
430 shows good initial establishment and
growth and could be planted in the region.
Lifesaving irrigation is to be given to all
clonal plantings in the first three years.
For cultivation under rainfed/unirrigated
conditions, polyclonal seedlings are the
best choice.
Category 1  consists of clones officially
released by the Rubber  Board of India for
planting in large areas. However, it is
recommended that any one of these clones
may be used to plant only up to 50 per cent of
the total area of a large holding.
Category II consists of clones with consistent
performance in this country over a long term
in large scale trials. It is recommended that
combinations of three or more of these clones
may be used to plant up to 50% of the total
area of a large holding.  Cattle manure and 4
kg of rock phosphate for every 100 m2 of
nursery bed is recommended as basal dressing.
When the same area is repeatedly used, rock
phosphate needs to be applied only once in
three years.  Application of 275 kg urea, 700
kg rock phosphate (18%  P2O5), 85 kg muriate
of potash and 235 kg  magnesium sulphate or
1250  kg 10-10-4-1.5 NPKMg mixture and
118 kg magnesium sulphate per hectare
6 – 8 weeks  after planting is recommended.
Zinc sulphate @ 25kg/ha may be applied
2 weeks after the fertilizer application. After
6 – 8 weeks from first fertilizer application,
urea may be applied @ 275 kg/ha.
Subsequently, application of Zinc Sulphate in
the nursery may be carried out on soil test basis.
Plant protection by regular spraying of
fungicides and insecticides will be  necessary
to prevent disease/insect pest  damage.  When
sufficiently grown, seedlings can be used for
budding.
Bud wood nursery
Bud wood nursery is raised by planting
polybag  plants  or  budded stumps of authentic
planting materials of desired clones at a spacing
of 90 x 60 cm.   Before planting, bud wood
nurseries are given a basal dose 165 kg of
powdered rock phosphate per hectare (1.65
kg/100 m2).  Two to three months after
planting, 125 g of 10-10-4-1.5 NPKMg mixture
per plant is applied. A second application at
the same rate is given 8 to 9 months after
planting. This dose should also be applied 2-3
months after each harvest of bud wood. The
first harvest of brown bud wood is done one
year after planting by cutting the shoot 30 cm
above the bud union.  Two sprouts are allowed
to grow for the second harvest after similar
growth. This process of cutting back each
healthy shoot is to be repeated every year to
allow regeneration of fresh bud wood.
Green bud shoots are generated by cutting
back the growing shoots in a bud wood nursery
6 to 8 weeks before bud grafting.

Polybag and root trainer nurseries
Polybag and root trainer grown plants grow
well when maintained in poly houses. This is
particularly useful for green/young budded
plants. Reduction in disease incidence and
increased growth is observed in poly houses.
Prevention of excess sunlight using shade nets
and appropriate ventilation to avoid heat and
humidity build up are necessary for healthy
growth of plants. Regular but controlled
watering and manuring are essential.
Category  III  consists of superior clones with
proven merit in small scale trials and found
promising in the early years in large scale trials
in India or abroad (in the case of introduced
clones). These clones are recommended for
only experimental planting on a limited scale
not to exceed 15 per cent of the total area in
aggregate. Polyclonal seeds are also included
in this category and recommended for planting
in marginal areas.
Most of the modern high yielding clones
are prone to tapping panel dryness when
tapped under half spiral alternate daily system.
It is, therefore, strongly recommended that all
such clones be tapped at a lower intensity, say,
on half spiral once in three days. Prophylactic
protection against diseases is recommended
for the cultivation of all these clones.
Rubber Nursery
Nurseries are maintained for raising
seedlings, budded plants and bud wood. As
rubber seed viability is very short, seeds are
collected for planting soon after fruit dehision.
Germination beds are prepared with the top
5cm made up of river sand or well leached
coir pith. The beds should be raised 10-15 cm
above ground to avoid water logging and be
of 90 cm width and convenient length.  Partial
shading may be provided to protect from strong
sunlight. Seeds are sown closely in single layer
and pressed firmly into the sand leaving the
surface of seeds just visible above the sand.
Seeds sprouted on each day should be picked
into a vessel containing water to avoid injury.
The picked seeds should be planted in seedling
nursery without any delay.
Seedling nursery
Level lands with water table at least 60 cm
below is ideal for raising seedling nursery.
Shaded areas should be avoided.  Soil should
be deep, well drained loam with good fertility
status. Raised beds (15 cm) should be
prepared with width of 60 to 120 cm and
convenient length with pathways in between
to facilitate cultural operations.
The spacing adopted for planting in seedling
nurseries are 23 x 23 cm (for green budding)
and 30 x 30 cm (for brown budding).
Application of a pre-emergent herbicide
Diuron at the rate of 2.5 kg in 700 litres of
water per effective hectare if applied after
preparation of beds prevent weed grown for
6 to 7 weeks. Manual weeding should be done
at monthly intervals. Mulching in between the
plant rows reduces weed growth besides
conserving soil moisture and regulating soil
temperature. Addition of 25 kg of compost or
dried FYM is also recommended.
Planting materials
The generally used planting materials are
seedling stumps, budded stumps, polybag plants
and root trainer plants.
Stumps: Seedling stumps are prepared by
pulling out polyclonal seedlings and cutting
back the stem at 45 to 60 cm of brown wood,
tap root to convenient length and trimming of
lateral roots (7.5 cm length).  The cut end of
stem is dipped in molten wax to prevent water
loss. Budded stumps are prepared in the same
way as seedling stumps but a slanting cut with
slope towards opposite side of bud is gen at
about 7.5 cm above the bud patch.
83
RUBBER
 RUBBER

Polybag plants: Polybag plants are raised
either by budding seedlings that are developed
by in situ planting of seeds (in polybags) or by
planting budded stumps in polybags. Polythene
(LDPE/HDPE) bags of 45 x 18 cm holding
about 7 kg soil are generally used. Larger bags
55 x 25 cm which holds about 10 kg soil are
preferred for raising larger plants (3 whorls or
more).  The polythene material used for the
bag should be 75-100 micron thickness (300-
400 gauge). The bags should be filled with top
soil. About 20 to 25 g rock phosphate is
incorporated in the top half of the soil filled in
the polybags.  Monthly application of the
fertilizer 10:10:4:1.5 NPK Mg mixtures at 10g/
plant initially, gradually increasing up to 30 g/
plant, when each top whorl of leaf is mature is
recommended. Regular watering and weeding
is necessary.  Partial shading (50% shade)
during dry season reduces incidence of leaf
spot diseases and sun scorch besides regulating
transpiration loss.  Plants are transplanted to
the main field when they are at two to three
whorl stages and the top whorl of leaves is
mature.
Root trainer plants:  The root trainer cups
usually have a length of 26 cm and a holding
capacity of 600 cc with vertical ridges on the
inside wall and tapering with a drainage hole
at the bottom.  Well cured coir pith (washing
with water at least for two months to leach
out all toxic compounds) mixed with neem
cake, bone meal, pesticides and single super
phosphate is used as potting medium.  Partially
dried elephant dung mixed with equal quantity
of  soil can also be used as an alternative to
coir pith.  The potting medium should be
packed well inside the root trainer cup before
planting seeds.  Root trainers are stacked in a
raised bed of soil so as to facilitate tap root
development. When the plants show healthy
growth, the root trainer is lifted from the bed,
tap root pruned near the drainage hole and
stacked on stand made or iron/bamboo
splinters.  The tap root undergoes natural air
pruning, which induces stress and thereby
several lateral roots emerge inside the
container.  The ridges on the side walls direct
these laterals to the drainage hole which also
undergoes air pruning.  Thus a hardened root
trainer plant consists of a dense root plug with
tap root and well oriented lateral roots.
Planting
Planting should be done with the onset of
monsoon when the weather conditions are
ideal with sufficient rains.
Spacing: The density of planting recom-
mended is 420-520 plants per hectare (170 to
200/acre). However for the clone RRII 105
the density can be upto 550/ha. Some common
spacing adopted and the corresponding number
of plants is given in Table 19.
Lining: In flat or slightly undulating areas,
square or rectangular planting can be adopted.
For rectangular planting, lines should be taken
east-west  to get maximum sunlight.  Contour
lining is done on undulating and hilly lands by
marking out the planting points in contour lines
across the slope.
Soil and water conservation: Formation of
terraces is a recommended practice in hilly
areas to conserve soil and water.  In order to
reduce erosion further and to facilitate rain
water infiltration trenches of about 120 cm
length, 45 cm width and 60 cm depth are taken
along with contour in between the planting
rows.  Construction of stone-pitched contour
retaining walls (edakayyalas) is another
effective method to restrict surface runoff.
Drainage: Proper drainage is essential
especially on low-lying lands. The natural
85
RUBBER
waterways existing in the plantation may be
cleared or deepened to give adequate
drainage. If drains are cut, uniform depth
should be maintained throughout.
Pitting
Pits are taken either manually or
mechanically using tractor-mounted hole-
diggers or earth mover.  The texture and depth
determine the size of the pit.  In soils with a
depth of one meter or more, planting can be
done in small pits dug to accommodate polybag
plants.  However in hard soils, planting should
be done in larger pits of size 75 cm3 or 90 cm3
depending on hardness.
While digging the pit, the top soil should be
placed on one side and subsoil on the other.
Filling should be done with top soil after
removing stones and roots.  Compost or well-
rotted cattle manure @ 12 kg and rock
phosphate 200 g are mixed with the top 20 cm
soil in the  pit. When small pits are taken, the
manure should be incorporated around the plant
basin leaving around 15 cm from bud union.
In newly-cleared forest areas, 200 g rock
phosphate alone would suffice.
Field planting
Seed-at-stake: Two to three germinated
seeds are directly planted in the centre of the
refilled pit.  After establishment, the most
rigorous one is retained which is field-budded
subsequently.
Seedling and budded stumps: Planting of
seedling and budded stumps should be done
immediately after pulling out.  While planting
budded stumps, the bud patch should be just
above the ground level to reduce the effect of
elephant foot and infection by soil-borne

pathogens. A hole with depth equal to the
length of tap root is made at the centre of the
pit.  After leveling the soil, the stump is placed
in the hole with its tap root and lateral roots
spread out in proper position so that the tip of
the root is in contact with bottom soil and no
air gap is left in between.  The hole is then
filled and the soil around the stump is packed
firmly with the help of a crowbar.
Polybag plants:  At the time of planting, the
top whorl of leaves of the plant should be fully
mature.  A planting hole slightly bigger than
the size of the polybag is made.  The tip of the
tap root if grown out of the bag should be
removed.  The bottom of the bag is cut and
the bag along with the plant is placed in the
hole, gradually filling the hole with the soil core
intact.  The cut is continued as the bag is slit
open and carefully removed. The soil is finally
packed firmly around the plants.
Root trainer plants: At the time of planting,
the root plug can be separated from the
container without any damage by inverting it
and giving a gentle tap of the rim of the root
trainer on any hard surface.  A planting hole
can be made in the refilled planting pit by
pressing the empty root trainer container into
soil.  The root plug is carefully inserted into
the planting hole and the soil around is
compacted.  The root trainer plants show early
establishment due to its well-developed root
system.
Mulching, shading, irrigation and
whitewashing: The soil around the plants
should be mulched properly before the onset
of summer to conserve soil moisture, maintain
optimum soil temperature and control weed
growth.  Young plants during the year of
planting are provided with artificial shade
during summer with plated coconut leaves or
gunny bags.  From the second year onwards,
brown portion of the main stem is whitewashed
using lime or china clay to prevent sun
scorching till the  canopy develop partial shade.
Cover crops: Cover crops are established
and maintained in rubber plantation for
conserving soil and improving or maintaining
soil structure and fertility.  Fast growing
leguminous creepers, having the ability  to fix
atmospheric nitrogen in addition to other
attributes common to all cover plants like
suppressing weed growth, reducing soil
temperature etc., are widely used as cover
crops in rubber.  The common cover crops
established in rubber plantations are Pueraria
phaseoloides and Mucuna bracteata.  Seeds
of cover crops have very hard seed coat which
delays or inhibits germination. Therefore, pre-
sowing treatment is done to ensure uniformity
and higher percentage of germination.
Weed control: The concept of weed
management in rubber plantation is to manage
the weeds in such a way that they do not
adversely affect the growth of rubber.
Complete eradication of the entire weed flora
from the field is not envisaged. Weeds can be
controlled by manual, chemical (using
herbicides) or mechanical (using weed cutters)
methods. Manual weeding and herbicide
application can also be done in rotation for
effective weed control and better environ-
mental safety.
Different herbicides are used depending
upon the type of weed for effective control.
Herbicide spraying is most effective when
done during sunny weather and in the absence
of wind. The post-emergent herbicides
effective in controlling weeds in rubber and
their dosage are furnished in Table 20.
Weed cutters offer ample scope for the
management of weeds in rubber plantations
and there is 40 – 50 per cent savings inweeding
cost over manual weeding.
RUBBER
86
Intercropping
Rubber is planted at a wide spacing and
hence sufficient land and light are available in
the inter-row areas during the initial years for
intercropping. Intercrops should be selected
based on slope of the land, light availability in
the plantation and marketability.
Guidelines for intercropping
1.
Intercrops should be selected based on
the slope of the land.  If the slope is less
than 5 per cent, any intercrop can be
cultivated.  If the slope is more than 5 per
cent, intercrops which require less soil
disturbance should be selected.  If the
slope is more than 25 per cent,
intercropping is not advised.  In such
plantations, cover crops should be
established. Tillage operations should be
restricted to minimum while inter cropping.
2.
During the first two years, light is not
limiting for intercropping and hence any
annual or short-term crop can be
cultivated. From third year onwards, light
availability in the interspaces decreases
and hence partially shade tolerant crops
like tuber crops may be cultivated.
3.
Intercrops should be planted at least
1.5 m away  from the base of rubber plant
and this distance should be maintained
during later year also.
4.
Manures and fertilizers should be
applied separately to rubber and intercrops
as per requirement of the crop. For
manuring intercrops, the recommen
dations given by the Kerala Agricultural
University should be followed. For
perennial intercrops, the dose of chemical
fertilizers can be reduced to 50 per cent
after 5 years.

5.
The residues of intercrops should be
retained in the field.
6.
Cover crops should be established along
with intercrops.
7.
The fertilizer application to intercrops will
affect soil nutrient status.  Hence after
intercropping, fertilizer application for
rubber should be done based on soil testing
to avoid nutrient imbalances.
Annual and short term intercrops
Banana, pineapple, tuber crops, ginger,
turmeric and diverse vegetable can be culti-
vated in young rubber plantations following the
guidelines.  Short duration vegetables like
amaranthus can be cultivated in mature rubber
plantation also during the wintering period.
Perennial crops
Shade tolerant perennial crops with canopy
underneath rubber viz., coffee, cocoa and
vanilla on Glyricidia standards can be cultivated
as intercrops without  adversely affecting
growth and yield of rubber and soil fertility from
the young phase onwards. Coffee and cocoa
can be established during the mature phase
also.  When perennial crops are cultivated with
rubber, yield will decrease after canopy closure
of rubber. Medicinal plants like aratha (Alpinia
calcarata), Karimkurinji (Strobilanthes
haenianus) and Chuvanna koduveli
(Plumbago rosea) also can be cultivated as
intercrops in mature rubber plantations.
Manuring
The general fertilizer recommendations for
rubber plantation of the traditional are provided
in Table 21. However, these are subject to
modifications for individual holdings based on
soil and leaf nutrient status, soil type, age of
the plantation, management practices followed,
etc. Application of compost/farm yard manure
enhances growth of  rubber and adds to fertility
of soil.
As zinc deficiency is commonly noticed
especially in young rubber, zinc sulphate
application @ 25 kg/ha or 50g/plant mixed with
equal quantity of farm yard manure or top soil
(for uniform distribution) two weeks after the
post monsoon fertilizer  application during the
year of planting is advocated as an ad hoc
recommendation.
Time and frequency of fertilizer
application
Fertilizer should be applied when there is
sufficient moisture in the soil.  However, heavy
rainfall period should be avoided to minimize
runoff and leaching losses. In the year of
planting, fertilizer application is done 2-3
months after planting ie., during September-
October. From second year onwards, the
fertilizers should be applied in two equal splits
during April-May (pre-monsoon) and
September-October (post-monsoon) when
there is enough moisture in the soil. For manure
rubber also, fertilizers can be applied in two
equal splits, first application after a period of
about 30 days after the onset of pre-monsoon
showers after ensuring the presence of prolific
feeder roots in the surface soil and second
application during September-October.
Method of application
During the first year, fertilizers should be
evenly distributed over a circular band of 30 cm
all around the base of young plant, leaving about
7 cm from the base and slightly forked into
the top 5 to 8 cm of soil. The plant bases should
then be immediately mulched.  The second
application (9 months after planting) should be
done in a circular band of 45 cm width leaving
15 cm around the plant base.  The applications
in subsequent years till the canopy of the rubber
plant closes should be made in circular bands
of steadily increasing width.

Once the canopy closes, fertilizers should
be applied in square or rectangular patches in
between four trees and gently forked in.
Where legume cover is present or where it
has died out leaving thick mulch, broadcasting
in the inter-row areas can be resorted to.
Discriminatory fertilizer recommendation
Fertilizer recommendation based on soil and
leaf analysis ensures site-specific fertilizer
application for rubber and is the most ideal
approach. This facility is available at the
Rubber Research Institute of India and also
at the  Regional Laboratories at Adoor,
Kanjirappally, Pala, Muvattupuzha, Thrissur,
Kozhikode and Nedumangadu.
Harvesting
Tapping
Latex is obtained from the bark of the
rubber tree by tapping, a process of controlled
wounding during which thin shavings of bark
are removed.  Both “Michie Golledge” knife
used in India as well as the draw knife or
‘Jebong’ knife common in Malaysia are
suitable for high and low level tapping and
higher tasks.
Marking, slope, direction of tapping cut
and latex regeneration
The tapping cut of budded trees should have
a slope of about 30o to the horizontal and for
seedling trees only about 25o, since the fairly
thick bark prevents spillage. The latex vessels
in the barn run at an angle of 3-5o to the right
and therefore a cut from high left to low right
will open more latex vessels.
Tapping depth, bark renewal and bark
consumption
Latex vessels are concentrated near the
cambium. Hence, high yield is obtained by
tapping to a depth of less than one millimeter
close to the cambium. Bark regeneration is
brought about by the activity of the cambium.
Bark shaving thickness should vary depending
on the frequency adopted.
Time of tapping and task
Tapping should commence early in the
morning as late tapping reduces the exudation
of latex.  Headlight can be used for visibility
during early morning tapping. Completion of
tapping and latex flow in the early hours (02.00
to 6.00 hrs.) is good for higher yield.  It is
particularly important during summer and in
wind-prone areas. The tapping task (number
of trees tapped on a day by one tapper) in
India is 300-400 trees.
Tapping system
Response to different tapping systems
varies from clone to clone.  For high yielding
clones (RRII 105, RRII 400 series clones, PB
260, PB 235 etc.), the trees are to be tapped
on half spiral third daily (S/2 d3) system.
Alternate daily tapping can be practiced only
for medium yielding clones (RRIM 600,
GT 1, PB 28/59 etc.).
Low frequency tapping (LFT)
Low Frequency Tapping (LFT) with yield
stimulation using ethephon (2-chloroethyl
phosphonic acid) can be practiced from the
first year of  tapping to reduce the cost of
tapping and increase productive life of trees
and timber volume. The LFT systems
recommended are of d3, d4 or d7 frequency.
Controlled Upward Tapping
Controlled Upward Tapping (CUT) is a
proven harvesting practice to achieve
sustainable high yield for long term from old
and senile trees. The combination of Low
Frequency Tapping with CUT from renewed
RUBBER
90
panel stage can increase the economic life of
trees up to 40 to 50 years. In general 30-50
per cent higher yield can be obtained for many
years under CUT.
The normal recommended CUT practice
in India is periodic panel changing ie, basal
panel tapping (S/2) with rain guard during  rainy
season, and CUT (S/4) on high panel during
non-rainy season.  The length of tapping cut
can be quarter spiral for CUT irrespective of
the girth of tree and its slope should be 45o.
For CUT, a modified long handled gouge knife
must be used so that the tapper can stand on
the ground and tap the high panel.
Tapping cut in the high panel can be
stimulated using 5 per cent ethephon following
lace application method.  For third daily (d3)
tapping of quarter spiral cut in the high panel,
monthly stimulation is enough for high yielding
clones (like RRII 105) and stimulation at once
in three weeks intervals is necessary for
medium yielding clones.
Rain guarding
A suitable device is fixed on the trunk just
above the tapping cut and flow of water
through the main trunk is channeled out. This
method is found to be effective to keep the
tapping cut and the bark below and above in
dry condition during the rainy season.  Chances
of bark rot are high when the trees are rain
guarded and tapping is continued during rainy
season.  Irrespective of the type of rain guard
used, regular panel washing using fungicide
(mancozeb 0.37%) at 10-15 days interval is
necessary to prevent incidence of panel
diseases. With the introduction of Low
Frequency Tapping, rain guarding is needed
even under low rainfall conditions. Types of
rain guards recommended are polythene skirt,
tapping shade and Guardian/Kissan rain guard.
Plant protection
Abnormal leaf fall (Phytophthora meadii)
Symptoms
During south west monsoon period, the
fruits rot.  Later, infected leaves fall in large
number prematurely either green or after
turning coppery red with a drop of latex
often coagulated in the centre of a black
lesion on the petiole.
Management
Prophylactic spraying of the foliage prior
to the onset of southwest monsoon with
1 per cent Bordeaux mixture (3000-4000
l ha-1) or oil based copper oxychloride (30-40
litres of COC-oil mixture per ha mixed in
1:5 proportion) is recommended.
Powdery mildew (Oidium heveae)
Symptoms
Prominently noticed on newly formed
tender flush during the defoliation period of
January-March. Tender leaves with ashy
coating curl, crinkle, edges roll inwards and fall
off leaving the petioles attached to the twigs
giving a broom stick appearance. In later stages
on older leaves white patches appear. Infected
flowers and fruits shed.
Management
For young plants, spray wettable sulphur
(2 g l-1) or carbendazim (1 g l-1) at fortnightly
intervals. For mature trees, dust with sulphur
3-5 rounds at weekly to fortnightly intervals.
Sulphur mixed with an inert material like talc
(70:30 mixture) is generally used @ 11-13 kg
ha-1 per round.
Corynespora leaf spot disease
(Corynespora cassiicola)
Symptom
The disease is prevalent in nurseries (Nov-
May) and mature plantations (Jan-May). Large
91
RUBBER
spots with brown margin and pale centre are
formed, which later fall off forming shot holes.
On mature trees, light green leaves during
refoliation are more susceptible.  Defoliation
and dieback of twigs are also noticed.
Management
Shading in nursery reduces incidence.
Spraying mancozeb (2 g l-1) or carbendazim (1
g l-1) or Bordeaux mixture 1 per cent is
recommended. In mature rubber, micronized
spraying with oil-dispersible copper oxy
chloride dispersed in spray oil (1:5 proportion)
at light green stage of leaves is effective. In
mature trees high volume spraying with
mancozeb 0.2 per cent, carbendazim 0.05 per
cent or Bordeaux mixture 1 per cent at 2-3
week intervals during refoliation is effective.
Micron spraying with oil dispersible mancozeb
70 per cent @ 7 kg dispersed in 40 l ha-1 spray
oil is also effective.
Pink disease (Corticium salmonicolor)
Symptom
Trees in the age group 3-12 years are highly
susceptible. The seat of infection is usually at
the fork region. White or pink coloured cob-
web mycelial growth form on the surface of
the bark with streaks of latex oozing out from
the lesion; resulting in rotting, drying up and
cracking up of the affected bark. The distal
portions of affected branches dry and dried
leaves remain on these branches.
Management
In high disease prone areas, the highly
susceptible clones can be treated as a
prophylactic measure with Bordeaux mixture
or Bordeaux paste. In the early stages of
infection, apply Bordeaux paste up to 30 cm
above and below the affected region. Thiram
(7.5 g l-1) in pidivyl, china clay and
water mixed in the proportion 1:2:4 by volume
is very effective for control.  Thiram (0.75 per
cent) mixed in petroleum wound-dressing
compounds like rubberkote, sopkote etc. is also
effective.
Regular inspection of trees during July to
September for detecting the infection is
recommended.  In severe cases, prune off and
burn the dried up branches.
Bark rot (Phytophthora spp.)
Symptoms
During rainy season, when trees are tapped,
depressions are formed in the tapping panel
due to localized rotting and drying of bark.
Black vertical lines running downward into the
tapping bark and upwards into the renewed
bark are noticed. The bark when renewed
becomes highly uneven.
Management
The tapping cut and nearby bark should be
washed with mancozeb (3.75 g l-1) or
phosphoric acid (0.08 per cent) at weekly
intervals. The rotten bark may be scraped off
and applied with fungicide and then
covered with petroleum wound-dressing
compound.
Other diseases are patch canker, dry rot,
Colletotrichum leaf spot disease, bird’s
eyespot, shoot rot, brown rot etc.
Pests
The pests associated with rubber are scale
insect, mealy bug, termite, cockchafer grub,
mite, snail, rat etc. Appropriate control
measures may be adopted after identifying the
pest.

SUGARCANE (Saccharum officinarum)
Sugarcane grows best in the tropical
regions, receiving a rainfall of 750-1200 mm.
Sugarcane grows well on medium heavy soils,
but can also be raised on lighter soils and heavy
clays, provided there is adequate irrigation.  The
soils should be well drained.
Season
The normal planting season is October-
December. Delay in planting reduces cane
yield.  The planting season for semi-arid tract
is from October-December and in deltaic
areas the ideal time is the first fortnight of
January. Planting should not be delayed
beyond February in the plains.  In hilly tracts
where sugarcane is cultivated under rainfed
conditions, planting should be done after
abatement of heavy rains.
Varieties
CoTI 1358 (Abhay): Tolerant to water logging
CoTI 1153 (Aromal): Suitable for flood prone
situations and have high sugar content suitable
for jaggery production
CO TI 88322 (Madhuri): Resistant to red rot
disease
Co 92175: Suitable for drought prone
situation
Co 740: For ratooning
Co 6907, Co 7405 and Cul 57/84 (Thiru-
madhuram): Red rot resistant, high sugar
content
Cul 527/85 (Madhurima): Resistant to red rot,
tolerant to drought and waterlogging
Co 88017 (Madhumathi): Resistant to red rot,
tolerant to drought and waterlogging
Preparation of land
Plough the land thrice length-wise and
breadth-wise and level properly.  Prepare
 furrows 25 cm deep and 75 cm apart for short
duration and 90 cm apart for medium
duration varieties.  In hilly tracts, prepare pits
in rows along the contour at spacing of 30 cm in
the row and 75 cm between the rows.  For
mid-late varieties, an inter-row spacing of
75 cm is recommended.
Selection of setts
Select top ends of mature, healthy
disease free canes up to 1/3 of total length and
cut into setts of three eye buds. The seed rate
is 40000-45000 setts per hectare.
Seed treatment
For control of fungus disease like red rot,
dip cut ends of setts in 0.25 per cent solution
of copper based fungicide.
Planting
Plant setts end to end in the furrow, with
the eye buds facing sideways and cover with
soil.  In the pit system, plant 2-3 setts in
each pit.
Manuring
Apply compost or cattle manure, 10 t ha-1 or
pressmud 5 t ha-1 or dolomite 500 kg ha-1 or
calcium carbonate 750 kg ha-1. In addition, the
following fertilizers as N:P2O5:K2O kg ha-1 are
also recommended.
Pandalam and Thiruvalla areas: 165: 82.5: 82.5
(Madhuri, Thirumadhuram, Madhurima and
Madhumathi )
Chittoor area
:
225:75:75
Newly cleared forest areas:
115:75:90
Apply organic manures such as compost/
cattle manure/pressmud as basal dose
preferably in furrows and mix well with soil
before planting.
In sugarcane tracts of Palakkad where sett
treatment with Azospirillum @ 500g ha-1
93
SUGARCANE
together with soil application 5 kg ha-1 is done,
sugarcane need be given only 175kg ha-1  N.
When Azospirillium and Phosphobacteria at
5 kg each per ha is integrated with  FYM 10t
ha–1, sugarcane need be given only
75 per cent of the recommended dose of N,
P2O5 and K2O (165:82.5:82.5) for deltaic
areas.
Apply lime or dolomite or calcium carbonate
in the field before final preparation of the land.
Apply N and K2O in two split doses, the
first 45 days after planting and the second
90 days after planting along with earthing up.
Do not apply N beyond 100 days after
planting.
Apply entire dose of phosphorus as basal
dressing. When pressmud at 10t ha-1 is
applied sugarcane grown in Palakkad need be
given only 50 per cent of the recommended
dose of P as rock phosphate.
In the black soil of Palakkad apply S at 60
kg ha-1 in the form of gypsum as a soil
ameliorant before the final land preparation.
Among the sources of sulphur, gypsum is
found to be beneficial in sugarcane.
After cultivation
When ratoon crop of sugarcane is trash
mulched @ 4t ha-1 the crop must be given only
100 per cent of the recommended dose of NPK
225:75:75 against the existing recommendation
of 125 per cent.
The crop should be weeded twice on
45 and 90 days after planting before
application of fertilizers.  First weeding is done
by digging on the ridges and by hand in the
furrows.  Care should be taken to see that the
furrows are not filled up while digging so that
tillering is not affected.  At the time of second
digging, the crop is partially earthed upto
arrest formation of late shoots.  With the
commencement of the south west monsoon,
final earthing up should be done to prevent
lodging. At this time, de-trashing is to be done
to prevent the possible germination of axillary
buds and to reduce pest infestation.  Prevent
lodging either by twisting of trash or by prop-
ping.
Weed control using herbicides
Apply oxyflurofen at 0.61 kg ai ha–1 as pre
emergent and at 60 DAP as post-emergent
application.
Apply metribuzen 1 kg ai ha-1 as pre-
emergent application followed by one hoeing
at 60 DAP while integrated weed management
is undertaken.
Intercropping
Under irrigated conditions, intercropping
with short duration pulse crop is recommended.
In such cases, sow the pulse crop on the ridges
one month in advance, so that the first inter-
cultivation is not hindered.  As a green ma-
nure, sun hemp can also be raised on the ridges.
Irrigation
Irrigate the crop 8-10 times depending upon
the availability of rains.  In Chittoor area, more
number of irrigations will be necessary.  In early
growth periods, irrigate the crop at more
frequent intervals.  However, avoid too much
moisture and water stagnation especially
during germination and early growth phases.
Alternate furrow with trash mulching could
economise the use of irrigation water to the
tune of 41 per cent during the formative phase
of spring planted sugarcane as compared to
all furrow irrigation with trash mulching.
Plant protection
Pests
The important pests of sugarcane found in
the state are early shoot borers, top shoot
SUGARCANE
94
borers, mealy bugs, white grubs, termites
and rats.
Management
Use pest free setts for planting.
Adhere to clean cultivation.
Use traps or poison baiting for
controlling rats.
Diseases
Red rot
The most characteristic symptom of the
disease is the drying up of the canes, which
when split open will show characteristic red
colouration of the internal tissues with
horizontal white patches and the typical foul
smell. The disease is mainly transmitted through
infected setts and flowing water and can be
checked only by prophylactic means which are
given below:
1.
Affected crop should be harvested as early
as possible to prevent loss in yield and
deterioration in quality and also to arrest
further spread of the disease.  The crop
residues should be completely burnt after
harvesting.
2.
When infection is noticed in the field, the
affected clumps should be uprooted and
burnt promptly.
3.
Infected crop should never be ratooned.
4.
Water should not be let into a healthy crop
from diseased areas and as far as possible,
the field may be kept free of standing
water by providing drainage channels.
5.
In severely affected areas sugarcane
should not be cultivated at least for one
season during which paddy and tapioca can
be cultivated.
6.
Seed setts should not be collected from
diseased crops and from diseased areas.
7.
Movement of seed materials from
diseased to healthy areas should be strictly
quarantined.
8.
Cultivate red rot resistant varieties.
9.
To control the fungal diseases, in
general, dip the cut ends of setts in
copper oxychloride 2 g l-1 solution before
planting.
Other transmissible diseases like grassy
shoot, ratoon stunting etc. can be controlled
by heat treatment and by implementing three
tier seed programme.
Harvesting
Harvest the crop when it is fully mature.
Delayed harvesting will reduce yield and
recovery percentage.
Ratoon management
Normally not more than two ratoon crops
are recommended. Stubble shaving should be
done with a sharp spade wherever the canes
are not cut close to the ground.
Spread the trash uniformly in sugarcane
field after stubble shaving and dismantling the
ridges.
Gap filling
Fill the gaps at the rate of one - three budded
sett for every 50 cm gap or with poly bag
settlings for every 50cm gap. Polybag settlings
are produced by planting single budded setts
in polythene covers containing potting mixture
and transplanted at 45-60 DAP.
Manuring of ratoon crop
Ratoon crop requires a higher dose of
nitrogen than the plant crop.  An extra dose of
25 per cent nitrogen is recommended.
Manure the crop by 25th and 75th days
after harvest of the previous crop. Entire quan-
tity of phosphorus, half of nitrogen and potash
are applied as the first dose and the remaining
as the second dose.  The first dose is incorpo-
rated into the soil by digging and the second
dose is applied around the clump and earthing
up is done.  Weeding is also done at this time.
Irrigation is given as in plant crop.

SUGARCANE
Coconut requires an equatorial climate with
high humidity. The ideal mean annual
temperature is 27oC with 5-7º diurnal variation.
The palm does not withstand prolonged spells
of extreme variations. A well-distributed
rainfall of 1300-2300 mm per annum is
preferred.
Coconut is grown in different soil types
such as laterite, coastal sandy, alluvial and also
in reclaimed soils of the marshy lowlands. It
tolerates salinity and a wide range of pH (from
5.0-8.0).
The cultural practices have to be adopted
to suit the varying climatic and soil conditions.
Selection of site
Select sites with deep (not less than
1.5 m depth) well drained soil. Avoid shallow
soils with underlying hard rock, low-lying areas
subject to water stagnation and heavy clayey
soils.

Selection of mother palms
Select mother palms having the following
characters:
1. Regular bearing habit and yielding not less
than 80 nuts / annum.
2. Age 20 years or more (5 years after
reaching full bearing capacity). If the
mother palms are the progeny of elite
planting material and gives consistently
higher yields for a period of not less than
6 years, seed nuts can be collected from
such palms. There is no need for insisting
20 years as minimum age for mother
palms in such conditions.
3. More than 30 fully opened leaves with
short strong petioles and wide leaf base
firmly attached to the stem.
4. Bearing at least 12 bunches of nuts with
strong bunch stalks.
5. Bearing nuts of medium size and oblong
shape.
6. Husked nuts should weigh not less than
600 g.
7. Mean copra content of 150 g per nut or
more.
Avoid palms which (i) have long, thin and
pendulous inflorescence stalks (ii) produce
long, narrow, small sized or barren nuts (iii)
show shedding of immature nuts in large
numbers and (iv) are grown under favourable
environmental conditions.
Collection and storage of seed nuts
Collect mature nuts (above 11 month old)
during the period from December to May.
Lowering of bunches by means of ropes may
be done when the palms are tall and ground is
hard. Discard nuts, which show improper
development or other undesirable features.
Store seeds in shade for a minimum period of
60 days prior to sowing in nursery. For storing,
arrange the seed nuts with the stalk-end up
over an 8 cm layer of sand in a shed and cover
with sand to prevent drying of nut water. Up
to five layers of nuts can be arranged one over
the other. The nuts can also be stored in plots,
provided the soil is sandy and the ground is
sufficiently shaded. In the case of nuts
harvested in May, heap them in partial shade,
till husk is well dried and then sow them in the
nursery.
Selection and preparation of site for
nursery
Nursery sites should be well drained with
light textured soil and with adequate but not
too much shade. In open areas, provide shade
during summer. Prepare beds of 1.5 m width
and of convenient length with 75 cm space
between beds. In areas where drainage is poor,
prepare raised beds.
Before sowing, examine seed nuts and
discard those without nut water and rotten
kernels. Sow the nuts in the nursery after
commencement of southwest monsoon during
May-June.
Spacing of nuts
Plant the seed nuts at a spacing of 30 cm
(between rows) x 30 cm (between nuts) with
four or five rows per bed.
Method of planting seed nuts
Plant the seed nuts in the beds in trenches
25-30 cm deep and cover with soil so that top
97
COCONUT
portion of husk alone is visible. The nuts may
be planted either horizontally with the widest
of the segments at the top or vertically with
stalk-end up. Vertical planting is preferable on
account of convenience in transporting and
lesser risk of seedling injury.
Care and management of nursery
Provide protective fencing to the nursery
if it is located in open area. If the soil is sandy,
provide mulching immediately after the
cessation of monsoon rain. Irrigate the nursery
once in two days during summer months. Keep
the nursery beds free of weeds by periodic
weeding. If termite is noticed, remove soil in
the affected area upto a depth of about 15 cm
and dust soil and nuts with carbaryl or
chlorpyrifos. Repeat if attack persists.
Periodically spray the plants with 1per cent
bordeaux mixture or any other copper fungicide
to prevent fungal infection.
Selection of seedlings
Remove seed nuts, which do not germinate
within 6 months after sowing as well as those
with dead sprouts. Select only good quality
seedlings (9-12 months old) by a rigorous
selection based on the following characte-
ristics.
1. Early germination, rapid growth and
seedling vigour.
2. Six to eight leaves for 10-12 months old
seedlings and at least four leaves for 9
months old seedlings.
3. Collar girth of 10-12 cm.
4. Early splitting of leaves.
Note: The recovery of quality seedlings will
be about 60-65 per cent. Since early
germination is one of the criteria for the
selection of seedlings, the storing and
sowing of seed nuts should be in lots
rather than in a staggered manner.
Removal of seedlings
Remove seedlings from the nursery by
lifting with spade and cutting the roots. Keep
the seedlings in shade and do not expose to
sun. Plant seedlings as early as possible after
removal from nursery. Never allow lifting the
seedlings from the soil by pulling the leaves or
stem.
Preparation of land and planting of
seedlings
The nature of preparation of land before
planting depends upon topography of land, soil
type and other environmental factors. On
slopes and in areas of undulating terrain,
prepare the land by contour terracing or
bunding. In low-lying areas and rice fields, form
mounds to a height of at least 1 m above water
level. In reclaimed kayal areas, planting can
be done on the field bunds.
The size of pits for planting would depend
upon soil types and water table. In loamy soils
with low water table, pit size of 1m x 1m x
1 m is recommended. In laterite soils with
underlying rock, take larger pits of size 1.2 m
x 1.2 m x 1.2 m. In sandy soils, the size of pits
may be 0.75 m x 0.75 m x 0.75 m. The pits
may be filled up with top soil to a height 60 cm
below the ground level.  In low lying lands,
take shallow pits and  as the plant grows, raise
the ground level by adding silt and sand so as
to cover the entire bole of the palm. The same
procedure can be adopted when planting
is done on mounds or bunds. Burial of
two layers of husks in  the pits will be useful
for moisture conservation. The husk
is to be buried in layers with concave surface
facing upwards.
COCONUT
98
Note: In lateritic areas, common salt
@ 2 kg per pit may be applied on the
pit to improve soil conditions. Common
salt is to be applied about six months
prior to planting.
Spacing
Spacing depends upon the planting system,
soil type etc. In general, spacings are
recommended under different systems in
sandy and laterite soils as given in Table 22.
In lateritic gravelly soils, under rainfed
conditions of north Kerala, a closer spacing to
accommodate 250 palms per ha is more
economical.
In the hedge system of planting, the rows
should be aligned in north-south direction and
the seedlings planted as in the triangular
system.
Time of planting
Planting the seedlings during May, with the
onset of pre-monsoon rains is ideal. Under
assured irrigation, planting can be done during
April also. In low-lying areas, plant the
seedlings in September after the cessation of
heavy rains.
Shading and irrigation
For the first two years from planting, irrigate
@ 45 litres of water per seedling, once in 4
days, during dry summer months. Provide
adequate shade to the transplanted seedlings.
Manuring young palms
For the first three years after planting under
rainfed conditions, apply fertilizers in two split
doses at the rates shown in Table 23. Fertilizer
requirement of adult palms is given in
Table 24.

Note: Under irrigated conditions, the fertilizers

In the case of low lying areas, apply
fertilizer after water table recedes in one
single dose or in two split doses as
conditions permit. In all types of soils
that are low in organic matter content
(except reclaimed clayey soils and
alluvial soils), apply organic matter @
of 15-25 kg per palm per year during
June-July from the second year of
planting.
Weeding and interculture
Keep the pits free of weeds by periodical
weeding. Remove the soil covering the collar
of seedlings. As the seedlings grow fill up the
pits gradually by cutting the sides. Proper
intercultivation provides control of weeds and
creates soil mulch. Any tillage system
(ploughing, digging, raking or forming mounds)
that provides soil mulch and control weeds may
be followed depending upon local conditions.
For laterite, sandy and red sandy loam soils
give two ploughings or diggings in May-June
and September-October and one raking in
January. In areas where surface run off is
more, form mounds in September-October and
level them in November-December.
Drought management in coconut gardens
Coconut produces nuts round the year.
Therefore, adequate supply of water is
essential for its proper growth. Soil moisture
is essential for the absorption of nutrients by
roots. Moisture stress leads to stunted growth,
drooping of leaves, immature nut fall and
decreased yield. Importance may be given on
the following aspects so as to ward off stress:
1. Husk burial for moisture conservation
Burying of fresh or dried coconut husk
around the palm is a desirable practice
particularly for moisture retention. The husk
can be buried either in linear trenches taken
3 m away from the trunk between rows of
palms or in circular trenches taken around the
palm at a distance of 2 m from the trunk. The
trenches may be of 0.5 m width and depth.
The husks are to be placed in layers with
concave surface facing upwards and covered
with soil. The beneficial effect of husk burial
will last for about 5-7 years. Instead of husk, coir
pith can be buried @ 25 kg per palm per year.
2. Mulching
Mulching is an effective method of
conserving soil moisture. Mulch the coconut
basins with green / dry leaves at the close of
Table 24. Fertilizer recommendation for coconut

northeast monsoon (October-November).
Mulching also adds organic matter to the soil
and reduces the soil temperature. Do not
disturb soil in the coconut garden during
summer months. In level lands, during rainy
seasons excess water may be conserved in
small trenches dug out in the plantation. In
sloppy areas, land may be terraced and
trenches dug across. This will facilitate
maximum percolation of rainwater and water
conservation. For moisture conservation,
lowermost 3-5 leaves may be cut and removed.
Provide adequate shade for the transplanted
seedlings for 1-2 years. To minimize the sun
scorch on the srunk, application of lime solution
on the trunk up to a height of 2-3 m at the start
of the summer season is recommended.
3. Green manure and cover crops
Green manure and cover crops recom-
mended for cultivation in coconut gardens are:
a. Green manure crops: Crotalaria juncea
(sunhemp), Tephrosia purpurea (kolinji),
Indigofera hirsuta, Pueraria phaseoloides
b. Cover crops: Calapagonium muconoides,
Mimosa invisa, Stylosanthes gracilis
c. Shade-cum-green manure shrub:
Tephrosia candida
Sow cowpea seeds more towards the
periphery of basins taken at a radius of 2.0m
from the base of the palm for green manure
during April-May with the onset of pre-
monsoon rains.  When a few plants start
flowering, uproot the entire plants and
incorporate into the soil during August-
September and cover the basins with soil.
Sow green manure and cover crop seeds
during April-May with the onset of pre-
monsoon rains. The green manure crops
should be ploughed in and incorporated into
the soil during August-September. This will
increase the water holding capacity of soil.
Calapagonium can be grown either as green
manure or cover crop. Tephrosia is especially
suited for planting around seedling pits for
summer shade and as a source of green
manure in the rainy season.
Manuring of adult palms
The nutrient dosages recommended for
adult palms are given in Table 24.
1. Under irrigated conditions, fertilizers can
be applied in 3-4 equal split doses.
2. In the case of low-lying areas, apply
fertilizers in one single dose after water
table recedes or in two split doses as
conditions permit.
3. The application of organic materials such
as forest leaves, cattle manure, coir dust
or coconut shredding at 10 kg per pit in the
first three years and 15-25 kg thereafter
will be useful to obtain better establishment
of coconut palms in sandy soils and in
coastal situations.
4. In situations where the available P2O5
status of the soil is more than 10 ppm,
application of phosphatic fertilizers can be
skipped for a few years until the status of
P2O5 reaches 10 ppm.
5. For sandy and sandy loams of Onattukara
and similar situations and also for hybrid
palms grown in root (wilt) affected areas,
apply 500 g N + 300 g P2O5 + 1000 g K2O
along with 500 g MgSO4 per palm per year.
6. Application of MgSO4 to coconut palms
earlier confined to root wilt affected areas
is recommended for the whole state.
7. The N:P2O5:K2O recommendation given
for high yielding palms is, in general,
sufficient for palms yielding upto 100 nuts
per year. For palms yielding more than 100
nuts per year, an additional dose of 10 g N,
101
COCONUT
5 g P2O5 and 15 g K2O may be supplied for
every nut exceeding 100 nuts .
8. In laterite soils, 50 per cent of the K2O
requirement of coconut can be substituted
by Na2O supplied in the form of sodium
chloride.
Time, frequency and method of fertilizer
application
Under rainfed conditions, apply fertilizers
in two split doses, 1/3 at the time of early
southwest monsoon showers in April-June and
2/3 in September-October.
Under irrigated conditions, apply fertilizers
in three or four equal doses in April-May,
August-September, December and February-
March.
Apply lime or dolomite during April-May,
magnesium sulphate during August-September
and organic matter during June-July. For an
adult palm 1.0 kg dolomite or 1.0 kg lime + 0.5
kg MgSO4  is required per annum.
Apply fertilizers and manures in circular
basins at a radius of 2.0 m from the base of
the palm and 10 cm deep, opened after the
onset of southwest monsoon. Split doses can
be applied with irrigation water in summer
months.
Recycling of palm waste
Recycling of palm waste is very much
beneficial especially for maintaining the
availability status of micronutrients and trace
elements. Palm wastes like coconut leaves,
crown waste, dried spathes, husk etc. may be
deposited in a small trench of convenient
length, 0.5 m to 0.75 m wide and 0.3 to
0.5 m deep at a distance of 2-2.5 m away from
the base of the trunk. Fill up this trench with
the palm wastes along one side of the palm
(north) in one year, opposite side (south) in
the next year, east in the third year and so on.
This practice of organic recycling of waste
has been found to improve the growth and
productivity of the palms.
Intercropping and mixed cropping
Schedules for inter/mixed cropping may be
drawn up based on the canopy size, age and
spacing of palms. In general, palms in the age
group of 8-25 years are not suitable for inter
and mixed cropping. However, cereals and
tapioca are recommended as intercrops in
young coconut plantation upto 3-4 years. Since
ginger and turmeric are shade tolerant crops
with shallow roots, they can be intercropped
in coconut garden even in the age group of
15-25 years. It ensures better land utilization,
solar energy harvesting, efficient water use,
utilization of soil nutrient resources, more
returns and an insurance against crop failure.
Under conditions of wider spacing i.e. beyond
7.6 m, intercropping is possible irrespective of
the age of the palms.
The following crops are recommended as
intercrops.
Cereals: Rice, maize
Legumes and pulses: Groundnut, horse
gram, cowpea.
Tubers: Tapioca, sweet potato, yams,
colocasia.
Spices and condiments: Ginger, turmeric,
chilly, pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove.
Fruit plants: Banana, pineapple, papaya.
(Banana 
variety 
Palayankodan 
is
recommended in the reclaimed soils of
Kuttanad. Three suckers per clump have to
be retained).
Beverage crop: Cocoa
Fodder grasses: Hybrid Napier, guinea
grass.
In all cases, separate application of
adequate fertilizers and manures to the
individual crop is essential.

Irrigation
Irrigate the palms during summer
months in basins around palms as shown in
Table 25 & 26.
Note: In coastal sandy soils, seawater can be
used for irrigation. In irrigated gardens,
interruption of irrigation would lead to
serious set back in yield and general
condition of palms. Hence, when once
started, irrigation should be continued
regularly and systematically. In sandy
loam soil, irrigating the crop with 500
litres of water through basin taken at
1.5 m radius at CPE value of 50 mm
(approximate interval of 15 days) is
most economical. Do not irrigate
seedlings and very young palms with
seawater.
Drip irrigation
In the traditional system of irrigation
followed in coconut gardens such as flood
irrigation, basin irrigation etc. irrigation
efficiency is only 30 to 50 per cent due to
considerable wastage of water. In addition, cost
on inputs like labour and energy in adopting
these systems are high. Scarcity of water and
increasing cost of labour and energy are
deterrents in adopting these traditional irrigation
systems. Under these circumstances, drip

irrigation is the most suitable system of
irrigation to coconut. Some of the major
advantages of drip irrigation are: it saves water,
enhances plant growth and yield, saves energy
and labour, most suited for soils having low
water holding capacity and undulating terrain,
reduces weed growth and improves efficiency
of fertilizers. For coconut, generally, three to
four drippers are given per palm. The water
requirement for an adult palm is 40 to 50 litres
per day.
D x T hybrid production
The following guidelines are suggested for
large scale production of D x T hybrid
seedlings. Assisted pollination should be done
to get maximum hybrid nut production. As far
as possible use prepotent palms as parents in
the hybridization programmes.
Selection of mother palms
Palms with the following phenotypic
character combination may be selected for
hybridization work.
1. Nuts without ridges and having yellow,
orange or red colour.
2. Palms with overlapping female and male
phases.
3. Small crown and canopy compared to that
of tall palm.
4. Narrow stem without any bulging at the
base with close leaf scars.
Hybridization
1. Use mixed pollen from identified tall palms.
2. Emasculate the inflorescence by cutting the
male flowers with scissors and stripping if
necessary within 5-7 days of opening the
spathe.
3. Cloth bags made of very close mesh should
be used for covering the inflorescence.
4. Hairy caterpillar larvae cause serious
damage by boring into the female flowers
and developing buttons through stigmatic
ends. The damage is more serious under
bagged conditions.
5. Dusting of pollen-talc mixture in 1:9
proportion using pollen dispensers is
recommended.
6. Assisted pollination for at least 3-5 days
on each inflorescence till last female flower
becomes receptive and fully pollinated.
7. Remove bags after the seventh day of
pollination of the last female flower.
Nursery
The nuts should be harvested before it is
tree-ripe and sown immediately in the bed
*NBSSLUP classification (Nair et al., 2012).
** The lower values are for sandy soils and higher values are for clayey soils. Intermediate values can be chosen
based on the texture of the soil with values moving towards lower side for increasing sand content and vice versa
for increasing clay content. Add 30 to 40% to the above values depending upon the conveyance and application
efficiencies in irrigation.

without storage. Nursery beds should be
mulched or shaded and watered regularly and
adequately.
Button shedding
The shedding of buttons in the coconut is
attributed to the following reasons.
1. Pathological conditions
2. Attack of insect pests
3. Nutritional deficiencies
4. Soil and climatic variations
5. Defects in pollination and fertilization
6. Structural defects in the flower
7. Abortion of embryos
8. Limited capacity of the tree to bear fruits
9. Unfavourable conditions such as deficit of
moisture, waterlogging and lack of aeration.
The causes of button shedding may be
identified and appropriate remedial measures
adopted.
Plant protection
Pests
Rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros)
Symptoms
The adult beetle bores into the unopened
fronds and spathes. The attacked frond when
fully opened shows characteristic triangular
cuts.
Management
1. Provide field sanitation to prevent breeding
of beetles.
2. Hook out the beetles from the attacked
palms by using beetle hook.
3. The topmost three leaf axils around the
spindle may be filled with any of the
following mixtures as a prophylactic
measure:
a. Application of 250 g neem cake or marotti
(Hydnocarpus wightina) cake mixed
with equal volume of sand in the
innermost 2-3 leaf axils. This treatment
is to be done twice, ie., during April-May
before the onset of south-west monsoon
and during September-October after the
south-west monsoon.
b. Naphthalene balls 12.0 g (approx.
4 nos.) in the innermost 2 leaf axils and
covered with fine sand, once in 45 days.
c. Incorporation of Clerodendron
infortunatum @ 10 per cent w/w basis in
the cowdung pit and/or manure pits.
4. Crown cleaning followed by the application
of 20g Cartap hydrochloride 4G or Fipronil
0.3G or carbosulfan 6G mixed with 200 g
sand in the innermost 2-3 leaf axils. This
treatment has to be done thrice during
January, May and September.
5. Release Baculovirus oryctes infected
adults @ 10-15 ha-1 to bring down the pest
population.
6. Inoculation of breeding sites with
entomopathogenic fungus Metarrhizium
anisopliae (@ 5 x 1011 spores / m3) var
major causes mortality to the grubs.
Red palm weevil
(Rhyncophorus ferrugineus)
Symptoms
The diagnostic symptoms are the presence
of holes on the stem, oozing out of a viscous
brown fluid and extrusion of chewed up fibrous
matter through the hole, longitudinal splitting
of leaf base and wilting of central shoot.
Sometimes the gnawing sound produced by
the feeding grubs inside will also be audible.
Management
1. Field sanitation should be given prime
importance.
2. Avoid making steps or any other injury on
the tree trunks to reduce the loci of
infestation.
105
COCONUT
3. Leaf axil filling as suggested in the case of
rhinoceros beetle will be useful against the
red palm weevil also.
4. When green leaves are cut from the palms,
stumps of not less than 120 cm may be left
on the trees in order to prevent successful
inward movement of the grubs through the
cut end.
5. In attacked palms, observe for the bore-
holes and seal them except the top most
one. Through the top most hole, pour
1 per cent carbaryl or 0.15 per cent
trichlorphon suspension @ one litre per
palm, using a funnel.
6. When the pest infestation is through the
crown, clean the crown and slowly pour
the insecticidal suspension.
7. As an alternative, apply 1 per cent DDVP
as a curative measure.
8. Coconut log traps with fermenting toddy
or pineapple or sugarcane activated with
yeast or molasses can be set in coconut
plantation to attract and trap the free
floating population of red palm weevil.
Incorporate any of the insecticide to each
trap to kill the weevils trapped.
9. Use of pheromone trap for attracting and
killing adult weevils @ one trap per 2 ha.
Leaf eating caterpillar (Opisina arenosella)
Symptoms
The caterpillar feeds on green matter from
the lower leaf surface, remaining within
galleries of silk and frass. The attack will be
severe during summer months from January-
May.
Management
1. As a prophylactic measure, the first
affected leaves may be cut and burnt during
the beginning of the summer season.
2. Arrange for the release of larval / pupal
parasitoids, Goniozus nephantidis,
Elasmus nephantidis (brown species) and
Brachymeria nosatoi.
3. Trunk release of G.nephantidis @ 10 nos/
plam (4 to 6 releases) is effective for the
management of leaf eating caterpillar.
4. When infestation is very severe and if the
biocontrol is not likely to be effective, spray
the undersurface of the fronds with
dichlorvos 0.05 per cent, malathion
0.1 per cent, quinalphos 0.05 per cent or
phosalone 0.07 per cent.
5. When the infestation is very severe and if
the biocontrol is not likely to be effective,
spray the under surface of the fronds with
dichlorvos 0.05 per cent, malathion 0.1 per
cent, quinalphos 0.05 per cent, phosalone
0.07 per cent, Flubendiamide 39.35 SC (0.2
ml l-1), Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC (0.5
ml l-1). Spinosad 45 SC (0.4 ml l-1) is also
effective.
Note: Application of the insecticides should
be followed by liberation of larval and
pupal parasites from the 21st day.
Cockchafer beetle
(Leucopholis coneophora)
Symptoms
The soil inhabiting white grubs cause
damage to the roots of coconut palm. The
attack is common in sandy tracts. The infested
palms turn pale yellow and there will be
considerable reduction in yield.
Management
1.
Collection and destruction of adults during
the monsoon period from adjacent
vegetation (in the evening).
2.
Plough or dig the infested soil synchro-
nizing with pre-monsoon showers.
3.
Drench the soil with chlorpyrifos 0.04 per
cent  suspension. The treatment should
be given twice, first during April-May after
the receipt of pre-monsoon showers and
second during the month of September.
Note: Wherever possible, light traps may be
set up to attract and trap adult beetles.
COCONUT
106
Coreid bug (Paradasynus rostratus)
Symptoms
The attacked buttons become deformed
with characteristic crevices on the husk below
the perianth with gum exudations and the
tender nuts become barren.
Management
Apply 0.1 per cent Dimethoate 0.05% on
the newly opened inflorescence after the
receptive phase of the female flowers and
spray the entire crown excluding the leaves
and older bunches.
Note: The insecticide may be applied
according to the severity of infection
in a need-based manner.
Coconut eriophyid mite
(Aceria guerreronis)
It is a microscopic worm like mite infesting
young buttons colonizing under the perianth.
Symptoms
The earliest symptoms on 2-3 months old
button  is pale yellow triangular patches seen
below the perianth. Later, these patches
become brown. Severely affected buttons may
fall. As the buttons grow, brown patches lead
to black necrotic lesions with longitudinal
fissures on the husk. Uneven growth results
in distortion and stunting of nuts leading to
reduction in copra yield. In severe cases, the
losses are compounded because the quality of
fibre is reduced and distorted nuts increase
the labour requirements for dehusking.
Management
1. Collect and destroy all the fallen buttons of
the affected palm.
2. Apply 2 per cent  neem oil + garlic emulsion
or commercial neem formulation
azadirachtin 0.004 per cent (Neemazal T/
S 1 per cent @ 4 ml per litre of water) or
micronized wettable sulphur 0.4 per cent
in the crown on young bunches. When
rocker sprayer is used 1.0 to 1.5 litres of
spray fluid per palm is required. If a hand
sprayer is used, the spray solution required
may be about 500 to 750 ml. Spraying has
to be done on second to seventh bunches
from top avoiding unpollinated inflore-
scence. Care should be taken to see that
spray fluid reaches the perianth region of
third, fourth and fifth bunches since these
bunches harbour maximum number of
mites. Three rounds of spraying are
recommended in a year viz., March-April
before the onset of southwest monsoon, in
August-September during the dry spell
between the southwest and northeast
monsoons and in December-January after
the northeast monsoon so that all the
emerging bunches in the vulnerable stage
receive one round of spraying. Rational
rotation of the above pesticides may be
adopted to avoid chances of resistance.
Preparation of neem oil + garlic emulsion
(2 per cent)
To prepare 10 litres of 2 per cent neem
oil + garlic emulsion, 200 ml neem oil, 200 g
garlic and 50 g ordinary bar soap are required.
Slice the bar soap and dissolve in 500 ml
lukewarm water. Grind 200 g of garlic and take
the extract in 300 ml of water. Pour the 500
ml soap solution in 200 ml neem oil slowly and
stir vigorously to get a good emulsion. Mix the
garlic extract in the neem oil + soap emulsion.
Dilute this 1 litre stock solution by adding
9 litres of water to get 10 litres of 2 per cent
neem oil + garlic emulsion.
As per the recommendation of the National
Level Steering Committee, a holistic approach
has to be adopted in the management of the
coconut eriophyid mite. Hence, in addition to
the plant protection measures mentioned
above, the following measures can be adopted:
1.
Improving nutrient status by applying
organic manure at the rate of 50 kg and
neem cake 5 kg per palm per year. Also
apply the recommended dose of fertilizers
in two split applications.
2.
Growing compatible intercrops / mixed
crops.
3.
Providing adequate irrigation.

COCONUT
Mealy bug
Symptoms
Mealy bugs infest the unopened heartleaf
and inflorescence. As a result, the leaves
become highly stunted, suppressed, deformed
and present a crinkled appearance. It is often
confused with the leaf rot symptoms. The
affected inflorescences are malformed and do
not open. Even if they open, they do not bear
nuts.
Button mealy bugs colonize under the
perianth lobes of tender nuts. Infested nuts
harbouring gravid mealy bugs remain on the
spadix, which serve as inoculum for further
spread.
Management
Remove and destroy all dried up
inflorescence and unproductive buttons. Apply
non-residual phosphatic insecticide dimethoate
0.05 per cent or quinalphos 0.05 per cent at
the site of infestation. Neem garlic emulsion 2
per cent applied on infested bunches checks
button mealy bugs.
Rodents
Rats damage tender nuts by forming
characteristic holes. Shed nuts can be seen at
the base of the palm.
Place wax blocks of 0.005 per cent
bromadiolone in coconut crown of the infested
palms at 3 to 4 days interval till the bait is no
more consumed.
Diseases
Phytophthora diseases
Phytophthora palmivora has been found
to affect seedlings and adult palms causing bud
rot and immature nut fall commonly known as
mahali.
Bud rot
Symptoms
Palms of all age are liable to be attacked
but normally young palms are more susceptible,
particularly during monsoon when the
temperature is low and humidity is very high.
In seedlings, the spear leaf turns pale and
comes off with a gentle pull. In adult palms,
the first visible symptom is the colour change
of the spear, which becomes pale and breaks
at the base and hangs down. The tender leaf
base and soft tissues of the crown rot into a
slimy mass of decayed material emitting a foul
smell. The rotting slowly progresses
downwards, finally affecting the meristem and
killing the palms. This is accompanied by
drooping of successive leaves. Even then, nuts
that are retained on the palm may grow to
maturity. The disease proves fatal if not
checked at the early stages, before damage
of the bud.
Management
1.
In early stages of the disease (when the
heartleaf starts withering) cut and remove
all affected tissues of the crown. Apply
Bordeaux paste and protect it from rain
till normal shoot emerges.
2.
Burn all disease-affected tissues removed
from the palm.
3.
Spray 1.0 per cent Bordeaux mixture on
spindle leaves and crown of disease
affected as well as neighbouring palms,
as a prophylactic measure. Palms that are
sensitive to copper containing fungicides
can be protected by mancozeb. Small,
perforated sachets containing 2 g of
mancozeb may be tied to the top of leaf
axil. When it rains, a small quantity of the
fungicide is released from the sachets to
the leaf base, thus protecting the palm.
4.
Adopt control measures for rhinoceros
beetle.
5.
Provide adequate drainage in gardens.
6.
Adopt proper spacing and avoid over
crowding in bud rot prone gardens.
Mahali
Symptoms
Shedding of female flowers and immature
nuts are the common symptoms of the disease.
Lesions appear on the young fruits or buttons
COCONUT
108
near the stalk, which later lead to the decay of
the underlying tissues and endosperm.
Management
Spray 1.0 per cent Bordeaux mixture or
copper oxychloride preparation (2 g l-1) on the
crown of palms, once before the monsoon and
once or twice later on at intervals of 40 days.
Root (wilt) disease
Symptoms
The characteristic symptom is the flaccidity
of leaflets. Yellowing of older leaves, necrosis
of leaflets and deterioration and decay of root
system are other salient features of the disease.
The leaflets curve inwardly to produce ribbing
so that the whole frond develops a cup like
appearance. Abnormal shedding of buttons and
immature nuts are also noticed.
Management
Coconut root (wilt) is a non-lethal
debilitating disease and the affected palms
survive for a long period giving a reasonably
good yield. The root (wilt) affected palms are
susceptible to diseases like leaf rot and pests
like rhinoceros beetle and red palm weevil. So
there is a chance of confusing the pests and
disease symptom with the root (wilt) disease.
Negligence on the management aspects
aggravates the malady. Efficient management
of palms suspected to be affected by coconut
root (wilt) disease demands control of all pests
and diseases and imparting natural resistance
and health to the palms through proper
manuring and agronomic practices. A package
of management practices for the effective
management of root (wilt) disease is given
below:
1.
Rogue out palms that are affected
severely by root (wilt) and yield less than
10 nuts / palm / year and those, which
have contracted the disease before
flowering. Replant with disease tolerant
material / high yielding hybrids
(Chandrasankara).
2.
Apply fertilizers for coconut palms in
average management at the rate of 0.34
kg N, 0.17 kg P2O5 and 0.68 kg K2O /
palm / year in the form of urea, rock
phosphate and muriate of potash,
respectively. For palms under good
management, fertilizers may be given @
of 0.5 kg N, 0.32 kg P2O5 and 1.2 kg
K2O / palm / year.
3.
In addition to the above, apply 50 kg cattle
manure or green manure and 1 kg of
lime/palm/year. Magnesium may be
supplied @ 500 g MgO per palm per year
in the Onattukara region (sandy soil) and
100 g MgO in the remaining areas. The
cheapest source of MgO is magnesite
(MgCO3). The magnesium in magnesite
is acid soluble. Hence it may be preferred
in acid soils.
4.
Growing green manure crops like
sun hemp, sesbania, cowpea and
calapagonium in the coconut basin and
their incorporation in situ is beneficial as
the practice reduces the intensity of the
root (wilt) and increases the nut yield. The
ideal green manure crops for the sandy
and alluvial soils are cowpea and sesbania,
respectively.
5.
Under rainfed conditions, apply fertilizers
in two splits, 1/3rd at the time of early
southwest monsoon and 2/3rd before the
northeast monsoon. Under irrigated
conditions apply fertilizers in three equal
splits (April-May, August-September and
December-January).
6.
Apply fertilizers and manures in 10 cm
deep circular basins at a radius of 2 m
from the bole of the palm.
7.
When the crop is grown under the bund
and channel system, desilt the channel and
strengthen the bunds during summer
months.
8.
Follow strictly all the prescribed
prophylactic measures against leaf rot
109
COCONUT
disease, red palm weevil, rhinoceros
beetle etc. so as to ensure that the palms
are not debilitated. To maintain the
productivity of the palms, prophylactic
measures are of great importance.
Leaf rot
Symptoms
The first symptom is the appearance of
water-soaked brown lesions in the spear leaves
of root-wilt affected palms. Gradually these
spots enlarge and coalesce resulting in
extensive rotting. As the leaf unfurls, the rotten
portions of the lamina dry and get blown off in
wind, giving a ‘fan’ shape to the leaves. Some
times, the symptom becomes very acute and
the spear fails to unfurl.
This disease is a fungal complex initiated
predominantly by Colletotrichum gloeospo-
rioides, Exserohilum rostratum and Fusarium
spp.
Management
1.
Remove the rotten portions from the spear
and the two adjacent leaves.
2.
Pour 300 ml of fungicidal solution at the
base of the spear. This can be prepared
by mixing hexaconazole 5 EC 2 ml or
mancozeb 3 g in 300 ml water.
3.
Treat the top two leaf axils with insecticide
preparation. This can be prepared by
mixing cartap hydrochloride 20 g with
200 g sand.
4.
Spray crowns and leaves with 1per cent
Bordeaux mixture or copper oxy chloride
formulations (2 g l-1) or mancozeb (3 g l-
1) in January, April-May and September.
While spraying, care has to be taken to
spray the spindle leaf.
5.
After crown cleaning (removal and
destruction of affected parts) in coconut
palms pour 300 ml of any of the following
bio-control agent at the base of spear
leaves twice a year (April-May and
September-October) 1. Pseudomonas
fluorescens (20 g  l-1) or 2. PGPR mix II
(20 g  l-1).
Stem bleeding
Symptoms
Exudation of the reddish brown liquid
through the growth cracks mostly at the basal
part of the trunk and bleeding patches higher
up in the trunk are characteristic symptoms.
One or more lesions, lying close by, may
coalesce to form large patches. The liquid that
oozes out dries up and turns black. The tissues
beneath the bleeding points decay and become
yellowish. The lesions spread upwards as the
disease progresses. In advanced stages, the
leaf size reduces leading to reduction in crown
size. The rate of leaf production slows down.
The production of bunches is affected and nut
shedding takes place. The trunk gradually
tapers towards the apex. The progress of the
disease is faster during July to November.
Causal organism
The fungus, Thielaviopsis paradoxa is the
causal agent. Growth cracks on the trunk,
severe summer followed by heavy down pour,
water stagnation, imbalance in nutrition, excess
salinity and stress can act as predisposing /
aggravating factors.
Management
1. Chisel out completely the affected tissues
and paint the wound with Bordeaux paste.
Apply coal tar after 1-2 days.
2. Destroy the chiseled materials by burning.
Avoid any mechanical injury to trunk.
3. Apply neem cake @ 5 kg per palm in the
basin along with other organics.
4. Apply hexaconazole @ 25 ml in 25 litre of
water as soil drenching once in four months.
5. Swabbing the lesions on the trunk with a
paste of Trichoderma viride talc based
COCONUT
110
formulation (100 g 100 ml-1) along with
application of lime or dolomite @ 1kg palm-1
during April-May and application of neem
cake (5kg palm-1) + organic manure
enriched with Trichoderma viride (1%)
during September-October.
Grey blight
This is caused by the fungus Pestalotia
palmarum.
Symptoms
Symptoms appear in the mature leaves of
the outer whorl as yellow specks encircled by
a greyish band which later become greyish
white. The spots coalesce into irregular
necrotic patches causing extensive leaf blight.
In advanced stages, the tips and margins of
the leaflets dry and shrivel giving a burnt
appearance.
Management
Remove severely affected older leaves and
burn. Spray the trees with 1 per cent Bordeaux
mixture or propiconazole @ 1 ml l-1.
Tanjore wilt
Symptoms
This disease is of recent occurrence in
many parts of Kerala, especially in the districts
of Palakkad, Malappuram, Thrissur, Kollam,
Thiruvananthapuram and Wayanad. Middle
aged palms were seen fatally affected. The
characteristic symptom of the disease is the
rotting of the basal portion of the stem. The
bark turns brittle and often gets peeled off in
flakes, leaving open cracks and crevices. The
internal tissues are discoloured and
disintegrated, emitting a bad smell. Mild
bleeding occurs on the basal region. The tissues
on the bleeding spots are soft to touch.
Extensive damage of the root system following
root rotting has been observed. Ultimately the
palm dies off.
Management
1. Apply organic manure @ 50 kg palm-1.
2. Apply neem cake @ 5 kg  palm-1 year-1.
3. Reduce fertilizer application to one-fourth
of the recommended dose.
4. Drench the basin with 40 litres of any
copper fungicide to soak soil up to 15 cm
depth at quarterly intervals.
5. Avoid flood irrigation in order to prevent
the possible spread of the pathogen through
soil.
6. Isolate the affected palm from the healthy
ones by digging a trench of size 1 m deep
and 50 cm wide, 1.5 m away from the bole
of the infected palm.
7. Avoid growing leguminous crops in and
around the garden.
Safe storage of copra
Copra obtained from commonly cultivated
varieties / cultivars is attacked by various insect
pests in store. Among these ham beetle,
Necrobia rufipes and saw toothed grain
beetle, Oryzaphilus surinamensis are of
major importance, which can cause more than
15 per cent loss to copra when stored for more
than six months.
Following precautions are to be taken for
the safe storage of copra for more than three
months:
1.
Dry the produce to 4 per cent  moisture
content.
2.
Avoid heap storage, which causes
maximum damage.
3.
Store copra in netted polythene bags or
gunny bags.

of the dryer is 2.25 m length, 1.5 m breadth
and 1.5 m height. The capacity of the dryer is
1000-1200 nuts per batch.  The dryer has two
heating chambers which are arranged in
parallel.  Specially developed rolling in type of
fuel trays are used for burning the fuel. The
dryer consists of a drying chamber, a burning
chamber, a plenum chamber and ventilation
holes. Each full tray produces heat for 6 hours,
with a temperature of about 80-82oC.
Generally after 6 hours, when the temperature
drops below 60oC, the fuel trays are removed
from the dryer, cleaned and reloaded with fuel,
refired and replaced into respective burning
chambers.  About 4 loads of fuel are required
with a capacity of 80 shells per tray to dry the
copra to about 6.25 per cent moisture content.
The total drying time is 24 hours. The cost of
the dryer is approx Rs.35,000/-. Farmers and
entrepreneurs interested to purchase this dryer

ing of the crop and mix with the soil by light
hoeing or raking.
Irrigation and interculture
Irrigate the crop once in 7 days.  Weed the
crop 10-15 days after germination of seed by
light hoeing.  Give another light hoeing or

raking at the time of application of lime.  Do
not disturb the soil after 45 days of sowing.
Plant protection
Red hairy caterpillar, termites and leaf min-
ers are the major pests of groundnut.  Against
leaf miner apply any of the organophosphorus
insecticides with contact action.
Tikka leaf spot disease infects both the
rainfed and irrigated crops. Prophylactic spray-
ing with Bordeaux mixture 1.0 per cent before
flowering will control the disease.
Harvesting
The crop will be ready for harvest when
the leaves start yellowing and begin to dry up.
Development of brown colour inside the pods
also indicates maturity of the crop.
OIL PALM (Elaeis guineensis)
Oil palm grows best in areas with a mean
maximum temperature of 30-32oC and on an
average of at least five hours of sunlight.
It can be grown in areas, which receive
well-distributed annual rainfall of 200 cm or
more.  However, it can tolerate two to four
months of dry spell.  The oil palm grows on
wide range of tropical soils.  The adult palms
can withstand occasional waterlogging, but
frequently waterlogged, extremely sandy and
hard lateritic soils should be avoided.
Varieties
The only variety recommended for
commercial cultivation is Tenera, which is a
hybrid between Dura and Pisifera.
Nursery practices
The fruits are separated from the bunch
and seeds are extracted by scraping off the
exocarp and mesocarp with a knife, or by
retting in water. The seeds are then dried by
spreading them on concrete or wooden floors
under shade for two days.  Such seeds can be
stored for 3-9 months at about 27oC
without much reduction in viability.
Seeds are soaked in water for five days,
changing the water daily.  Thereafter, the seeds
are spread out to dry for 24 hours.  The dried
seeds are put in polythene bags and placed in
germinator maintained at a temperature of
40ºC.  After 80 days, the seeds are removed
from polythene bags, soaked in water for
5 days changing the water daily and dried in
the shade for two hours.  The seeds are then
put back into bags and kept in a cool place in
order to maintain the moisture content.
Germination commences in about 10-12 days.
The percentage of germination obtainable by this
method is 90-95.
Raising nursery
Polybags (preferably black) of 400-500
gauge measuring 40 cm x 35 cm are used.  The
bags are filled with topsoil and compost and
are arranged at a spacing of 45 cm x 45 cm and
one sprouted seed is dibbled per bag.  A good
mulching during summer is desirable.
Watering the seedlings weekly thrice is
recommended.  A fertilizer mixture containing
15 g N, 15 g P2O5 and 6 g K2O at the
rate of 8 g in five litres of water for 100
seedlings may be applied when the seedlings
are two months and eight months old.
Planting
Oil palm is planted in the main field in
triangular system at spacing of 9 m
accommodating 140 palms per ha.  Planting is
preferably done at the onset of monsoon
113
GROUNDNUT AND OIL PALM
during May-June.  The polythene bag is torn
open and the entire ball of earth is buried in
the pit (50 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm) and levelled.
Manuring
The following fertilizer schedule is
considered satisfactory for oil palm.
N:P2O5:K2O
g/palm/year
First year
400:200:400
Second year
800:400:800
Third year onwards
1200:600:1200
Mg application is necessary only if
deficiency symptoms are noticed. Fertilizers
are preferably applied in two equal split doses
(May and September), within 2 m  diameter
around the palm and forked in.  Supply of
 sufficient quantities of green leaf or compost
is advantageous, especially where the soil is
poor in organic matter.
Leaf pruning
Dead and diseased leaves and all
inflorescences should be cut off regularly
upto three years after planting.  When the
palms are yielding, judicious pruning to retain
about 40 leaves on the crown is advocated.  It
is necessary to remove some of the leaves
while harvesting.  In such cases, care should
be taken to avoid over pruning.  In addition, all
dead and excess leaves should be cut off and
crown cleaned at least once in a year,
usually during the dry season.
Pollination
Oil palm is a cross-pollinated crop.
Assisted pollination is done to ensure
fertilization of all female flowers.  However,
this is not necessary if the pollination weevil
Elaedobius kamerunicus is introduced in the
plantation.  They congregate and multiply on
male inflorescence during flower opening.  The
weevils also visit the female flowers and
pollinate them effectively.
Harvesting
First harvest can be taken 3.5 to 4 years
after planting.  When a few ripe fruits are loose/
fall off, the bunch is ready for harvesting.
Processing over-ripe fruits reduces quantity
and quality of oil.
A chisel is used for harvesting bunches from
young palms.  The stalk of the bunch is struck
hard with the chisel to cut off and push the
bunch out.  When the palms become taller
(from 10 year onwards) a harvesting hook has
to be used.  When the palms are too tall, it is
necessary to climb the palms for harvesting.
Plant protection
Pests
Rhinoceros beetle
The pest causes severe damage to
emerging fronds and spindle.  The adult beetle
feeds on the softer tissue of the rachis,
resulting in snapping off of the fronds and
spears at the feeding sites.  Field sanitation
and elimination of breeding sites are
essential components of the pest management
operation. This pest can be suppressed by
using the virus Baculovirus oryctes.
Red palm weevil
This is a major pest of oil palm in India.
These weevils lay their eggs at the cut end of
petioles or other wounds. The emerging
larvae tunnel into the crown and feed on the
growing tissues.  Palms infested by red palm
OIL PALM
114
weevil start wilting and leaves show
gradually increasing chlorosis and fracture in
strong winds.
Birds
Many birds such as the forest crow, the
house crow and the common Indian myna
cause severe damage to oil palm fruit bunches.
These birds feed on the mesocarp of the oil
palm fruits.  The damage can be minimized by
scaring the birds and covering the ripe bunch
with wire net, 150 days after fruit set.
Diseases
Anthracnose
This disease occurs in the nursery.  It is
recognized by regular or irregular brown to
black leaf blotches surrounded by yellow
haloes, which develop along the margin,
centre or tip of the leaves.  It causes heavy
seedling loss.  The disease can be controlled
by spraying mancozeb or captan @ 200 g 100-1
litres of water.  Copper fungicides should not
be used because of the extreme susceptibility
of oil palm seedlings to copper burn
(scorching).
Spear rot
This is noticed to affect oil palms of all ages.
The incidence is less than one per cent.
Yellowing starts from tip of the innermost whorl
of leaves. Small lesions occur at the  distal
portions of spear and rotting extends
downwards.  As the disease advances, new
leaves become rudimentary and show rotting.
General decline in vigour and production is then
noticed. Occurrence of spear rot without
yellowing has also been noticed.  Distinguish-
able marginal yellowing of leaflets and sudden
drying of leaves showing yellowing are other
symptoms. Roguing of all the affected palms
may be adopted to prevent further spread of
the disease. In early stages of the disease, the
affected portions of leaves may be removed
and burnt.
Bunch failure
Sparse or no fruit set followed by complete
drying or rotting of the affected bunches are
the typical symptoms. The extent of incidence
can be up to 20 per cent.  This malady is
generally attributed to excess pruning, mutual
shading, underpollination, moisture stress and
unhygienic conditions.  The situation can be
improved by assisted pollination as well as by
adopting hygienic measures like removal of
infected bunches and dry male inflorescence.
Processing
For mature plantations not exceeding
40 ha, a hand-operated hydraulic press will be
enough for extraction of oil. In the case of
large-scale plantations, the hydraulic press will
not be economical and as such, mechanically
driven oil mills have to be established.  The
fruit bunches brought to the factory are first
quartered by means of a chisel. They are then
sterilized in steam or boiling water for 30-60
minutes. The objective of this process is to
inactivate the fat splitting enzymes, which are
present in the fruit, which may raise the free
fatty acid content of the oil and also to soften
the fruits for easy pounding. The sterilized fruits
are stripped off from the bunch and then
pounded. The pounded fruit mass is then
reheated and squeezed using a hydraulic press.
It is then boiled in a clarification drum where
the sludge will deposit and pure oil float over
the water.  The oil is then drained out.

OIL PALM
Preparation of land and sowing
Prepare the soil into a fine tilth by ploughing
2-4 times and breaking the clods.  Seed rate is
4-5 kg ha-1.  Broadcast seeds evenly, prefer-
ably mixed with sand 2-3 times its
volume, to ensure uniform coverage. Work with
harrow, followed by pressing with wooden plank
so as to cover the seed in the soil.
Manuring
Apply manures and fertilizers at the
following rates.
Cattle manure / compost: 5 t ha-1
N:P2O5:K2O: 30:15:30 kg ha-1
Apply cattle manure/compost as basal
dressing and incorporate into the soil along with
last ploughing.  Apply fertilizers as basal dose
when there is enough moisture in the soil. Urea
is preferable to ammonium sulphate. Nitrogen
may be applied in split doses, 75 per cent as
basal and the balance as foliar spray at 3 per
cent concentration, 20-35 days after sowing
keeping the discharge rate at 500 1 ha-1.
Interculture
After cultivation of the crop may be done
twice, first at 15 days and the next 25-35 days
after sowing.  When the plants are about
15 cm in height, thin the crop so as to give a
spacing of 15-25 cm between plants.
SESAME (Sesamum indicum)
Sesame grows in well-drained, sandy loam
soils. Coarse sandy soils and soils of alkaline
and saline nature are not suited for the crop.
Season
Lowland paddy field: December–April
(third crop)
Uplands: August–December
Varieties
For upland cultivation use varieties
with long duration of 100-110 days and for low
land, use varieties with duration of
80-99 days (Table 27).

Irrigation
Usually the crop is grown under rainfed
conditions.  When facilities are available, the
crop may be irrigated to field capacity after
thinning operation and thereafter at 15-20 days
interval.  Stop irrigation just before the pods
begin to mature.
Surface irrigation at 3 cm depth during the
critical stages, viz., 4-5 leaves, branching,
flowering and pod formation will increase the
yield by 35-52 per cent.  Two irrigations of
3 cm depth each in the vegetative phase (4-5
leaf stage or branching) and in reproductive
phase (at flowering or pod formation) are the
best, registering maximum yield and water use
efficiency.  In the case of single irrigation, it
can be best given in the reproductive phase.
In the tail end fields in command area, best
use of the sparingly available water can be
made for augmenting sesame production.
Plant protection
Azadirachtin 0.03 per cent at 5 ml per litre
spray at 7th and 20th DAS and thereafter need
based application can manage the incidence
of leaf and pod caterpillar, pod borer
infestation and phyllody incidence.
For control of leaf curl disease, remove and
destroy disease affected sesame plants as well
as the diseased collateral hosts like chilli,
tomato and zinnia.
Remove plants affected with phyllody and
destroy them. Do not use seeds from affected
plants for sowing.
Harvesting
Harvest the crop, when the capsules turn
yellowish by pulling out the plants. Harvest
during the morning hours. Cut the root
portion and stack the plants in bundles for
3-4 days when the leaves will fall off.  Spread
in the sun and beat with sticks to break
open the capsules. Repeat this for 3 days.
Preserve seeds collected during the first day
for seed purposes. Clean and dry in sun for
about 7 days before storing.
Storage of seeds
By keeping sesame seeds in polybags, tin
bins, wooden receptacles or in earthen pots,
the viability can be maintained for about one
year. Admixture of seeds with ash will
drastically reduce germination.

SPICES AND CONDIMENTS
CARDAMOM (Elettaria cardamomum)
The habitat of small cardamom is the
evergreen forests of Western Ghats. It is grown
in areas where the annual rainfall ranges from
1500-4000 mm with a temperature range of
10-35 ºC and an altitude of 600-1200 m above
MSL.
Cardamom is generally grown in forest
loam soils rich in available phosphorus and
potassium. The crop is raised mainly on well
drained, deep, good textured soils rich in
humus.
Varieties
ICRI-1, ICRI-2, PV-1 and PV-2. ISSR
Vijetha is resistant to Katte disease and is
recommended to moderate rainfall with
moderate to high shaded  mosaic (cardamom
mosaic virus) infected areas. IISR Avinash is
resistant to rhizome rot and is highly
suitable for planting in valleys.
Cultivars
Malabar :
Suitable for areas from 600
to 1200 m elevation
Mysore
:
Suitable for areas from 900
to 1200 m elevation
Vazhukka :
Suitable for areas from 900
to 1400 m elevation
Propagation
Cardamom can be propagated vegetatively
and by seedlings. However, in Kerala where
viral diseases is a serious problem seed
propagation is not popular among farmers.
Vegetative propagation
In Kerala, vegetative propagation is
commonly practiced. For vegetative
propagation, rhizomes with an old shoot and a
sprout are used. Plants propagated vegetatively
come to bearing one year earlier than the
seedling propagated plants and are true to type.
Rhizome multiplication
This may be taken up from the first week
of March to the first fortnight of October. The
site is selected in open, gently slopping and
well-drained areas near a source of
water. Trenches of 45 cm width, 45 cm depth
and convenient length are taken across the
slope or along the contour 1.8 m apart. They
are filled with equal quantity of humus rich
topsoil, sand and cattle manure. Uproot a part
of the high yielding disease free mother clump
identified in the plantation. Trim the roots and
separate the suckers so that the minimum
planting unit consists of one grown up tiller and
a growing young shoot. Plant them at a spacing
of 1.80 m x 0.60 m in filled up trenches. Provide
sufficient mulch and stake each planting unit.
Provide overhead pandal as in the case of
seedling nursery and remove shading material
with onset of monsoon rains. Provide irrigation
once in a fortnight and adopt necessary plant
protection measures. Apply fertilizers
@ 100:50:200 kg ha-1 N:P2O5:K2O in six splits
at an interval of two months. Apply neem cake
@ 100-150 g/plant along with fertilizers. On
an average, 20 to 30 suckers / initial planting
unit can be produced within one year of
planting. Care should be taken to identify and
collect mother clumps only from areas totally
free from ‘katte’ disease.
Main field planting
Cardamom plantation is raised in forests
under the shade of tall trees. For raising a
new cardamom plantation, the undergrowth of
CARDAMOM
118
bushes is cleared. When open areas like marshy
valleys and grasslands are selected for raising
new plantation, saplings of  shade trees have
to be raised before planting cardamom sucker.
The quick growing shade trees like Vernonia
arborea and  Toona ciliata are generally used
for this purpose. Other quick growing trees like
Albizia can also be used. Useful trees like jack
can be used along with wild nutmeg,
kurangatti etc.
Spacing
Mysore and Vazhukka: 2 m x 2 m to
3 m x 2 m depending on the fertility of the soil.
Malabar: 1.5 m x 1.5 m to 2 m x 2 m
depending on the fertility of the soil.
The recommended size of pits is 60 cm x
60 cm x 35 cm. The pits are filled with rich
topsoil at least two months in advance of
planting the seedlings. Application of well
decomposed FYM or compost or leaf mould
and 100 g of rock phosphate with the topsoil in
the pit will help in proper establishment and
quick growth of plants. If the selected site is a
hill slope, terraces may be formed before
digging pits.
Planting can be done with the commence-
ment of southwest monsoon, before the heavy
rains. A small pit may be formed inside the pit
by scooping out soil at the centre of the pit for
planting single tillers. The soil may be put just
to cover the rhizomes. Care should be taken
to ensure that the rhizomes do not go deep into
the soil.
Cultural operations
A regular schedule of cultural practices
consisting of weeding, mulching, trashing,
shade regulation, fertilizer application,
irrigation, etc. will have to be undertaken.
Sufficient mulch should be applied at the
base of the plant during December to reduce
the ill effects of drought during summer months
and to conserve soil moisture. Sickle weeding
is essential which has to be carried out
frequently depending upon the intensity of
weeds. Forking is necessary in hard soils,
which is to be carried out in October-
November.
Trashing (removal of old and dried shoots,
leaves and dried panicles) should be taken up
once in a year during June-July, with the
commencement of monsoon. This will help to
prevent the spread of diseases and expose the
panicles to easy visit by honeybees.
Soil conservation measures, maintenance
of drainage channels and such other
operations may be taken up promptly.
Manuring
Application of organic manures such as
FYM, cowdung or compost @ 5 kg / plant or
neem cake @ 1-2 kg / plant may be done during
June-July. The present recommendation of
nutrients for cardamom in Kerala under rainfed
situation is N:P2O5:K2O @ 75:75:150 kg ha-1.
The fertilizers may be applied in two split doses,
before and after the southwest monsoon, in a
circular band of 20 cm wide and 30-40 cm
away from the base of the clumps and mixed
with soil.
Shade
Since inadequate as well as excessive
levels of shade are harmful to the crop,
regulation of shade is inevitable. There should
be sufficient shade to protect cardamom plant
during the hot season. By regulating the
shade before the monsoon, more light
becomes available to the plant during the rainy
season. Red cedar or chandana-vempu (Toona
ciliata) is an ideal shade tree. It sheds the
leaves during rainy season and thus
provides natural shade regulation. Some of the
other ideal shade trees are kurangatti
119
CARDAMOM
capsules are spread thinly in the wire net trays
and stirred frequently to ensure uniform drying.
They are initially heated at 50oC for the first
4 hours and heat is then reduced to 45oC by
opening ventilators and operating exhaust fans
till the capsules are properly dried. Finally the
temperature is raised to 60oC for an hour.
The dried capsules are rubbed on wire
mesh to remove the stalk and dried portion of
flower from the capsules and then graded
according to size by passing through sieves of
sizes of 7, 6.5, 6 mm etc. The graded
produce is stored in polythene lined gunny bags
to retain the green colour during storage and
also to avoid exposure to moisture.
A relatively new innovation in the curing
procedure is blanching by soaking the fruits in
2.0 per cent washing soda for 10 minutes prior
to drying. This inhibits colour loss during drying
operation and extends colour retention during
subsequent storage from three months to ten
months.
Sun drying
Capsules are dried directly under sunlight
for five to six days or more. Frequent
turning is done. This method can result in
surface blemishes and may not give
an attractive green colour. This method is
practiced if the cultivar yields fruits that turn
yellow before they are ready for picking and
where facilities for green curing are not
available.
Bleaching
A proportion of the crop is bleached after
sun drying by exposing the capsules to fumes
from burning sulphur to get uniform colour and
appearance. Steeping capsules in a
dilute solution of potassium metabisulphite
solution induces a slight improvement in
keeping quality.
(Acrocarpus 
fraxinifolius), 
vellakil
(Dysoxylum malabaricum) and thelli
(Canarium strictum).
Bee-keeping for better pollination
The main pollination agent in cardamom is
honeybee (Apis cerana indica). Maintaining
four bee colonies per hectare during
the flowering season is recommended for
increasing fruit set and production of
capsules.
Harvesting and processing
Cardamom plants normally start bearing
capsules from the second year of planting.
Picking is carried out at an interval of
45 days. After harvest, cardamom capsules are
processed.
Cardamom capsules with green colour
fetch a premium price in foreign countries.
Hence emphasis has to be given on the
preservation of green colour during curing and
subsequent storage. Capsule should be
processed within 24-36 hours after harvest to
prevent colour deterioration. By curing, the
moisture of green cardamom is reduced to 11
per cent at an optimum temperature so as to
retain its green colour to the maximum extent.
Harvesting is done almost round the
year in Kerala with the peak period from
August - October.
Artificial drying
Processing of capsules is done in specially
built curing houses. The harvested capsules are
washed in water to remove dust and soil
particles. Then they are spread on wire net
trays in curing chamber. Burning firewood in
the iron kiln produces heat required for
drying. The heat thus produced is passed
through pipes made of galvanized iron sheets.
The process of drying takes about 18-24 hours,
depending on the ambient temperature. The

Oleoresin
Solvent extraction of ground spice yields
10 per cent oleoresin.  Cardamom oleoresin
dispersed in salt, flour etc., is used for flavouring
food. One kilogram of oleoresin replaces
20 kg ground spice.
Decorticated seeds / seed powder
Decorticated seeds command a lower price
due to rapid loss of volatile oil during storage
and transportation. Seed powder is marketed
to a limited extent.
Control of pests and diseases in the
plantation
Cardamom thrips (Sciothrips cardamomi)
This insect is a serious pest of cardamom.
It colonizes and breeds in unopened leaves, leaf
sheath, flower bracts and flower tubes. It
lacerates and feeds on the exuding sap from
the aerial parts. Infestation on the panicle and
flower buds results in stunted growth of
panicles, shedding of flower buds and warty
growth on the surviving capsules. The infested
capsules are light in weight, inferior in quality
and fetch very low price in the market. Since
the pest population is high during dry months
from December to May, pesticide application
during this period is important. Four sprayings
of insecticide during this period is
recommended. Insecticide application can be
skipped during rainy months of June and July.
Three more sprayings are to be given during
the period from August-November. Any of the
following insecticides are recommended for
thrips control.
 Quinalphos 0.05 per cent, phosalone 0.07
per cent,  dimethoate 0.05 per cent.
Shoot/capsule borer
(Conogethes punctiferalis)
It is a serious problem to cardamom
growers of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.
At the early stage of the crop, the caterpillars
of this yellow coloured moth bore into the core
of the aerial stem resulting in the death of
central spindle, which appears as characteristic
dead hearts.
At the time of flowering, when the
caterpillars attack the panicles and spikes it
may lead to flower shedding and drying up of
the attacked portions. At a later stage of the
crop, the caterpillars bore into the capsules,
feed on the seeds and make them hollow. The
presence of excreta at the region of attack
indicates presence of the caterpillars in the
pseudostem, inflorescence and pods.
Pest infestation is pronounced in three
seasons viz. January-February, June and
September-October.
Management
Later stages of larvae bore into the
pseudostem and remain there. Insecticides
sprayed at this time may not give adequate
control of the pest. For an effective
management of the pest, the insecticides
have to be targeted on early stages of  the
larvae, which are usually present within 15-20
days after adult emergence in the field.
Chemicals like Quinalphos and dimethoate
@ 0.05% are recommended.
Leaf eating caterpillars
There are 10 species of caterpillars
feeding on cardamom leaves. Out of these,
seven species are hairy and appear in large
numbers during certain seasons causing
extensive defoliation. For controlling the leaf
caterpillars, mechanical collection and
destruction and spraying of any contact
insecticide are recommended.

CARDAMOM
Cardamom whitefly [Kanakarajiella
(Dialeurodes) cardamomi]
It is a serious pest in cardamom growing
tracts of Kerala. The adult is a small
soft bodied insect, about 2 mm long and
having two pairs of white wings. The nymphs
are elliptical and pale green. The nymphs
secrete sticky honeydew, which drops on to
lower leaves. On these, black sooty mould
develops, which interrupts photosynthesis of
the leaves.
Management
The flies are attracted towards yellow
colour. So metal sheets painted yellow and
coated with sticky materials, such as castor oil
or poly-venyl butanol would serve as traps. By
placing such yellow sticky traps between rows
of cardamom plants, population of adults can
be monitored and adults trapped to some
extent. Nymphs are effectively controlled by
spraying the lower surface of leaves with a
mixture of neem oil (500 ml) and triton (500
ml) in 100 litres of water. Acephate 0.1 per
cent is effective. The spray may be repeated
two or three times at 15 days interval.
Cardamom root grubs (Basilepta
fulvicorne)
The grubs of a small, greenish blue beetle
cause damage. The grubs are short, stout, pale
white in colour and often assume a shape
resembling ‘C’, which feeds on cardamom
roots. The symptoms start as yellowing of
leaves, which later result in the drying up and
death of the plant.
Management
Collect the beetle with hand nets or sticky
traps at the time of mass emergence (March-
April and August-September) and destroy.
Early stages of the grub which are usually
present in soil during May-June and
September-October can be controlled by
drenching chlorpyriphos 0.04 per cent @
3-4 litre per clump 10-15 cm around the plant.
Cardamom scale (Aulacaspis sp.)
This scale insect is found on the lower
surface of leaves, leaf sheath, panicles and fruit
stalk. As a result of damage, capsules get
shrivelled, panicles become dry and the leaves
become yellow. The pest is mostly seen during
summer months.
Nematodes (Meloidogyne sp.)
Root knot nematodes are the most
common nematode species associated with
cardamom plantations. Common symptoms are
necrosis of leaf tips and margins,
narrowing of leaves, thickening of veins,
reduction of internodal length and
rosetting. Roots branch heavily and galls
appear on them. Plant becomes highly stunted.
Management
Frequent change of nursery beds will help
to reduce nematode infestation in nurseries.
Application of cartap hydrochloride 4G @
1 kg ai/ha before monsoon and use of Neem
cake 2 kg/plant before monsoon or Bacillus
macerans (1 X 107  cfu) 30 g/plant or
Psuedomonas fluorescens (1 X 108  cfu)
30 g/plant before monsoon.
Diseases
Katte or mosaic
This is a virus disease, which is transmitted
by the banana aphid, Pentalonia nigro-
nervosa. The symptoms consist of
discontinuous stripes of light green colour
running almost parallel to each other from the
mid-rib to the margin of the leaves, which form
a mosaic pattern. On young shoots, such stripes
are seen on the leaf sheath also. The infected
clumps will be smaller in size with fewer tillers.
CARDAMOM
122
Management
Eradication of the source of inoculum by
destroying infected plants and destruction of
the vector by insecticide application are
effective. Regular application of insecticide
against cardamom thrips controls the aphids
also. Avoid using katte-infected rhizome for
planting.
Destruction of plants showing symptoms of
the disease should be done promptly once in
two months. Removal of all alternate hosts of
virus is also recommended.
Azhukal
This is a fungal disease caused by
Phytophthora sp. occurring during the rainy
season. It affects the leaves, tender shoots,
panicles and capsules. On the infected leaves,
water soaked lesions appear first and rotting
and shedding of leaves along the veins
occur thereafter. The infected capsules
become dull greenish brown and decay.
This emits a foul smell and subsequently shed.
Infection spreads to the panicles also.
Management
Trashing and destruction of the infected
parts should be done as a phytosanitary
measure just prior to the onset of southwest
monsoon. Remove the trash (dried leaves and
leaf sheaths) from the basal region of the plant
to the extent possible.
Spray the shoots with 1 per cent Bordeaux
mixture with adhesive (rosin soda or any other
sticker) by the commencement of the
monsoon and continue the spraying
operation two or three times up to November-
December according to the intensity of the
disease and rainfall. Give spray to the panicle
with 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture during
July-August when the disease intensity is
maximum.
Drench with 0.1% Fosetyl –Al (3-5 l /plant)
and repeat this at monthly interval depending
the intensity of the disease and rainfall.
 Prophylactic application of the biocontrol
agent Pseudomonas fluorescens (two percent
spray) along with basal application of
Mycorrhiza (100 g) and Trichoderma viride
(50 g) per plant by the commencement of the
monsoon and continue the spraying
operation monthly depending on the intensity
of the disease and rainfall. Trichoderma can
be used along with cowdung for controlling this
disease.
Clump rot or rhizome rot
This disease is caused by Pythium
aphanidermatum, P. vexans, Rhizoctonia
solani and Fusarium oxysporum. The
affected shoots become brittle and easily break
off from the rhizome at the bulbous base.
Management
Drench with 2 g l-1 copper oxychloride
(2-3 l plant-1) and repeat this two times at
monthly intervals.
As a bio-control measure, inoculate
suckers with native arbuscular mycorrhiza,
Trichoderma and Pseudomonas fluorescens
at the time of planting and apply during
pre-monsoon period in established plantations
(see the chapter on biocontrol agents against
plant pathogens).
Stem rot or stem lodging
This disease is caused by a fungus
(Fusarium oysporum). The pathogen attach
middle portion of a tillers as a result, the
infected one produces pale colour lesions
leading to dry rotting. The disease occurs
during non rainy seasons.
Management
The affected tillers must be removed and

CARDAMOM
CINNAMON  (Cinnamomum  zeylanicum)
Cinnamon grows in areas up to an
altitude of about 1800 m. Humid tropical
evergreen rain forest conditions favour the best
growth of cinnamon. Well-drained, deep sandy
soil, rich in humus is suitable for the crop. Avoid
marshy areas and hard laterites.
Varieties
Navasree, Nithyasree and Sugandini.
Seeds and sowing
Cinnamon is usually propagated through
seeds. Sow seeds immediately after harvest
on raised beds. Pot seedlings when they are
six months old.
destroyed. Spraying Carbendazim @ 0.1per
cent checks the disease spread. Application
of Trichoderma @ 10 g per clump-1 along
with 0.5 kg quality neem cake is
recommended as preventive measure.
Leaf blotch disease
The fungus Phaeodactylium venkate-
sanum causes this disease. The disease is
characterized by the appearance of large
blotches of irregular lesions with alternating
shades of light and dark brown necrotic
tissues. This is mainly observed on mature
leaves. On the lower surface of the lesions
ash coloured white superficial growth of
the fungus appears during moist weather
conditions.
Management
The fungicides, Bordeaux mixture (1 per
cent), mancozeb (3 g l-1) and carbendazim
(1 g l-1) are effective in controlling the disease.
Chenthal disease
Chenthal disease is characterized by the
appearance of rectangular linear reddish brown
lesions mainly on the lower surface of the
leaves. The lesions are clearly visible even on
dried leaves. The incidence of the disease
appears to be more severe in areas, which do
not have proper shade. Even though
Corynebacterium and Colletotrichum
gloeosporioides have been isolated from the
infected leaves, the pathogenicity of these
organisms could not be established.
Management
Providing adequate shade is the only
measure recommended pending confirmation
of etiology of the disease.
Waiting period of insecticide / fungicide

Vegetative propagation
For raising cinnamon from cuttings; semi
hardwood cuttings of about 10 cm length with
2 leaves are taken and dipped in IBA 2000
ppm  and planted either in polythene bags filled
with sand or a mixture of sand and coirdust in
the ratio 1:1 or in sand beds raised in a shaded
place. The cuttings in polythene bags must
also be kept in a shaded place or in a nursery.
The cuttings are to be watered regularly 2-3
times a day for maintaining adequate moisture
and prevent wilting. Rooting takes place in 45-
60 days. The well rooted cuttings can be
transplanted to polythene bags filled with
potting mixture and maintained in a shaded
place and watered regularly.
CARDAMOM AND CINNAMON
124
Air Layering
Air layering is recommended for all
cinnamon nurseries. It is done on semi
hardwood shoots. A ring of bark is removed
from the semi hardwood portion of the shoot
and a rooting hormone (IBA 2000 ppm or IAA
2000 ppm) is applied on the portion where the
bark has been removed. Moist coir dust or coir
husk is placed around the region where the
hormone has been applied and is secured in
position by wrapping with a polythene sheet
of 20 cm length. This would also avoid
moisture loss. Rooting takes place in 40-60
days. The well rooted air layers are separated
from the mother plant and bagged in polythene
bags filled with potting mixture and kept in a
shaded place or nursery by watering the plants
twice daily.
Planting
Select seedlings with green leaf petioles.
Plant seedlings in the main field when they are
1-2 years old with the commencement of
southwest monsoon. Planting is done in pits of
size 60 cm x 60 cm at a spacing of
2 m x 2 m. Dig the pits sufficiently early to
allow weathering. Fill the pit with leaf mould
and topsoil before planting.
Manuring
Apply N:P2O5:K2O @ 20:20:25 g per
seedling in the first year and double this dose
in the second year. Cattle manure or compost
at 20 kg per plant per annum may also be
applied. Increase the dose of N:P2O5:K2O
gradually to 200:180:200 g per tree per year
for grown up plants of 10 years and above.
Apply organic manures in May-June and
fertilizers in two equal split doses, in
May-June and September-October.
After cultivation
Weed regularly in the early stages of
growth. Irrigate the seedlings till they get
established, if there is long drought period.
Prune plants when they are 2-3 years old at a
height of 15 cm above ground level. Cut the
side shoots growing from the base to
encourage growth of more side shoots till the
whole plant assumes the shape of a low bush.
Harvesting and curing
The plants will be ready for harvest in about
3 years after planting. Harvesting is done
during two seasons, the first in May and
second in November. The correct time for
cutting the shoots for peeling is determined by
noting the sap circulation between the wood and
corky layer. Peelers can judge this by making a
test cut on the stem with a sharp knife. If the
bark separates readily, the cutting is taken
immediately. Stems measuring 2.0 to 2.5 cm in
diameter and 1.5 to 2.0 m length are cut early in
the morning and twigs and leaves are detached.
The outer brown skin is first scrapped off and
the stem is rubbed briskly to loosen the bark.
Two cuts are made round the stem about
30 cm apart and two longitudinal slits are made
on opposite sides of the stem. The bark is
separated from the wood with curved knife. The
detached pieces of bark are made into
compound quills. The best and longest quills are
used on the outside while inside is filled with
smaller pieces. The compound quills are rolled
by hand to press the outside edges together and
are neatly trimmed. They are dried in shade as
direct exposure to sun can result in warping.
The dried quills consist of mixture of coarse and
fine types and are yellowish brown in colour.
The quills are graded as Fine or Continental,
Mexican and Hamburg or Ordinary. The Fine
consists of quills of uniform thickness, colour
and quality and the joints of the quills are neat.
Mexican grades are intermediate in quality. The
Hamburg grade consists of thicker and darker
quills. The lower grades are exported as:
(a) Quillings: The broken lengths and

CINNAMON
CLOVE (Syzygium aromaticum)
Clove requires a warm humid tropical
climate with an annual rainfall from
150-250 cm. It grows well from mean sea level
up to an altitude of 800-900 m. Deep loam soils
with high humus content and black loams of
semi-forest regions with good drainage are
fragments of quills of all grades are bulked and
sold as quillings; (b) Featherings: This grade
consists of the inner bark of twigs and twisted
shoots that do not give straight quills of normal
length.
Chips: This includes the trimmings of the cut
shoots, shavings of outer and inner bark, which
cannot be separated, or which are obtained
from small twigs and odd pieces of thick outer
bark.
Oleoresin
Cinnamon oleoresin is prepared by
extracting cinnamon bark with organic
solvent. Oleoresin yield varies from 10 to 12
per cent. The oleoresin is dispersed on sugar,
salt and used for flavouring processed foods.
Cinnamon bark oil
A pale yellow liquid possessing the
delicate aroma of the spice is obtained by
steam distillation of quills (0.2 to 0.5 per cent).
Its major component is cinnamaldehyde
(55 per cent) but other components like
eugenol, eugenyl acetate, ketones, esters and
terpenes also impart the characteristic odour
and flavour to this oil. Cinnamon bark oil is
used in flavouring bakery foods, sauces,
pickles, confectionery, soft drinks, dental and
pharmaceutical preparations and also in
perfumery.
Cinnamon leaf oil
Cinnamon leaf oil is produced by steam
distillation of leaves yielding 0.5 to 0.7 per cent
oil. It is yellow to brownish yellow in colour
and possesses a warm, spicy but rather harsh
odour. The major constituent is eugenol
(70 to 90 per cent) while the cinnamaldehyde
content is less than five per cent. The oil is
used in perfumery and flavouring and also as
a source of eugenol.
Cinnamon root bark oil
The root bark contains 1.0 to 2.8 per cent
oil containing camphor as the main constituent.
Cinnamaldehyde as well as traces of
eugenol are found in the oil, having less
commercial relevance.
Plant protection
Leaf spot and dieback disease
(Colletotrichum gloeosporioides)
On young nursery seedlings, small brown
specks appear which gradually enlarge
resulting in drying of the leaf. From the leaves,
the infection spreads to the stem, resulting in
necrosis from the apex downwards.
On old seedlings and mature trees, light and
dark brown concentric zonation occurs.
Spraying 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture during
rainy season controls the disease.
The other diseases of cinnamon include grey
blight caused by Pestalotiopsis palmarum,
sooty mould caused by Phragmocapnius sp.
and algal leaf spot by Cephaleuros sp.
suited for the cultivation of the crop.
Selection of site
Select partially shaded sites having
adequate protection from high winds. Avoid
exposed and shady locations.
 CINNAMON AND CLOVE
126
Seeds and sowing
Clove is propagated through seeds
obtained from fully developed fruits known as
mother of clove. Collect fully developed fruits
from high yielding mother trees. Dehusk the
fruits immediately after collection by soaking
in water and peeling. Prepare raised nursery
beds with fertile soil rich in humus under the
shade of trees. Sow the seeds flat at a depth
2-5 cm and a spacing of 12-15 cm. Water the
beds regularly. Seedlings can either be retained
in the nursery till they attain a height of 25-30 cm
when they are ready for transplanting or
potted when they are six months old and
transplanted after another 12-18 months.
Planting
Select 18 months old seedlings for
planting. Prepare pits of size 60 cm x 60 cm x
60 cm at a spacing of 6 m x 6 m about a month
in advance of planting. Allow to weather. Fill
up the pits with mixture of burnt earth, compost
and topsoil. Plant the seedlings during the rainy
season, May-June or August-September.
Provide shade and irrigation during breaks in
the monsoon and summer. Banana or glyricidia
may be planted to provide shade.
Clove is generally grown as a mixed crop
with coffee, coconut, arecanut etc.
Manuring
Apply cattle manure or compost at the rate
of 15 kg per tree  per annum during
May-June. The recommended fertilizer dose
is N:P2O5: K2O @ 20:18:50 g per plant
during the first year and  @ 40:36:100 g per
plant during the second year. Increase gradually
the  dose to 300:250:750 g per plant per year
for a well grown tree of 15 years or more.
Apply organic manures in May-June with the
commencement of southwest monsoon. Apply
fertilizers in two equal split doses in May-June
along with the organic manures and in
September-October in shallow trenches dug
around the plant about 1 to 1.25 m away from
the base.
After cultivation
Conduct weeding and intercultivation
whenever necessary. Cut and remove dead and
diseased branches of fully grown trees to
prevent over crowding. Spray one per cent
Bordeaux mixture to control dieback.
Harvesting and curing
The trees begin to yield from 7-8 years after
planting. The stage of harvest of flower buds
determine the quality of the final dried product.
Buds are harvested when the base of calyx
has turned from green to pink in colour. If
allowed to develop beyond this stage, the buds
open, petals drop and an inferior quality spice
is obtained on drying.
Prior to drying, buds are removed from the
stem by holding the cluster in one hand and
pressing it against the palm of the other with a
slight twisting movement. The clove buds and
stems are piled separately or drying. Buds may
be sorted to remove over ripe cloves and fallen
flowers. Drying should be done immediately
after the buds are separated from the clusters.
If left too long in heaps, they ferment and the
dried spice has a whitish shriveled appearance
(khoker clove).
The traditional method of drying is by
exposing them to sun in mats. The green buds
are spread out in a thin layer on the drying
floor and are raked from time to time to
ensure the development of a uniform colour
and to prevent mould formation. In sunny
weather, drying is completed in 4-5 days
giving a bright coloured dried spice of
attractive appearance. During drying, clove
loses about two-third of its original fresh green
weight. When properly dried, it will turn bright
brown and does not bend when pressed. The
127
CLOVE
dried cloves are sorted to remove mother of
cloves and khoker cloves, bagged and stored
in a dry place. The stem after separation of
buds is dried in a similar manner as the spice,
without allowing mould formation and
fermentation.
Clove bud oil
The essential oil is obtained by steam
distillation of comminuted buds or whole cloves.
On distillation, about 17 per cent essential oil is
obtained which is a colourless or yellow liquid
possessing odour and flavour characteristic of
the spice. Finest oil contains 85-89 per cent
eugenol. Clove bud oil is used for flavouring
food and in perfumery.
Clove stem oil
Clove stem oil is obtained from dried
peduncles and stem of clove buds (5-7 per cent)
on steam distillation. The eugenol content of
the oil ranges from 90-95 per cent. This oil
possesses a coarser and woodier odour than
bud oil.
Clove leaf oil
Clove leaves on distillation yield 2-3 per cent
oil as a dark brown liquid with a harsh woody
odour. When rectified, it turns pale yellow and
smells sweeter with a eugenol content of 80 to
85 per cent.
Oleoresin
Clove oleoresin may be prepared by cold
or hot extraction of crushed spices using
organic solvents like acetone giving a
recovery of 18-22 per cent. The oleoresin is
chiefly used in perfumery and when used for
flavouring it is dispersed on salt, flour etc.
Plant protection
Pests
Infestation of shoot borer Sinoxylon sp. can
be controlled by pruning off the laterals of old
trees showing dieback symptoms. Do not allow
dried glyricidia and other twigs to
remain in the plantation, to ensure that the
beetles will not multiply on these materials and
subsequently initiate infestation in cloves.
Diseases
Leaf spot, twig blight and flower bud
shedding (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides)
Three types of symptoms are seen viz., leaf
spot, twig blight and flower bud shedding. On
the leaves, necrotic spots of variable sizes and
shapes are noticed. Severely affected leaves
wither, drop and dry up. In the nursery
seedlings, dieback symptoms are seen.
Extension of the symptoms from the leaves
through petioles results in the infection of twigs.
The affected branches stand without leaves
or only with young leaves at the tips. The
flower buds are attacked by spread of infection
from the twigs. Shedding of flower buds occur
during periods of heavy and continuous
rainfall.
Management
Spraying 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture at
1-1.5 month intervals reduces disease intensity,
defoliation and flower bud shedding. The
spraying has to be commenced just prior to
flower bud formation and continued till the
harvest of flower buds for effective control.
Destruction of the weed Clerodendron from
the clove garden is recommended to reduce
the disease since the pathogen survives on this
weed during adverse conditions.
The other diseases of clove are:
Grey blight of clove (Pestalotia palmarum),
Leaf spot of clove (Cylindrocladium
quinqueseptatum), Leaf spot of clove
(Alternaria citri), Sooty mould of clove
(Phragmocapnius sp.), Algal leaf spot of
clove (Cephaleuros sp.).

128
VANILLA  (Vanilla  planifolia)
Vanilla is a tropical orchid requiring a warm
climate with frequent rains, preferring an
annual rainfall of 150-300 cm. Uncleared jungle
areas are ideal for establishing vanilla
plantations. In such locations, it would be
necessary to retain the natural shade provided
by lofty trees and to leave the soil or the rich
humus layer on the top undisturbed. Vanilla is
cultivated on varied type of soils from sandy
loam to laterites. It requires filtered sunlight.
In the absence of natural shade, trees should
be grown to provide shade.
Preparation of land
Clear the land of jungle growth and
prepare for planting. Being a creeper, the plant
requires support up to a height of about 130-
135 cm. Cuttings of Plumaria alba, Erythrina
lithosperma, Jatropha carcas and Glyricidia
maculata are suitable as live supports. The
growth of live standard is to be adjusted to
make them branch at a height of 120-150 cm
to facilitate trailing of the vines and artificial
hand pollination.
Time and method of planting
Vanilla is propagated by planting shoot
cuttings in situ. Plant cuttings of 60 cm length.
Longer cuttings bear earlier than shorter
cuttings. Rooted cuttings as well as tissue
culture derived plants can also be used for
planting.
Plant the cutting with the onset of
monsoon rains. Set out the cutting at a
spacing of 2.7 m between plants and 1.8 m
between rows in pits of size 40 cm x 40 cm x
40 cm. Trail the vines on the live supports and
when they attain a height of 135 cm trail them
horizontally on bamboo poles tied to
vertical supports or branches of support plants
in loops touching the ground.
Manuring
Being a surface rooting plant, manuring
should be confined to the surface layer of soil.
Provide heavy and frequent mulching to the
vines. Apply 120 g of N in the form of leaf
mould or FYM in two split doses in June-July
and September-October.
After cultivation
Vanilla cannot withstand even the
slightest root disturbance. Hence remove
weeds from the plant base by hand weeding
and use them as mulch.
Being closely planted, no intercrops are
raised in a pure plantation of vanilla. But
vanilla can be planted as an intercrop in
coffee, coconut, arecanut etc.
Pollination, harvesting and curing
Flowering of vine commences usually
by about the third year. The inflorescence is
produced in the leaf axils. There is a
tendency for some of the vines to maintain only
vegetative growth. A light nipping off or pruning
of the terminal shoots hastens flowering. Due
to the peculiar structure of the flowers, self-
pollination is not possible. Hence hand
pollination is adopted for fruit set. Best time
for pollinating the flowers is between 6 am and
1 pm and a success of 80-85 per cent can be
obtained. Successful fertilization is indicated
by the retention of calyx and the stigma even
after four days of pollination.
The pods ripen in about 9-11 months time.
Before attaining maturity the fruit is dark green
in colour and when ripe yellowing commences
from the tip of the pod. Collect the pods at this
time, as this is the optimum time for harvesting
the pod. If allowed to remain on the vine further,

GINGER (Zingiber officinale)
Ginger is a tropical plant adapted for
cultivation even in regions of subtropical
climate such as the high ranges. It prefers a
rich soil with high humus content. Being
an exhausting crop, ginger is not cultivated
continuously in the same field but shifting
cultivation is practised. The crop cannot
withstand waterlogging and hence soils with
good drainage are preferred for its cultivation.
It is shade tolerant / loving crop with shallow
roots and therefore suitable for intercropping
and as a component in the homesteads where
low to medium shade is available.
the pods split. Free vanillin is not present in the
beans when they are harvested. Beans do not
have the aroma at this stage. Vanillin is
developed as a result of enzyme action on a
glycoside  during the process of curing of
beans.
Curing of vanilla involves immersing the
beans (2-3 days after harvest) in hot water at
a temperature of 63 to 65oC for three
minutes for the cessation of vegetative life.
After a rapid drying on woolen blankets, when
the beans are still very hot, they are kept in
chests lined with blankets. Next day they are
spread out in sun on blanket for three to four
hours and rolled up to retain the heat.
Repeat this for six to eight days during which
beans lose their weight, become supple and
can be twisted on finger without breaking. This
is followed by slow drying in the shade for a
period of two to three months. Properly dried
beans are kept in trunks where the fragrance
is fully developed. Finally, they are graded
according to size and bundled and placed in
iron boxes lined with paraffin paper. The
vanillin content of properly cured beans will
be about 2.5 per cent.
Plant protection
The occurrence of a wilt disease caused
by Fusarium oxysporum has been observed.
For control of wilt disease adopt the
following measures.
1. Remove diseased plants along with
surrounding soil where the disease is
observed.
2. Remove weeds around the plants.
3. Mulch the base of the vine with dry leaves
before and after monsoon.
4. Avoid injury to roots during cultivation.
5. Drench soil around the base of vine with
1 per cent Bordeaux mixture.
Fungal diseases like shoot tip rot, stem and
bean rot caused by Phytophthora sp. as well
as immature bean drop are noticed. The
disease affected portions are to be removed
regularly and 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture
should be applied on the affected plants.

Preparation of land
Clear the field during February-March and
burn the weeds, stubbles, roots etc.
in situ. Prepare the land by ploughing or
digging. Prepare beds of convenient length
(across the slope where the land is undulating),
1 m width, 25 cm height with 40 cm
spacing between the beds. Provide drainage
channels, one for every 25 beds on flat lands.

Planting material
Ginger rhizomes are used for planting. For
selection and preservation of seeds, adopt the
following methods:
Mark healthy and disease free plants
in the field when the crop is 6-8 months old
and still green. Select best rhizomes free from
pest and disease from the marked plants.
Handle seed rhizomes carefully to avoid
damage to buds. Soak the selected rhizomes
for 30 minutes in a solution of mancozeb
and malathion to give terminal concentration
of 0.3 per cent for the former and 0.1 per cent
for the latter. Dry the treated rhizomes in shade
by spreading on the floor. Store the treated
rhizomes in pits dug under shade, the floor of
which is lined with sand or saw dust. It is
advisable to spread layers of leaves of
Glycosmis pentaphylla (panal). Cover the pits
with coconut fronds.
Examine the stored rhizomes at monthly
intervals and remove the rhizomes that show
signs of rotting. This will help to keep the
inoculum level low. Provide one or two holes
for better aeration. Treat the seed rhizomes
similarly before planting also.
Single bud sprout transplanting: A
transplanting technique using single bud sprouts
(about 5g) has been standardized to produce
good quality planting material with reduced
cost.

yielding varieties of ginger.
• Treating the seed rhizome with mancozeb
(0.3 %) and quinalphos (0.075%) for
30 min. before storage.
• Preparation of single bud sprouts (4-6 g)
by cutting ginger rhizomes and
• Treatment of single bud sprouts with
mancozeb 0.3%, for 30 minutes before
planting after 30 days.
For raising sprouts, 98 well pro-trays and
nursery medium of partially decomposed coir
pith and vermicompost in the ratio of  3:1 are
recommended. The advantages are less
planting material requirement, 500-750 kg per
ha, 98 – 100 per cent field establishment, high
cost: benefit ratio and suitability for early/
delayed planting and high production
technology.
Season and method of planting
The best time for planting ginger is
during the first fortnight of April, after
receipt of pre-monsoon showers. For irrigated
ginger, the best suited time for planting is middle
of February (for vegetable ginger).
Plant rhizome bits of 15 g weight in small
pits at a spacing of 20 cm x 20 cm to
25 cm x 25 cm and at a depth of 4-5 cm with
at least one viable healthy bud facing
upwards.
Seed rate
1500 kg ha-1
Manuring
Apply   20 t FYM + 2 t Neem cake + 1 t
Ash + 4 t vermicompost/ha.  Also use
Azospirillum and P-Solubilising bacteria
(20 g/bed of 3 x 1 m) as nutrient supplement.
Drench the beds with PGPR GRB 35
(Bacillus amyloliquifacians)  for growth
promotion and suppression of soft rot disease.
Apply manures and fertilizers at the
following rates:
FYM
30 t ha-1
N:P2O5:K2O
75:50:50: kg/ha/year
Full dose of P2O5 and 50 per cent of K2O
may be applied as basal. Half the quantity of
N may be applied 60 days after planting. The
remaining quantity of N and K2O may be
applied 120 days after planting.
Mulching
Immediately after planting, mulch the beds
thickly with green leaves @ 15 t ha-1. Repeat
mulching with green leaves twice
@ 7.5 t ha-1 first 44-60 days and second
90-120 days after planting. Grow green
manure crops like daincha and sun hemp in
the interspaces of beds, along with ginger and
harvest the green manure crop during
second mulching of ginger beds.
Application of dried coconut leaves as
mulch in ginger beds after removing the petiole
at the time of planting is also recommended.
Dried coconut leaves after removing the
petiole, split into two at midrib @ 8 kg/ 3 x1 m/
bed or 5400 kg ha-1 for effective weed control
in ginger. Subsequent application of green leaf
at 45 & 90 DAP is not required. This
environment friendly technology recorded 87%
weed control efficiency, less incidence of soft
rot incidence (8.7%) with a B:C ratio 1.97
compared to unweeded control with no
mulching.
After cultivation
Remove weeds by hand weeding before
each mulching. Repeat weeding according to
weed growth during the fifth and sixth month
after planting. Earth up the crop during the first
mulching and avoid water stagnation.
Plant protection
For managing shoot borer following
measures are recommended
1. Spray Beauveria bassiana @ 5 X 108
conidia/ml and Chlorantraniliprole 18.5%
SC at 0.005 per cent.
2. Spray dimethoate or quinalphos at 0.05 per
cent.
3. Spray neem oil (5 ml l-1 of water) in
combination with the cultural control
recommended for shoot borer.
For the management of rhizome rot,
bacterial wilt and fusarium yellows of ginger
the following practices are recommended:
• Soil application of Bleaching powder (15g)
+ lime (250g 3m2) – ATP, 2MAP, 4 MAP
• Rhizome treatment with mancozeb
(3 g l-1) for 30 min. + Soil application of
bleaching powder (15 g) + lime (250 g
3 m2 bed) -2 MAP & 4 MAP
• Seed treatment/Soil application of
Pseudomonoas fluorescens (2%) +
cowdung supernatant (2%)-ATP, 2MAP,
4MAP
• PGPM – Seed treatment/soil appli-
cation - ATP, 2MAP, 4MAP
4.
Adopt the following to control Rhizome
rot and Fusarium yellow.
a. Select sites having proper drainage.
b. Select seed rhizomes from disease free
areas.
c. Treat seed rhizomes with 0.3 per cent
mancozeb.
d. When incidence of rhizome rot is noted
in the field, dig out the affected plants
GINGER
132
and drench the beds with cheshunt
compound or 1.0 per cent Bordeaux
mixture or 0.3 per cent mancozeb.
e. Inoculation with native arbuscular
mycorrhiza, 
Trichoderma 
and
Pseudomonas fluorescens at the time
of planting is recommended as a
biocontrol measure.
5. For controlling the leaf spot disease,
1 per cent Bordeaux mixture, 0.3 per cent
mancozeb or 0.2 per cent thiram may be
sprayed.
6. For control of nematode in endemic area,
apply neem cake @ 1.0 t ha-1 at planting
followed by application of neem cake @
1.0 t ha-1 at 45 days after planting (DAP).
Harvesting and processing
For vegetable ginger, the crop can be
harvested from sixth month onwards. For dry
ginger, harvest the crop between 245-260 days.
After harvest, the fibrous roots attached to the
rhizomes are trimmed off and soil is removed
by washing. Rhizomes are soaked in water
overnight and then cleaned. The skin is
removed by scrapping with sharp bamboo splits
or such other materials. Never use metallic
substances since they will discolour the
rhizomes. After scrapping, the rhizomes are
sun dried for a week with frequent turnings.
They are again  rubbed well by hand to remove
any outer skin.
Ginger oil
Ginger oil is prepared commercially by
steam distillation of dried powdered ginger. The
yield of oil varies from 1.3 to 3.0 per cent. The
major use of ginger oil is as a flavouring agent
for beverages, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic.
Ginger oleoresin
Oleoresin from ginger is obtained
conventionally by extraction of dried powdered
ginger with organic solvents like ethyl acetate,
ethanol or acetone. Commercial dried ginger
yields 3.5-10.0 per cent oleoresin. Ginger
oleoresin is a dark brown viscous liquid
responsible for the flavour and pungency of
the spice.

GINGER AND MANGO GINGER
MANGO GINGER (Curcuma amada)
It is an under exploited spice crop, which
grows luxuriantly in tropical soils with good
drainage. The rhizomes of mango ginger are
used for preparing pickles, chutney, preserve,
candy, sauce and salad and in meat and other
culinary preparations. The rhizome has
excellent medicinal properties and finds
extensive use in the indigenous system of
medicine. It is, appetizer, antipyretic,
aphrodisiac and laxative. It is useful in
biliousness, itching, skin diseases, bronchitis,
asthma, hiccough and inflammation due to
injuries. The rhizomes and roots are
carminative and stomachic and in crushed pulp
form they are applied over contusions, sprains
and bruises for rapid healing.
Mango ginger is botanically related to
neither mango nor ginger, but to turmeric
(Curcuma longa). Morphologically mango
ginger plant is similar to turmeric, but has
shorter crop duration of six months. The
rhizomes are pale yellow inside with lighter
colour outside, have sweet smell of unripe
mango when crushed. The crop comes up well
in open conditions, but tolerates low levels of
NUTMEG  (Myristica  fragrans)
Nutmeg requires a hot, humid climate
without pronounced dry season. The soil should
be rich in organic matter and well drained. The
tree prefers partial shade. Sheltered valleys are
the best suited. It can be grown up to about
900 m above MSL.
Variety: IISR-Viswashree
Seeds and sowing
Fully ripe tree-burst fruits are selected for
shade and therefore partially shaded situations
can also be utilized for its cultivation. It can be
well accommodated as an intercrop in coconut
gardens and in rotation with other short duration
crops like vegetables and also as a crop
component in homesteads.
Preparation of land
Prepare the land to a good tilth during
February-March subject to the availability of
pre-monsoon showers. Prepare beds of
convenient length, 1.2 m width, 25 cm height
and 40 cm spacing between beds.
Seed material and varieties
Whole or split mother rhizomes or well
developed, healthy and disease free finger
rhizomes weighing 15-20 g are suitable for
planting. In Kerala, local varieties are used for
cultivation. Amba is a released variety from
High Altitude Research Station, Pottangi,
Orissa.
Season and method of planting
Plant during April with the commencement
of pre-monsoon showers. Take small pits in
the beds with a spacing of 25 cm x 30 cm and
at a depth of 4-5 cm. Adopt a seed rate of
1500 kg ha-1.
Manuring
Apply cattle manure or compost as basal
MANGO GINGER AND NUTMEG
134
dose @ 30-40 t ha-1, spread over the beds and
mix well. Apply N:P2O5:K2O fertilizer @
30:30:60 kg ha-1. Full dose of P2O5 and half
dose of K2O may be applied as basal. Apply
two-third dose of nitrogen 30 days
after planting and remaining N and K2O at
60 days after planting.
Mulching
Mulch the crop immediately after planting
with green leaves @ 15 t ha-1. Repeat mulching
after 50 days with same quantity of green
leaves.
After cultivation
The rhizomes germinate within 3-4 weeks.
Remove weeds 45 days after planting and
repeat if necessary. Earth up the crop after
60 days of planting.
Plant protection
Compared to the related crops ginger and
turmeric, the crop is free from pests and
diseases. But when large scale cultivation is
taken up, the attack of shoot borer
(Conogethes punctiferalis) causes damage
to the crop. Appearance of dead heart in the
field is the main symptom. To reduce the pest
population, pull out the dead hearts with the
larvae inside and burn it. If infestation is
severe, spray dimethoate or quinalphos at
0.05per cent.
raising seedlings. The fleshy rind and the mace
are removed before sowing. The seeds should
be sown immediately after collection. If there
is any delay in sowing, the seeds should be
kept in baskets filled with damp soil. The
seedbeds of 100-120 cm width, 15 cm height
and of convenient length may be prepared in
cool and shady places. A mixture of garden
soil and sand in the ratio 3:1 may be used for
preparing nursery beds. Over this, sand is
spread to a thickness of 2-3 cm and the seeds
dibbled 2 cm below the surface at a spacing of
about 12 cm on either side. Seeds germinate
within 50-80 days after sowing. When the
plumule produces two elongated opposite
leaves, the seedlings are to be transferred from
beds to polybags.
Vegetative propagation of nutmeg through
epicotyl grafting is recommended for all
nutmeg nurseries.
Planting
Since the nutmeg trees require shade,
suitable fast growing shade trees like Albizia,
Erythrina etc. are planted in advance.
Banana can also be grown as a shade crop in
the early stages. Pits of 90 cm x 90 cm x
90 cm are dug at a spacing of 8 m x 8 m with
the onset of southwest monsoon. The pits are
filled with topsoil and compost or well
decomposed cattle manure and seedlings are
planted.
Manuring
Apply 10 kg cattle manure or compost per
seedling during the first year. Increase the
quantity gradually till a well grown tree of
15 years and above receives 50 kg of
organic manures per year. Apply N:P2O5:K2O
@ 20:18:50 g/plant during the first year. This
may be doubled in the next year. Gradually
increase the N:P2O5:K2O dose to 500:250:1000
g/plant/year to obtain full dose from 15th year
onwards.
Harvesting
Fruits are available throughout the year, but
the peak period of harvest is from
June to July. When fruits are fully ripe, the nuts
split open. These are either plucked from the
tree or allowed to drop. The two major products
are nutmeg and mace. Dried nutmeg and mace
135
NUTMEG
are directly used as spice and also for the
preparation of their derivatives.
After de-rinding the nutmeg fruit, red
feathery aril (mace) is separated from pericarp.
The mace is detached, flattened and sun dried
on mats for 3-5 days or in artificial heat drier.
The nuts are sun dried for four to eight
weeks or in artificial heat drier until kernel
rattle inside the shell. They are stored in warm
dry place prior to shelling.
Oleoresin
Nutmeg and mace oleoresins are prepared
by extracting the ground spice with organic
solvents. Yield of oleoresin is 10-12 per cent
for nutmeg and 10-13 per cent for mace. Mace
oleoresin possesses a fine, fresh fruity
character.
Nutmeg butter
Nutmeg contains 25-40 per cent of fixed
oil that can be obtained by pressing the crushed
nuts between plates in the presence of steam
or by extracting with solvents. The product,
known as nutmeg butter, is a highly aromatic,
orange coloured fat with the consistency of
butter at ambient temperature.
Nutmeg oil
This is obtained as pale yellow to white
volatile liquid possessing a fresh warm
aromatic odour. The yield ranges from 7 to 16
per cent. The unshelled nuts are coarsely
crushed in a mechanical cracker and steam
distilled.
Mace oil
The mace yields 4-17 per cent colourless
to pale yellow liquid possessing organoleptic
properties similar to nutmeg oil. Nutmeg and
mace oil are also used for flavouring.
BLACK PEPPER (Piper nigrum)
Pepper requires a warm and humid
climate. Though an annual rainfall of 250 cm
is ideal for the proper growth of the crop, it
can also come up well in low rainfall
areas, if the pattern and distribution of rainfall
are conducive.  About 70 mm of rainfall within
a period of 20 days may be sufficient for
triggering of flushing and flowering
process in the plant, but once the process is
set on, there should be continuous,  rainfall
until fruit development starts.  Any dry spell,
even for a few days, within this critical
period will result in substantial reduction of
yield.  Very long spells of dry weather are
unfavourable for the crop growth.
The plant tolerates a minimum
temperature of 10oC and maximum of 40oC,
Pests
The hard scale Saissetia nigra occurs on
the pencil thick branches and desaps the
tissues. The infested shoots invariably
develop sooty mould cover. It can be
controlled by spot spraying with quinalphos
0.025 per cent.
Diseases
Leaf spot and die back (Colletotrichum
gloeosporioides)
Sunken spots surrounded by a yellow halo
are the initial symptoms. Subsequently the
central portion of the necrotic region drops off
resulting in shot hole symptoms. Dieback
symptoms are also observed in some of the
mature branches. On young seedlings
drying of the leaves and subsequent
defoliation are seen. The disease can be
NUTMEG AND BLACK PEPPER
136
controlled by spraying 1 per cent Bordeaux
mixture two or three times during rainy
season.
Fruit rot
This is caused by Colletotrichum
gloeosporioides 
and 
Botryodiplodia
theobromae. Water soaked lesions are seen
on the fruits, the tissues of which become
discoloured and disintegrated. Premature
splitting of the pericarp and rotting of mace
and seed are the main symptoms of the
disease. The internal tissues are found
rotten. The fallen fruits become enveloped with
the growth of the organism. The disease can
be controlled by spraying 1 per cent Bordeaux
mixture.
Other diseases: Phytophthora leaf fall,
white thread blight, horse hair blight, sooty
mould and algal leaf spot.
the optimum being 20 - 30oC.  It can be grown
from sea level upto an altitude of 1200 m.
Pepper prefers a light porous and well-
drained soil rich in organic matter.  Water
stagnation in the soil, even for a very short
period, is injurious for the plant.  So, heavy
textured soils in locations where drainage
facilities are inadequate should be avoided.
Varieties
Improved varieties : Panniyur-1, Panniyur-2,
Panniyur-3, Panniyur-4, Panniyur-5,
Panniyur-6, Panniyur-7, Panniyur-8, Vijay,
Subhakara, Sreekara, Panchami, Pournami,
Girimunda and Malabar Excel. IISR
Sakthi and IISR Thevam are tolerant to
Phytophthora foot rot.
Local varieties: Karimunda, Neelamundi,
Kottanadan, Kuthiravally, Arakulam
Munda, Balankotta and Kalluvally.
Selection of site
Sites with slight to moderate slope are ideal
for pepper cultivation, as they promote
drainage. Slopes facing south are to be avoided
as far as possible.  When such slopes are to
be used for cultivation, the young plants may
be sufficiently protected from the scorching
sun during summer.
Selection of mother plants
Cultivate  varieties, which are proven to be
highly productive.  Select mother plants, which
give regularly high yields and possess other
desirable attributes such as vigorous growth,
maximum number of spikes per unit area, long
spikes, close setting of berries, disease
tolerance etc. Selected mother plants should
be in the age group of 5-12 years.  Mark and
label selected mother plants in October-
November.
Raising of rooted cuttings
Pepper is propagated vegetatively from
cuttings. Select runner shoots produced at the
base of mother plants and keep them coiled
and raised to prevent from striking roots in the
soil. Separate them from the vines in
February-March.Very tender and too hard
portions of the shoots are to be avoided for
planting. The shoots are cut into pieces with
2-3 nodes in each. Two node semi-hard wood
cuttings are to be planted for rooting of pepper
cuttings. Leaves, if any, are to be clipped off
leaving a small portion of the petioles on the
stem. Satisfactory rooting and survival of
cuttings (over 70 per cent) could be achieved
even without any hormone treatment. Plant
the cuttings in polythene bags  filled with potting
mixture. The potting mixture is prepared by
mixing two parts of fertile topsoil, one part of
137
BLACK PEPPER
river sand and one part of well rotten cattle
manure. Substituting granite powder (a waste
material from stone quarries) for sand in
conventional potting mixture (2:1:1) is good for
growth of pepper cuttings and is economical.
Recommended for black pepper nurseries for
large scale multiplication. Solarized potting
mixture supplemented with nutrient solution
(urea, superphosphate, MOP and magnesium
sulphate in 4:3:2:1 ratio) and fortified with
biocontrol consortia  promotes growth and
helps in production of disease free rooted
cuttings. When polythene bags are used,
sufficient number of holes (16-20) may be
provided at the base to ensure good drainage.
The cuttings should be planted at least one node
deep in the soil.  The cutting after planting
should be kept under good shade.  In large
nurseries, pandals are to be constructed for
this purpose. The cuttings are to be well
protected from direct sunlight and frequent
watering is recommended in the nursery to
maintain a humid and cool atmosphere around
the cuttings. Watering 2-3 times a day is
sufficient.  Heavy watering, which makes the
soil slushy and causes water logging is to be
avoided.
Partially composted coir pith and
vermicompost (75:25) enriched with Tricho-
derma (in talc formulation, 107 cfu g-1 at the
rate of 10 g kg-1) is found to be an ideal potting
medium for black pepper nursery for healthy
planting material production using plug-trays
(cell dimension of 7.5 x 7.5 x 10.0 cm)
compared to conventional multiplication. It
reduces the incidence of soil born diseases and
aids easy transportation of seedlings.
Serpentine method of propagation
Three node cuttings planted in polythene
bags are kept in a corner of the nursery.  When
the plant develops two leaves they are trailed
horizontally in polythene bags containing
potting mixture kept below each tender node.
Each node will be pressed into the mixture with
polythene bags with ‘V’ shaped midribs of
coconut leaves.  As new shoots arise these
will be trailed horizontally in polythene bags
containing potting mixture.  Upward growth
of cutting is not arrested.  Once twenty nodes
get rooted first 10 bags in the rooted nodes
will be separated by cutting at the inter nodes.
The inter nodal stub will be pushed back into
the potting mixture.  These stubs also produce
a second root system.  Daily irrigation is to be
given using a rose can. After three months it
will be ready for planting in the main field. On
an average 60 cuttings will be obtained in a
year by this method from each mother cutting.
Recommended in black pepper nurseries for
large scale multiplication.
Field planting
Planting of standards is to be taken up in
April-May with the onset of pre-monsoon
showers. Karayam or Killingil (Garuga
pinnata), Matti/Pongalyam (Ailanthus sp.),
subabul (Leucaenea leucocephala) etc. are
suitable standards for growing pepper.
Acacia auriculiformis and Artocarpus
heterophyllus are two multipurpose support
tree species suitable for block cultivation of
black pepper (Piper nigrum L.). Pepper yields
are promising when trees are grown in high
density (3 x 3m spacing; 1111 trees ha-1) block
plantations. Both the tree species provide
additional economic returns through timber
yield at final harvest. Because of prevalence
of Erythrina gall wasp avoid using  Erythrina
as standard. Only species tolerant to Erythrina
gall wasp is Erythrina variegata (heavily
throny). In high altitude areas, dadap (E.
lithosperma) and Silver oak (Grevillea
robusta) can be successfully used as standard
for pepper.  Seedlings of subabul and silver
oak are to be planted 2-3 years before planting
pepper.  The cuttings of standards are to be
planted in narrow holes of 40 to 50 cm depth.
The spacing recommended is 3 m x 3 m on
plain lands and 2 m between plants in rows
across the slope and 4 m between rows on
sloppy lands.  The soil should be  pressed well
around the standards to avoid air pockets and
keep the standards firm in the soil.
For planting pepper, prepare pits on the
northern side of standards, 15 cm away from
it.  The pit size should be 50 cm x 50 cm x
50 cm. Fill the pits with a mixture of top soil
and compost or well rotten cattle manure @
5 kg per pit and 50 g of Trichoderma. With
the onset of south west monsoon in June-July,
plant 2 rooted cuttings in the pits at a distance
of about 30 cm away from the standards.  Press
the soil around the cuttings and form a small
mound slopping outward and away from the
cuttings to prevent water stagnation around the
plants.  The growing portions of the cuttings
are to be trailed and tied to the standards.
Provide shade to the plants if the land is
exposed and if there is a break in the rainfall.
When pepper is trailed on arecanut, plant the
cuttings 1.0 m away from palm and 1.5 m when
coconut is used as the support. Trail the pepper
vines on a temporary stake for 1-2 years.
When they attain sufficient length to reach the
tree trunk, remove the stake without causing
damage to the vines and tie the pepper plants
on to the tree trunk and trail them on it.
Management after planting
If the terrain of the land is sloppy or
uneven, carry out contour bunding or
terracing to prevent soil erosion.  Carry out
digging around the standards and vines at a
radius of about 1 m from the base or in the
entire plantation, twice during the year, the first
at the onset of southwest monsoon and the
second towards the end of northeast
monsoon. Weeding around the plants is to be
done according to necessity.  However, in foot
BLACK PEPPER
138
rot affected gardens, digging should be avoided
and weeds are removed by slashing.  In the
early stages, tie the vines to the standards, if
found necessary.
Where pepper is grown in large areas,
growing of cover crops like Calapagonium
muconoides is recommended.  When such
cover crops are grown, they are to be cut back
regularly from the base of the plants to prevent
them from twining along with the pepper vines.
Lowering of vines after one year’s growth will
promote lateral branch production.
Intercropping of pepper gardens with
ginger, turmeric, colocasia and elephant foot
yam is advantageous.  Banana as an intercrop
in yielding gardens reduces pepper yield.
Therefore, this is not recommended beyond
three to four years after planting of pepper
vines.  However, in the early years, banana
provides shade to the young plants and
protects them from drying up during summer
months.
When pepper is grown in open places,
shading and watering of the young seedlings
may be done during summer months for the
first 1 to 3 years according to necessity.  The
young plants may be completely covered with
dry arecanut leaves, coconut leaves or twigs
of trees until summer months are over.
Mulching the basins of pepper vines during
summer months is highly advantageous.  Saw
dust, arecanut husk and dry leaves are
suitable mulching materials.  Removal of
unwanted terminal shoot growths and
hanging shoots should be done as and when
necessary.
Prune and train the standards in March-
April every year to remove excessive
overgrowth and to give them a proper shape.
The effective height of the standard is to be
limited to about 6 m.  A second pruning of the
standards may be done in July-August, if there
is excessive shade in the garden. PGPM soil
application (50 g/vine) and spraying (2%) with
consortium of PGPM helps to prevent
phytophthora foot rot infestation.
Underplanting
After regular bearing for about 20 years,
the vines of most varieties start declining in
yield.  The age of decline in yield varies with
variety and agroclimatic and management
factors.  So underplanting should be attempted
at about 20 years after planting or when a
declining trend in yield appears.  The old and
senile vines can be removed 3-5 years after
underplanting depending upon the growth of the
young vines.
Manuring
Manuring for pepper vines is to be done in
basins taken around the plant, 10-15 cm deep
and 30-40 cm radius, depending upon the
growth of the plants.  Apply cattle
manure / compost / green leaves @10 kg/ plant
/ annum just at the onset of southwest monsoon
and cover lightly with soil.  It is desirable to
apply lime at the rate of 500 g/vine in April-
May, with the receipt of pre-monsoon showers,
in alternate years.
Apply 10 kg FYM + 500g Neem cake +
500 g ash+ 2 kg vermicompost with bioferti-
lizer – Azospirillum & P solubilizing
bacteria (20g).
Apply PGPR Consortia (50 g) consisting
of 2 spp. of Micrococcus and I sp. of
Enterobacter per vine which helps in growth
promotion and disease suppression.
Recommended nutrient dosage for
pepper (3 years and above) is:
N:P2O5:K2O g/vine/year
50:50:150 (general recommendation)
50:50:200 (for Panniyur and similar
areas)
139
BLACK PEPPER
140:55:275 (for Kozhikode and similar
areas)
Note: Apply 1/3 dose for one year old plants
and 1/2 dose for two year old plants.
The fertilizers may be applied in two split
doses, the first in May-June with the receipt
of a few soaking rains and the second in
August-September. Apply fertilizers in a circle
of radius 30 cm around the vine in the case of
plants trailed on erythrina (Nadan murukku)
or teak pole (dead standard) soil application of
zinc @ 6 kg ha-1 as zinc sulphate or foliar spray
of Zn @ 0.5 per cent during flowering and pin
head stage of black pepper is recommended
in zinc deficient areas of black pepper
cultivation for increasing the yield and quality.
Application of molybdenum @ 1 kg ha-1 is
recommended for areas deficient in soil
molybdenum availability.
Irrigation
Irrigating pepper plants of Panniyur-1
variety at IW/CPE ratio of 0.25 from
November / December till the end of March
and withholding irrigation thereafter till
monsoon break, increases pepper yield by
about 50 per cent. The depth of irrigation
recommended is 10 mm (100 litres of water
per vine per irrigation at an interval of about
8-10 days under Panniyur conditions). The
water is to be applied in basins taken around
the plants at a radius of 75 cm. The basins
may be mulched with dry leaves or other
suitable materials. The irrigation schedule for

pot of N, P2O5 and K2O respectively at
bimonthly interval.  Alternatively, application
of 15 g groundnut cake or 33 g of neem cake
can also meet the N requirement of the crop.
The bushy nature of the plant will have to be
ensured by proper pruning of the viny growth.
The potted plants are to be kept preferably
under partial shade. It is necessary that
re-potting is carried out after every two years.
Irrigating black pepper vines with 8 litres
of water through drip per day during
Oct - May enhances yield and quality in bush
pepper with high B:C ratio. Recommended for
bush pepper grown as intercrop in coconut
gardens.
Plant protection
Pests
For the control of pollu caused by the flea
beetle Longitarsus nigripennis, spray any one
of the following insecticides namely,
dimethoate or quinalphos at 0.05 per cent
concentration.  The spraying is to be given at
the time of spike emergence (June-July), at
berry formation (September-October) and
once again at berry maturing stage, if needed.
It can also be controlled by spraying
cypermethrin 0.01 per cent twice, first at the
berry formation stage and the second
one-month after the first spray (Sept.-Oct.).
For controlling pepper leaf gall thrips,
dimethoate 0.05 per cent may be used.
Three different types of scale insects are
found infesting black pepper in high ranges of
Idukki district. They are black pepper mussel
scale (Lepidosaphes piperis Gr.) infesting all
parts of vines, coconut scale (Aspidiotus
destructor Sign) feeding from undersurface
of leaf and soft scale Marsipococcus
marsupiale Gr. confining to upper leaf surface.
Infestation by mussel scale causes significant
loss of yield as it affects all parts of plant
including berries.
Two sprayings of dimethoate 0.05 per cent
at fortnightly intervals after the harvest of
berries effectively control black pepper
mussel scale.
Soft scale (Lecanium sp.) is occasionally
found to infest the foliage and vines at higher
elevations. This scale insect can be
controlled by spraying quinalphos 0.05 per
cent.This treatment will be adequate to
control the mealy bugs also. Root mealy bugs
can be controlled by drenching the basins of
vines with chlorpyriphos 0.075 per cent.
Adequate precaution has to be taken to
ensure that the insecticide solution reaches the
root zone of the vines. Many of the vines
infested by root mealy bugs are also likely to
be infected with Phytophthora and nema-
todes. For controlling hard scale, spot
application of dimethoate 0.1 per cent is
recommended.
Two sprays of Azadiractin 5000 ppm at 15
days interval after the incidence of scale insect.
Thiamethoxam 0.013% two sprays at an
interval of 15 days after incidence of scale
insect is also  recommended.
Top shoot borer can be controlled by
spraying  dimethoate (0.05 per cent) on the
tender shoots and flushes. The spraying has to
be repeated to protect newly emerging shoots
and flushes.
For control of the burrowing nematode
Radopholus similis and the root knot
nematode Meloidogyne incognita, adopt the
following measures:
a. Use nematode free rooted cuttings for
raising new plantations.
b. Apply talc based formulation of Bacillus
macerans @ 10g/vine in basins (106 cfu/
g) at the time of planting of vines or just
before the monsoon period in established
plantations.

Drench carbosulfan 25 EC 0.1% @ 50 ml /
polybag (1.5 kg potting mixture) for the
management of plant parasitic nematodes in
black pepper nurseries. Recommended dose
of carbosulfan is compatible with Trichoderma
harzianum and Pochonia chlamydosporia.
Pochonia chlamydosporia (MTCC 5412)
bioformulation, a native nematode ant agonistic
fungus is recommended for field management
of root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne sp.)
and burrowing nematodes (to a lesser extent)
infesting black pepper plants. The mode of
application is 10 g formulation mixed with 2 kg
of well decomposed farmyard manure or
compost and applied to basin of the vine in the
field. Pochonia is compatible with copper
oxychloride and Trichoderma harzianum and
does not have any non-target effects on other
living beings.
Diseases
Phytophthora (Foot rot)
For controlling the disease, adopt the
following management practices:
Phytosanitation
All infected or dead vines along the root
system are to be removed and burnt. Wherever
water stagnation is a problem, effective
drainage of both surface and sub-soil is
to be ensured. To avoid soil splash and
consequent disease initiation and spread, a
legume cover in the plantation should be
ensured.  Runner shoots are to be pruned or
tied back to vines before the onset of
monsoon.  At the onset of monsoon, the
branches of support trees may be lopped off
to allow penetration of sunlight and avoid build
up of humidity.
Apply 1 kg lime and 2 kg neem cake per
standard per year as pre-monsoon dose.
The application of neem cake should be four
weeks after lime application.
Chemical control
For the control of Phytophthora foot rot,
any of the following control measures can be
adopted.
1. After the receipt of monsoon showers
(May-June), all the vines are to be drenched
over a radius 45-50 cm with copper
oxychloride 2 g l-1 @ 5-10 litres per vine.
This varies according to the age of the plant.
A foliar spray with 1 per cent Bordeaux
mixture is also to be given. Drenching and
spraying are to be repeated just before the
northeast  monsoon. A third round of
drenching may be given during October if
the monsoon is prolonged.
2. After the receipt of a few monsoon
showers (May-June), all the vines are to
be drenched over a radius of 45-50 cm with
(3 ml l-1) potassium phosphonate @ 5-10
litres per vine. This varies according to the
age of the plant. A foliar spray with 0.3 per
cent potassium phosphonate is also to be
given. A second drenching and spraying with
0.3 per cent potassium phosphonate is to
be repeated just before the northeast
monsoon.  If  the monsoon is prolonged, a
third round of drenching may be given
during October.
Biocontrol
Inoculate pepper vines with native
arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Trichoderma
and Pseudomonas fluorescens at the time of
planting in the nursery and field and apply during
the pre-monsoon period in the established
plantations to control foot rot.  In the field, apply
the biocontrol agents around the base of the
vine (see the chapter on biocontrol agents
against plant pathogens).
BLACK PEPPER
142
Note: 1. All chemical control measures
are prophylactic in nature and
application of chemicals in
advanced stages of disease will not
be effective in combating the
disease.
         2. In Phytophthora sick fields, use
only chemical control measures.
Replanting/rejuvenation
Total replanting has to be undertaken in
gardens where the mortality is 50-60 per cent
or above. Where the mortality is below
50 per cent, timely plant protection measures
as described above should be given to all the
existing vines as prophylactic measure and
gaps filled up. Gap filling or replanting should
be taken up only after a period of one year.  At
the time of replanting, soil drenching with copper
oxychloride should be given. While replanting,
farmers should be encouraged to use
recommended varieties.
Fungal pollu (Anthracnose)
For the control of fungal pollu or
anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum gloeo-
sporioides, spray 1 per cent Bordeaux
mixture, once before flowering starts (late June
and early July) and then at berry formation
stage (late August). Minimize shade in the
garden.
Treat the cuttings before planting by
immersing in a solution of carbendazim +
mancozeb (1 g l-1) for 30 minutes and spray
Bordeaux mixture (1%) alternating with
carbendazim (1 g l-1) for effective control of
Colletotrichum infection in nurseries.
Foliar spray of carbendazim @  1g l-1 or a
formulation containing combination of
carbendazim + mancozeb @  1g l-1 during the
month of June can effectively control the
disease.
Wherever Phytophthora foot rot
management is undertaken properly, separate
control measures for pollu disease may not be
necessary.
Note: Since Bordeaux mixture application for
pepper is to be given mostly at a time
when the monsoon is very active, it is to
be ensured that a sticker is added to the
fungicide. The cheapest and most
effective sticker is rosin washing soda
mixture.
Rotting disease
For control of rotting disease of cuttings in
the nursery, VAM and Trichoderma can be
applied in the potting mixture. VAM
inoculum consisting of infected root bits and
soils can be applied @100 cc per kg of
potting mixture and Trichoderma @ 1g kg-1
of potting mixture. For the control of foliar
infection apply potassium phosphonate
@ 3 ml litre-1  at fortnightly interval. In case,
biocontrol agents are not incorporated in the
potting mixture, 1 per cent Bordeaux
mixture spray at weekly interval may be
resorted to. When the cuttings start
germination, ensure good aeration in the
nursery.  Heavy watering, which causes water
stagnation is to be avoided. Instead, light and
frequent watering should be resorted to.
Remove shade as soon as continuous rain
sets in.
Phyllody
In certain pockets, instead of normal spike
with berries, leaf-like structures are
produced.  This is caused by Phytoplasma.
Such vines, if noticed, must be uprooted and
destroyed.  Planting material should not be
collected from such vines.
Stunted disease
The symptoms due to this disease include
shortening of internode and narrowing of leaves
with mottling.  Such leaves also become
leathery and deformed.  This is caused by a
virus.  Since the disease is systemic and
143

transmitted through planting materials, avoid
collecting planting materials from such vines.
Once it is noticed, uproot the vines to avoid
further spread.

Harvesting and processing
Black pepper
Black pepper of commerce is produced
from whole, unripe but fully mature
berries. The harvested berries are piled up in
a heap to initiate browning. Then berries are
detached from the stalk by threshing. Then they
are spread on suitable  drying floor.  During sun-
drying, berries are raked to ensure uniform
drying and to avoid mould development.  Drying
the berries for 3-5 days reduces the moisture
content to 10-12 per cent.The dried berries are
cleaned, graded and packed in double lined
gunny bags.
Blanching the berries in boiling water for
one minute prior to sun drying accelerates
browning process as well as the rate of
drying.  It also gives a uniform lustrous black
colour to the finished product and prevents
mouldiness of berries.
White pepper
White pepper is prepared from ripe
berries or by decorticating black pepper.  Bright
red berries, after harvest are detached from
the stalk and packed in gunny bags.  The bags
are allowed to soak in slow running water for
about one week during which bacterial rotting
occurs and pericarp gets loosened. Then the
berries are trampled under feet to remove any
adhering pericarp, washed in water and then
sun dried to reduce the moisture content to 10-
12 per cent and to achieve a cream or white
colour.  White pepper is garbled, sorted and
packed in gunny bags. Approximately 25 kg
white pepper is obtained from 100 kg ripe berries.

Improved CFTRI method
Fully mature but unripe berries are
harvested and boiled in water for 10-15 minutes
to soften the pericarp. After cooling, the skin
is rubbed off either mechanically or manually,
washed and sun dried to obtain white pepper.
Since no retting operation is involved, the
product will be free from any unpleasant odour.
However, white pepper produced by this
method gives pepper powder of light brown
colour due to gelatinisation of starch in contrast
to pure white powder obtained by traditional
method.
Decorticated black pepper
This is a form of white pepper produced by
mechanical decortication of the outer skin of
black pepper.  This is generally done when
white pepper is in short supply.  The
appearance of decorticated kernel is inferior
to traditionally prepared white pepper, but is
satisfactory when ground.  Also the milling
operation requires considerable skill to avoid
excessive volatile oil loss.
Dehydrated green pepper
In this method, under-mature berries are
harvested and subjected to heat treatment for
inactivating the enzymes responsible for
browning reaction.Then the berries are
dehydrated under controlled conditions wherein
maximum retention of green colour is obtained.
Dehydrated green pepper after reconstitution
in water resembles freshly harvested green
pepper.  The advantage is that the season of
availability can be extended and the berries
could be stored for a year or more. Dry
recovery comes to 20 per cent.
Canned green pepper
Green pepper after harvest is preserved in
two per cent brine solution and the
product is heat sterilized.  This product has the
additional advantage over dehydrated green
pepper in that it retains the natural colour,
texture and flavour.
Bottled green pepper
Green pepper is preserved without
spoilage in 20 per cent brine solution
containing 100 ppm SO2 and 0.2 per cent
citric acid. Addition of citric acid prevents
blackening of berries.
Cured green pepper
To overcome the disadvantages of poor
texture and weak flavour of dehydrated
greenpepper and the high unit weight and
packing cost of canned and bottled green
pepper, cured green pepper has been
developed. Berries are thoroughly cleaned in
water, steeped in saturated brine solution for
2-3 months, drained and packed in suitable
flexible polyethylene pouches.
Freeze-dried green pepper
Most of the moisture from fresh tender
green pepper is removed by freezing the
berries at -30oC to - 40oC under high vacuum.
The colour, aroma and texture of freeze-dried
green pepper are superior to sun dried or
mechanically dehydrated green pepper.
Freeze-dried green pepper has 2 - 4 per cent
moisture and is very light.
Pepper oil
Black pepper is crushed to coarse
powder and steam distilled to obtain 2.5 to 3.5
per cent colourless to pale green essential oil
which becomes viscous on ageing. It is used
in perfumery and in flavouring. The drying
percentage & oil content of KAU Varieties of
Pepper are given as Table 28. Oil can also be
distilled from white pepper but high price of
white pepper and low oil yield do not favour its
commercial production.

TURMERIC (Curcuma longa)
Turmeric is a tropical herb and can be grown
on different types of soil under irrigated and
rainfed conditions. Rich loamy soils having good
drainage are ideal for the crop. It is a shade
tolerant crop with shallow roots suitable for
intercropping and also as a component crop in
the homesteads where low to medium shade
is available.
Preparation of land
Prepare the land to a fine tilth during
February-March. On receipt of pre-monsoon
showers in April, prepare beds of size 3 m x 1.2 m
with a spacing of 40 cm between beds.
Seed material
Whole or split mother rhizomes are used
for planting. Select well developed, healthy and
disease free rhizomes. Treat the rhizomes in
any of the copper oxychloride fungicides and
store in cool, dry place or in earthen pits
plastered with mud and cowdung.

the odour, flavour and pungent principles of the
spice.  The content of the pungent alkaloid
piperine ranges from 4 to 6 per cent in dry
pepper and 35 to 50 per cent in oleoresin.  When
freshly made, pepper oleoresin is a dark green,
viscous, heavy liquid with a strong aroma.
One kg of oleoresin when dispersed on an inert
base can replace 15 to 20 kg of spice for
flavouring purpose.
Varieties
Cultivars: Tekurpetta, Sugantham, Kodur,
Armoor, Alleppey.
Improved varieties: Suvarna, Suguna,
Sudarshana, Prabha, Prathibha, Kanthi, Sobha,
Sona, Varna, IISR Kedaram and IISR
Alleppey Supreme (Resistant to leaf blotch).
Season and method of planting
Plant during April with the receipt of
pre-monsoon showers. Take small pits in the
beds in rows with a spacing of 25cm x 25cm.
Plant finger rhizomes flat with buds facing
upwards and cover with soil or dry powdered
cattle manure. The seed rate is about
2000-2500 kg ha
-1.
Manuring
Apply cattle manure or compost as basal
dose at 40 t ha-1 at the time of land preparation
or by spreading over the beds after planting.
Apply N:P2O5:K2O @ 30:30:60 kg ha-1. Full
BLACK PEPPER AND TURMERIC
146
dose of P2O5 and half dose of K2O may be
applied as basal; 2/3 dose of N may be applied
at 30 days after planting; and 1/3 N and
remaining K2O may be applied 60 days after
planting.
Apply 20 t FYM + 2 t Neem cake + 1 t
Ash + 4 t vermicompost/ha. Also use
Azospirillum and P- Solubilising bacteria (20 g/
bed 3X1 m) as nutrient supplement.
Mulching
Mulch the crop immediately after
planting with green leaves @ 15 t ha-1.
Repeat mulching after 50 days with the same
quantity of green leaves.
After cultivation
Weed the crop thrice at 60, 120 and
150 days after planting, depending upon
weed intensity. Earth up the crop after
60 days.
Intercropping
Chilli, maize and colocasia can be grown
as intercrops.
Harvesting and curing
Time of harvest depends upon variety and
usually extends from January to March.
Harvest early varieties at 7-8 months,
medium varieties at 8-9 months and long
duration varieties at 9-10 months after
planting.
Improved method of processing
Cleaning: Harvested turmeric rhizomes are
cleaned off mud and other extraneous
materials adhering to them and subjected to
curing within 2-3 days after harvest so as to
ensure the quality of the end product.
Boiling: Fingers and mother rhizomes will have
to be boiled separately. Boiling is usually done
in MS pans of suitable size. Cleaned rhizomes
(approximately 50 kg) are taken in a perforated
trough of size 0.9 m x 0.55 m x 0.4 m made of
GI or MS sheet with extended handle. The
trough containing the rhizomes is then
immersed in MS pan (1 m x 0.62 m x 0.48 m)
containing clean water sufficient to immerse
the rhizomes. The whole mass is boiled till the
rhizomes become soft. The correct stage of
cooking can be judged by piercing a wooden
needle through the rhizome. If the rhizomes
are properly cooked, the needle will pass
through the rhizome without resistance. The
cooked rhizomes are taken out of the pan by
lifting the trough and draining the solution into
the pan.
Drying: The fingers are then dried in the sun
by spreading them as a thin layer on
bamboo mats or drying floor. Artificial
drying at a maximum temperature of 60oC
gives a bright coloured product than that of
sun drying especially for sliced turmeric.
Curing of Turmeric: Use turmeric boiler
TNAU model 100 kg capacity especially for
commercial growers and steam boil for 60
minutes. This method reduces drying time to
10 days and improves quality and cleanliness.
Polishing
In order to smoothen the rough and hard
outer surface of the boiled dried turmeric and
also to improve its colour, it is subjected to
polishing. There are two types of polishing: hand
polishing and machine polishing.
Hand polishing: The method of hand
polishing is simple, which consists of
rubbing turmeric fingers on hard surface or
trampling them under feet wrapped in gunny
bags. The improved method is by using
hand-operated barrel or drum mounted on a
central axis, the sides of which are made of

CAMBOGE (KUDAMPULI)
(Garcinia gummi-gutta var. gummi-gutta)
Garcinia, the camboge tree is a big sized
glabrous and evergreen forest tree commonly
seen in the Western Ghats of Kerala,
Karnataka, and also in Sri Lanka. The tree is
very much adapted to hill tops and plain lands
alike. But, its performance is best in river banks
and valleys. It grows well in dry or occasionally
waterlogged or flooded soils.
The economic part of the plant is its
mature fruit, which is highly acidic. The
extract obtained from the mature fruit rind,
(-) hydroxy citric acid, attracts foreign markets,
for its use in medicines controlling obesity.
Varieties
Amrutham, Haritham.
Planting materials
Grafts prepared through soft wood
grafting or side grafting and healthy
seedlings raised in the nursery are used for
cultivation. If seedlings are planted, 50-60 per
cent will be male and female takes 10-12 years
expanded metal mesh. When the drum filled
with turmeric is rotated, polishing is effected
by abrasion of the surface against the mesh as
well as by mutual rubbing against each other
as they roll inside the drum.
Machine polishing: This method consists of
an octagonal or hexagonal wooden drum
mounted on a central axis and rotated by
power.
Turmeric oleoresin
This is obtained by the solvent extraction
of the ground spice with organic solvents like
acetone, ethylene dichloride and ethanol for 4-
5 hours. It is orange red in colour. Oleoresin
yield ranges from 7.9 to 10.4 per cent. One kg
of oleoresin replaces 8 kg of ground spice.
Plant protection
No major incidence of pest or disease is
noticed in the crop. Shoot borers can be
controlled by spraying 0.05 per cent dimethoate
or 0.05 per cent quinalphos.
Leaf spot and leaf blotch can be
controlled by spraying 1 per cent Bordeaux
mixture or 0.2 per cent mancozeb. If
symptoms of early wilt or rhizome rot appear,
drench the soil with cheshunt compound or
1 per cent Bordeaux mixture.
for bearing. Hence planting of grafts
is advocated as they ensure maternal
characters including early bearing tendency.
Propagation by seedlings
Selection of mother trees: Locate mother
trees that give a steady annual yield with a
mean fruit weight of 200-275 g, high acid and
low tannin content. Collect seeds from freshly
harvested and fully ripe fruits and wash in
running water and spread in a thin layer   under
roof. By the 20
th day, seeds will be ready for
sowing. Sow seeds at the rate of two per bag
in polybags during the month of August-
September. Usually seeds start sprouting in the
month of December but the sprouts become
visible above the soil surface only by February.
In order to avoid delayed germination, simple
seed treatment methods can be employed.
Method 1: In this method, the processed
seeds (after drying under shade) are given a
mechanical treatment. Remove seed coats of
TURMERIC AND CAMBOGE
148
such seeds using a sharp knife without
injuring the ivory coloured cotyledon. Sow these
ivory coloured cotyledons afresh in polybags
at a depth of 3 cm. Germination starts in 20-25
days after sowing.
Method 2: After removing the seed coats,
treat the seeds with gibberellic acid @ 250 ppm
for 6 hours and thereafter soak them in
mancozeb @ 4 g per l  for 2 hours. Sow the
seeds in nursery bags and irrigate daily. Seeds
germinate in 16-20 days.
Method 3: Second method followed by
transfer of the seeds to a white polypropylene
cover of size 20 cm x 25 cm along with 30-50
ml of filtered water. Tie the polybag along with
the air inside tightly using a rubber band. Such
seeds germinate in 10-12 days after sowing.
In a polybag, about 500-750 seeds can be
incubated at a time. Pick up the sprouted seeds
and sow in the nursery bags kept under shade.
Keep the seedlings under shade. Irrigate
them regularly on alternate days during
summer months. After 3-4 months, place the
seedlings under direct sunlight to trigger
robust growth. At this age, apply FYM @
50 g per bag. In six to seven months time,
seedlings will be ready for planting.
Propagation by grafting
Two types of grafting methods are
employed viz. soft wood grafting and
approach grafting.
Soft wood grafting
Select scions only from specific elite trees
regular in bearing, which produce high yield of
large and quality fruits.
Collection of scion: Select straight growing,
healthy, young shoots emerging from the
primary branches with whorled leaf
arrangement. Cut them to a length of 6-10 cm
and store in polybags under humid condition.
Remove leaves partly and shape the cut end
to a wedge of  3-4 cm length by giving slanting
cuts on two opposite sides.
Preparation of rootstock: Stock-plants having
3-4 mm stem thickness are ideal for grafting.
Behead the selected plants at two nodes below
the terminal bud and remove all the leaves at
the graft union. Use scion and rootstock of
same thickness for grafting. Grafting: Insert
the wedge of the scion into the cleft made on
the rootstock and secure the graft joint firmly
with a black polythene tape, 1.5-2 cm wide
and 30 cm long.
Care in the nursery: Immediately after
grafting, cover the plants with a transparent
polypropylene cover and keep under shade. By
the 30th day, grafts will establish and new
leaves will start emerging. Remove the
polythene cover and keep under shade. Water
the grafts daily using rose-can or micro-
sprinkler. Care should be taken to remove
sprouts emerging from rootstock at frequent
intervals. Three months after grafting the plants
will be ready for planting in the main field. Just
before planting in the main field, leave the
grafts under open condition in 10-15 days for
hardening.
Approach grafting
Here also stock plants having 3-4 mm
thickness are preferred and they are brought
to the place where the mother tree is located.
Grafting is done as in other crops and is kept
intact for 45 days by which time union
occurs. Graft is detached from the mother tree
in three steps. The main disadvantage is that
only a limited number of grafts can be produced
in this method. Forty five days after grafting,
they will be ready for transferring to the main
nursery for hardening. Grafts are to be watered
daily using a rose-can or micro-sprinkler. Care
should be taken to remove sprouts emerging
from rootstock at frequent intervals. Leaf
folding pests common in the nursery can be
controlled by spraying with quinalphos @ 2 ml

CAMBOGE
l -1 at monthly intervals. One year old grafts
can be used for field planting.
Planting
The plants can be raised as a pure crop or as
a mixed crop in coconut and arecanut
gardens. Take pits of size 0.75 m x 0.75 m x 0.75 m
in hard and laterite soils; 0.50 m x
0.50 m x 0.50 m in sandy and alluvial soils, at a
spacing of 4 m x 4 m for grafts and 7 m x
7 m for seedlings. In slopes of 15 per cent or
more, for planting grafts, rows are spaced at 5
to 5.5 m and 3.5 m between trees in a row.
For planting seedlings, rows are spaced at 8 to
12 m and at 6 to 8 m for trees in a row. Planting
is generally done at the onset of monsoon
showers. Under existing coconut plantation of
25 years and above, spacing shall be so
adjusted that it should alternate with the palms
in the rows. Under Kuttanad conditions, where
bunds and channels alternate, planting can be
done in between two palms. Fill the pits with
topsoil and 5 kg of compost or well-
decomposed cattle manure and 10 g of carbaryl
10 per cent dust, to avoid white ant attack,
before planting. The graft union shall remain
just above the ground level. Provide support to
the young plants. One month after planting,
gently remove the polythene tape around the
graft union.
Management of plantation
Clean the field free of bushes and thick
shades. Weed once in three months and mulch
the basin with black polythene or dry leaves to
avoid drying.
Manuring
Apply 10 kg cattle manure or compost per
seedling / graft during the first year. Gradually
increase the quantity so that a well-grown tree
of 15 years and above receives 50 kg of
organic manure per year. Apply N:P2O5:K2O
mixture at the rate of 20:18:50 g/plant during
the first year. Double the dose in the second
year and gradually increase it to 500:250:1000 g /
plant / year at the 15th year.
Pruning
Grafts will grow fast from the second year
onwards. Give strong support with casuarina
poles at this stage. By fifth year, the tree will
have 3 to 4 m height. At this stage, height of
the plant may be maintained at 3.5 to 4 m and
by seventh year at 4 to 4.5 m by pruning.
Pests and diseases
Hard scales and beetles are found to
infest the crop. Hard scales desap the leaves
and tender shoots. Both the adult beetles and
their grubs defoliate the crop inflicting heavy
loss of yield. Control these pests by spraying
dimethoate @ 1 ml l
-1. Leaf folders are very
common in the nursery against which
quinalphos @ 2 ml l
-1 may be sprayed.
Incidence of hoppers is observed on grafts and
large trees. This causes withering of leaves,
drying up of branches and yield loss. Control
them by spraying  dichlorovos 1 ml per litre of
water. Sooty mould is seen associated with
hard scales. Seedling blight in the nursery stage
is very common. Control it by drenching
nursery bed with 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture
or using mancozeb @ 5 g l-1. In grafts and
large trees, sometimes, fungal thread blights
have been observed to cause leaf and twig
blight. Adopt proper pruning and spray
1per cent Bordeaux mixture or mancozeb
0.3 per cent.
Harvesting
Seedlings start bearing generally at the age
of 10-12 years. Grafts start bearing from the
third year onwards and will attain full
CAMBOGE
150
bearing at the age of 12 to 15 years.
Flowering occurs in January-March and fruits
mature in July. There are reports of off-season
bearers, which bear two times a year, i.e.,
during January-July and September-February.
Mature fruits, which are orange yellow in
colour, drop off from the tree. Harvest mature
fruits manually before they fall. Immediately
after harvest, wash the fruits in running water
and separate the fruit rind for processing.
Processing
Separated fruit rind is first sun dried and
then either smoke-dried or oven-dried at
70-80ºC. In order to increase the storage life
and to impart softness, mix the dried rind
with common salt @ 150 g and coconut oil @
50 ml per kg of dried rind.
Garcinia powder:  Drying of Garcinia
cambogia juice into powdered particles gives
a considerable reduction in volume, easy to
use and is an effective method for prolonging
the shelf life. Powder from fresh fruit juice
along with standardized limit of additive,
followed by spray drying could get powder
which packed in Aluminium pouches gives a
storability of above 7 months with good
reconstitution properties.
Optimized parameters of production are
spray drying at inlet air temperature of 180oC
with  the atomizer speed of 22000 rpm and
feed rate as 5.5 l/h. The powder is packed in
LDPE inserted in aluminium foil pouches and
can be stored for 7 months with good
reconstitution properties (wetting time, 80 S
and solubility index <0.1mm )
TAMARIND (Tamarindus indica)
The tree is particularly well adapted to semi-
arid tropical regions, but can be grown in heavy
rainfall areas too, provided the soil is well
drained. It is adaptable to poor soil also.
Propagation technique
It is propagated by means of seeds, grafts
and budding. Healthy seeds are sown in
polybags and seedlings are transplanted at 40-
60 cm height. Due to erratic bearing of seedling
progeny, grafts are successfully used as
propagules. Side grafting, inarching and patch
budding are commonly practised. Budding is
done on nine month old saplings for higher
success.
Cultural operations
Plants of 40-60 cm height are planted during
June to November at 10 m x 10 m spacing in
pits of 1 m3 size incorporated with 15 kg of
FYM. Regular watering till the plants establish
in the field is a must. Leader shoot is cut at 3
m above ground level to induce scaffold
branches. Organic manures are generally
used. Intercropping with vegetables, groundnut
and sesame can be done till the fifth year.
Pests and diseases
Insects like Tribolium castaneum and
fungi are serious problems in storage and
field respectively. Spray application of
Quinalphos 0.05 per cent at the time of
fruiting, when infestation starts, can control
the storage beetle.
Harvest and yield
Seedlings start to yield 8-10 years after
planting, whereas grafts and budded
seedlings give yield after 4-5 years. Stabilized
yield of 250 kg/tree is obtained from
9-10 years onwards. Harvesting is done from
January to April. There is also a tendency of
alternate bearing as in the case of mango.

CAMBOGE AND TAMARIND
BEVERAGES AND STIMULANTS
ARECANUT (Areca catechu)
The arecanut palms grow under a variety
of climatic and soil conditions. It grows well
from almost sea level up to an altitude of 1000 m
in areas of abundant and well-distributed
rainfall or under irrigated conditions. It is
grown in a variety of soils such as laterites,
red loams and alluvial.
Varieties
Mangala, Sumangala, Sreemangala and
Mohitnagar, VTLAH1, VTLAH2
Selection of site
Select sites with deep well drained soil
without high water table. Provide adequate
irrigation facilities.
Selection of mother palms
Select mother palms showing earliness and
regularity in bearing, high percentage of fruit
set and dwarf to semi-tall stature.
Selection of seed nuts
Select fully tree-ripe nuts from middle
bunches during mid season. Discard nuts, which
are undersized, malformed and low in weight.
Nursery techniques
Sow selected seed nuts soon after
harvest in nursery bed with stalk-end up and
with a spacing of 5-6 cm. Cover the seed nuts
with sand and irrigate daily.
Transplant 90 days old sprouts having
2-3 leaves to the secondary nursery. Prepare
secondary nursery beds of 150 cm width
and convenient length. Apply cattle manure @
5 t ha-1 as basal dose. Transplant sprouts at a
spacing of 30 cm x 30 cm. Provide shade by
growing banana, Coccinia indica etc. or by
means of artificial pandal. Plant banana in
advance at a spacing of 2.7 m x 3.6 m when it
is grown as a shade crop. Provide irrigation
during hot and dry periods and drainage during
monsoon. Periodical weeding and mulching are
necessary.
Selection of seedlings
Select good seedlings for transplanting in
the main field when they are 12-18 months old.
Selection of seedlings can be based on the
selection index.
Note: Plant characters such as girth at the
collar one year after transplanting and
number of nodes two years after
transplanting are highly correlated with
yield. Removal of plants with poor collar
girth and lesser number of nodes one
and two years after planting respectively,
will help to increase the yield potential
of plantations.
Field planting
Plant tall, quick growing shade trees
on the southern and western sides of the
plantation to provide protection from sun
scorching.
Plant seedlings in pits at a spacing of
2.7 m x 2.7 m with north-south alignment, the
rows being deflected at an angle of 35º
towards west. Dig pits of size 60 cm x 60 cm x
60 cm and fill up with rich topsoil to a level of
15 cm from the bottom. Plant seedlings at the
centre of pit, cover with soil up to collar level
and press around.
The planting is to be done during
May-June in well-drained soils and during
August-September in clayey soils. Banana may
be planted between rows to provide shade in
the initial stages up to 4-5 years.
Manuring
Apply green leaf and compost, each
ARECANUT
152
@12 kg per palm per year from first year of
planting onwards, during September-October.
Apply N:P2O5:K2O for adult palms
@ 100: 40:140 g / palm / year.
Apply 1/3 dose during first year, 2/3 dose
during second year and full dose from third
year onwards. Under irrigated conditions, apply
fertilizers in two split doses, the first during
September-October and the second during
February. Under rainfed conditions, apply the
second dose during March-April after the
receipt of summer rains. Apply manures and
fertilizers during September-October in circular
basins of 15-20 cm depth and with a radius of
0.75-1.0 m from the palm. Apply the second
dose of fertilizers around the base of palm after
weeding and mix into soil by light forking. In
acidic soils, broadcast lime @ 0.5 kg per palm
once in two or three years and incorporate into
soil by forking during March-April.
Irrigation and drainage
Irrigate the palms during hot and dry
periods at regular intervals depending upon the
soil type.
The palms should be irrigated once in four
to seven days depending on the soil type and
climatic factors. In west coast, where major
area of arecanut gardens are irrigated,
watering the garden once in seven or eight days
during November-December, once in six days
during January-February and once in three to
five days during March-April-May is
recommended. In each irrigation, give about
175 litres of water per palm. Where there is
shortage of water, follow drip irrigation.
Application of organic mulch to the garden
helps conservation of soil moisture.
Construct drainage channels (25-30 cm
deep from the bottom of pits) between the rows
and drain out water during periods of heavy
rainfall to prevent waterlogging.
Cultural operations
Keep the garden free of weeds and break
up surface crust by light forking or digging after
cessation of monsoon during October-
November. In slopes, prevent soil erosion by
terracing. Sow seeds of green manure-cum-
cover crops such as Mimosa invisa,
Stylosanthes gracilis and Calapagonium
muconoides in April-May with the onset of
pre-monsoon rains. Cut and apply them to the
palms in September-October.
Intercropping and mixed cropping
Crops such as elephant foot yam,
pineapple, pepper, betel vine, banana, guinea
grass, cocoa, ginger and cardamom can
be grown in arecanut gardens. While
planting cocoa, a spacing 2.7 m x 5.4 m is
recommended. In all cases, the intercrops
should be manured adequately and separately.
Plant protection
Pests
Mites
Orange coloured mites can be controlled
by spraying the bunches with dimethoate at
0.05 per cent.
Inflorescence caterpillar (Batachedra sp.)
Force open the inflorescence out of the
enclosing spathe and spray malathion 50 EC
(250 ml in 100 litres of water). Control slugs,
which predispose inflorescence to the attack
of caterpillar, by using bait of metaldehyde.
Root grub (Leucopholis burmeisteri)
Loosen soil around the base of palms to a
depth of 10-15 cm and drench with chlorpyrifos
0.04 per cent suspension twice, one in May
just before the onset of southwest monsoon
and again in September-October towards the
end of the monsoon. Repeat application for 2
or 3 years consecutively to secure a complete
eradication of the pest.
153
ARECANUT
Diseases
Koleroga (Mahali or fruit rot)
(Phytophthora palmivora)
Spray Bordeaux mixture 1 per cent on all
bunches three times in a year, one just
before the onset of southwest monsoon and
the rest at 40 days intervals. If monsoon
season is prolonged give a third spray. Use rosin
soda adhesive to ensure tenacity of the spray
deposit on treated substrate. Remove and burn
all fallen and infected nuts.
Bud rot (Phytophthora palmivora)
Remove and destroy affected spindle and
leaves. In early stages of infection, scoop out
affected rotten tissues by making longitudinal
side splits and apply Bordeaux paste on the
exposed healthy tissues or drench crown with
1 per cent Bordeaux mixture.
Basal stem rot (Anabe) (Ganoderma
lucidum)
1. Isolate affected palms by digging trenches
60 cm deep and 30 cm wide around, one
metre away from the base and drench with
calixin (0.08 per cent) or copper
oxychloride (0.3 per cent).
2. Remove and destroy all severely affected
palms and stumps of dead palms.
3. Drench the soil with 1 per cent Bordeaux
mixture before planting healthy seedlings.
4. Discourage growing of collateral hosts of
fungus such as Delonix regia and
Pongamia glabra in the vicinity of
gardens.
5. Apply 2 kg neem cake per palm.
6. Avoid flood irrigation and water flowing
from infected palms to healthy palms.
Yellow leaf disease
Together with the routine pest and disease
control measures different management
strategies may be adopted to control yellowing
of arecanut grown in the following topo
sequences:
1. Converted paddy fields
• Provide deep drainage channels so as to
keep the water below the root zone during
monsoon.
• 150 g lime palm-1  year-1  may be applied in
the basin opened during February.
• A minimum of 10 kg palm-1 organic manure
as farmyard manure/compost may be
provided.
• Fertilizer application may be done @
100:40:200g NPK palm-1year-1 in two splits
in February and September under irrigated
conditions. A sulphur containing fertilizer
either single super phosphate or
ammonium sulphate or ammonium
phosphate sulphate (Factamphos) should
be used in the fertilizer schedule so as to
include a minimum of 100g S palm-1 year-1.
• Magnesium sulphate @ 60 g, borax and
zinc sulphate @ 20 g palm-1  year should
be included to yellowing affected palms.
2. Garden land
• 150 g lime and a minimum of 10 kg organic
manure, 60 g magnesium sulphate per
palm per year may be applied as in case
of converted paddy field.
• Fertilizer @ 100:40:250g NPK palm-1 year-1
in two splits in February and September
by way of including any sulphur containing
fertilizer so as to supply a minimum of
100 g S palm-1 year-1, under irrigated
conditions, can be adopted.
3. Terraced upland
• 150 g lime and a minimum of 15 kg organic
manure palm-1 year-1 may be applied as in
case of garden land.
ARECANUT
154
• Fertilizer @ 100:40:250g NPK in two splits
in February and September, including any
sulphur containing fertilizer source so as
to supply a minimum of 100 g S/palm/year,
60 g magnesium sulphate and 20 g borax
and 20 g zinc sulphate/palm/year under
irrigated conditions can be adopted.
Band disease
Improve soil conditions by loosening hard
soil strata, if present, by providing good
drainage. Adopt adequate control measures
against spindle bug, mealy bugs, scales and
mites. Where the results of the above
treatments are not found satisfactory, apply
powdered mixture of copper sulphate and lime
in equal quantities @ 225 g/palm twice a year
at the base of affected palms. Application of
borax @ 25 g/palm has been found to have an
ameliorative effect.
Collar rot of seedlings
Improve drainage conditions in nursery
beds and gardens. Drench spindle and base
of seedlings with 1 per cent Bordeaux
mixture in disease affected nursery or garden.
Dieback of inflorescence
Remove affected inflorescence imme
diately. Spray  mancozeb (3 g l-1) twice, one
just after female flowers are set and again
15-28 days later. Aureofungin sol at 100 ppm
concentration is also effective in controlling the
disease.
Stem bleeding
Palms in the age group of 10-15 years are
more prone to this disease. Symptoms
appear on the basal portion of the stem as small
discoloured depression. Later, these spots
coalesce and cracks develop on the stem
leading to disintegration of the fibrous tissues
inside. With the progress of the disease, a
brown exudate oozes out from these cracks.
High water table predisposes the palm to this
disease.
Improvement of drainage and root
feeding of 125 ml tridemorph (1.5 per cent) is
suggested as control measure against this
disease.
Sun scorch
Protect palms from southwest sun by
wrapping stems with areca sheath or
white-wash the exposed portion. Provide
reinforcement to palms showing stem
fissures. Grow tall, quick growing trees on
southern and western sides of garden.
Nut splitting
This can be considered as a physiological
disorder than a disease. Palms in the age group
of 10-25 years are more susceptible. Symptoms
are premature yellowing of the nuts when they
are half to three-fourth mature. Later splits
develop at the tips, which extend longitudinally
exposing the kernel. Sometimes kernel also
show splitting and malformation. Rarely the
kernel inside may exhibit splitting without visual
symptoms on the husk,  resulting in nut fall.
Hyper nutrition or sudden flush of water after
a period of drought or insufficient moisture in
the soil is the probable cause (s) of the disease.
Improvement of drainage in ill drained
gardens and spraying of borax @ 2 g l-1 of
water are found effective in reducing the
disease incidence.
De-husking
A simple de-husking device has been
standardized by the CPCRI, Kasaragod. The
out turn with this device is 60 kg of husked
nuts in the case of dry nuts and 30 kg in the
case of green nuts.The cost of the device is
about Rs. 250/-
155
ARECANUT
Betel vine requires a tropical climate with
high atmospheric humidity. It can be
cultivated in the uplands as well as in
wetlands. In Kerala, it is mainly cultivated in
arecanut and coconut gardens as an intercrop.
The crop grows best on well-drained fertile
soils. Waterlogged, saline and alkali soils are
unsuitable for its cultivation. The crop also
comes up very well in lateritic soils. Proper
shade and irrigation are essential for successful
cultivation of this crop. An annual rainfall
ranging from 200 to 450 cm is ideal. The crop
tolerates a minimum temperature of 10oC
and a maximum of 40oC. Extremely low
atmospheric temperature leads to leaf fall. Hot
dry winds are harmful.
Varieties
The important types are Thulasi, Venmani,
Arikodi, Kalkodi, Karilanchi, Karpuram,
Chelanthikarpuram, Koottakkodinandan,
Perumkodi, Amaravila and Pramuttan.
Season
There are two important planting seasons.
The Edavakodi is planted in May-June and the
Thulakodi in August-September.
Preparation of land
Areas with good shade and irrigation
facilities are preferred for this crop. The land
is dug well and laid out into furrows of
10-15 m length, 75 cm width and 75 cm depth.
Such furrows are opened at a distance of 1 m
apart. Well rotten farmyard manure and leaves
are thoroughly incorporated with the topsoil of
the furrows, along with wood ash. High dose of
organic manure (20-50 t ha-1) is applied to
maintain good soil structure, which is essential
for the proper development of the root system.
Planting material and planting
Top portions of mature vines (2-3 years old)
are used for planting. Healthy cuttings of about
1 m length with three nodes are used as planting
material. For planting one hectare, 20000-
25000 cuttings are required. Furrows are
irrigated prior to planting. Cuttings are planted
in holes 20 cm apart in furrows. While planting,
one node shall be buried in the soil and the
second node should be at the ground level. The
soil around the planted cutting must be pressed
firmly to encourage quick germination. It is
necessary to provide shade to the planted
cuttings. Coconut leaves are used as shading
material. To prevent excess moisture in the soil,
splashing water on the vines by hand is
preferable in the early stages. In the absence
of rain, light irrigation, four times daily, is given
till establishment. Cuttings establish in three
weeks time and the first leaf emerges in about
a month.
Irrigation and drainage
Betel vine needs constantly moist soil, but
there should not be excessive moisture. Hence,
frequent light irrigations are given. The quantity
of irrigation water should be such that the
standing water should not remain for more than
half an hour in the bed. If waterlogging by
heavy rains or excess irrigation occurs,
drainage should be arranged immediately. The
best time for irrigation is morning or evening.
Trailing the vines and weeding
The cuttings sprout and creep in about a
month. At this time, they must be trailed on the
BETEL VINE (Piper betle)
BETEL VINE
156
standards. Bamboo standards are erected at
intervals and linked by tying at heights of
30 cm and 150 cm using coir rope. In the initial
stages trailing is done on coir tied for the
purpose. Trailing is done further by tying the
vines, at intervals of 15-20 cm along the
standards loosely with the help of banana fibre.
When vines come in contact with standards,
they produce adventitious roots using which
they cling to support. Trailing is done every
15-20 days depending on the growth of vines.
Gardens should be kept clean by weeding and
stirring as and when required.
Manuring
Dried leaves and wood ash are applied to
the furrows at fortnightly intervals and cowdung
slurry is sprinkled. This is repeated till four
months after planting when the crop is ready
for harvest. Application of different kinds of
leaves (gliricidia, mango leaves etc.) at monthly
intervals is found advantageous for the growth
of the vines.
Harvesting
In about 3-6 months time, vines grow to a
height 150-180 cm. At this stage branching is
noticed in the vines. Leaves are removed along
with the petiole with the right thumb. Once
harvesting is commenced, it is continued almost
every day or week. The interval of harvesting
varies from 15 days to about a month till the
next lowering of vines. After each harvest,
manuring has to be done.
Lowering the vines
Under normal conditions, vines grow to a
height of about 3 m in one year time. When
they reach this height, their vigour to
produce normal sized leaves is reduced and
the crop needs rejuvenation. This is done by
lowering the vines down to the ground level at
least once a year. Lowering is done
during the months of August-September.
Before lowering, all the leaves in the basal
portion of the vines to a height of 15 cm are
removed. Vine is untied from bottom
upwards and coiled up carefully and laid flat
on ground leaving 2.5 to 5 cm length of top
shoots. Soil is put over the portion kept in the
soil to about 5 cm thickness. Lowering is
followed by light irrigation and manuring.
Plant protection
The insect pests include the mirid
bug (Disphincuts politus) which desaps
the tender leaves and shoots, scale insects
and mealy bugs (Lepidosaphes and
Pseudococcus), which occur on the stems.
Insecticidal application is not recommended to
avoid toxic hazards. In serious infestations,
apply fish oil soap at 1.5 per cent against the
mirid bugs and 0.05 per cent quinalphos against
the scale insects and mealy bugs. Against
scale insects, restrict insecticide application on
the stem only. The leaves should be
harvested only after 15 days of insecticide
application. The treated leaves should be
consumed/marketed after thorough washing in
water.  Among the diseases, the bacterial leaf
spot caused by Xanthomonas betlicola is
most serious in southern Kerala.The initial
symptoms appear as small watersoaked
regions, which enlarge and turn dark brown in
the centre with yellow halo. Profuse
bacterial ooze may be seen on the lower
side of the lesion. In severe cases, defoliation
and stem injury occur, leading to wilting
of the plant. The cultivars Karilanchi,
Karpuram and Thulasi are found susce-
ptible to the disease. Spraying 1 per cent
Bordeaux mixture is recommended
to control the disease.
157
BETEL VINE
COCOA (Theobroma cacao)
The cocoa tree flourishes in the dense
shade of warm rain forests in its natural
habitat and hence can be cultivated in all
similar climatic conditions. The tree cannot
withstand high winds, drought or sudden fall in
temperature. The crop requires well-
distributed rainfall. The minimum requirement
of rainfall is about 100-150cm per annum.
Situations where the temperature falls below
10°C or rises above 38°C are unfavourable
although minor deviations from the above limit
can be adjusted by shade and irrigation. High
wind velocity causes considerable mechanical
damage to trees.
Cocoa is grown at altitude up to 900 m
above MSL though it is possible to grow the
crop even in much higher elevations under
sheltered conditions.
The best soil for cocoa is forest soil rich
in humus. The soil should allow easy
penetration of roots and capable of retaining
moisture during summer. Clay loams, loams and
sandy loams are suitable. Shallow soils should
be avoided.
Varieties
Though three varietal types viz., Criollo,
Forastero and Trinitario are recognized,
only Forastero types are known to perform
well under Indian conditions. Breeding
work initiated at the Kerala Agricultural
University since 1979 has resulted in the
release of seven improved clones of Forastero
type. These are CCRP 1, CCRP 2, CCRP 3,
CCRP 4, CCRP 5, CCRP 6 and CCRP 7.
These improved clones are suitable for
cultivation in different cocoa growing tracts of
the country and also in the warm tropical areas
especially under the shade of coconut. All these
clones are tolerant to vascular streak dieback
and have yield potential in the range from 55
to 180 pods per tree per year and mean yield
from 38 to 78 pods per tree per year.
Hybrids : CCRP 8, CCRP 9, CCRP 10,
CCRP 11, CCRP 12, CCRP 13, CCRP 14 and
CCRP 15. These hybrids have mean yields of
90, 105, 79,114,138, 99, 120 and 86 pods per
tree per year respectively. These are also
tolerant/ moderately resistant to vascular streak
dieback disease.
Cocoa exhibits self incompatibility and is
highly cross pollinated. Therefore growing of
different varieties adjacent to each other must
be encouraged so as to achieve maximum fruit
set and yield realization.
Selection of site
Cocoa is usually planted under coconut and
arecanut plantations in India. Shade
levels under coconut canopy are highly
variable depending mainly on the spacing of
coconut, extent of canopy development and age
of palms. It is estimated that light  infiltration
through coconut canopy ranges from about 30
to 80 per cent depending upon these factors.
Based on this, the general recommendation is
as follows:
1. If a choice is possible, a coconut plantation
that will let in about 50 per cent light through
the canopy may be chosen for raising cocoa.
2. If the light infiltration is over 50 per cent, it
may be beneficial to provide additional
shade using temporary shade plants like
banana.
Preparation of land
The seedlings / budded clones are usually
planted in the interspaces of coconut/arecanut.
COCOA
158
Give a spacing of 3 to 4.5 m. The crop is best
grown with 50 per cent light intensity in the
early stages. In the early life of the plants,
planting of quick growing plants like banana
and tapioca can provide temporary shade.
Planting materials
Cocoa can be propagated by seed and
vegetative means.
Seed propagation
It is desirable to collect seeds from biclonal
or polyclonal seed gardens involving superior
self-incompatible parents to ensure genetic
superiority of planting materials. Polyclonal and
biclonal seed gardens have been established
at CCRP farm of the Kerala Agricultural
University, Vellanikkara and Kidu farm of
CPCRI and seeds and seedlings are being
supplied to growers. If seeds cannot be
procured from such seed gardens, mother plants
for collection of seeds may be selected based
on the following criteria:
1. Trees of Forastero type having medium or
large pods of not less than 350 g weight or
400 cc volume, green in colour when
immature, having smooth or shallow
furrows on the surface without prominent
constriction at the neck should be
selected. Yield of pods should be not less
than 100 per year.
2. Husk thickness of pods to be not more than
1 cm.
3. Pod value (number of pods to give 1 kg
wet beans) to be not more than 12.
4. Number of beans per pod to be not less
than 35.
5. Bean dry weight to be not less than 1 g.
Seeds lose viability within a week of
harvest of pods. Seeds are to be sown
immediately after extraction from the pods.
Viability of the beans can be extended for some
more days if freshly extracted seeds are stored
in moist charcoal and packed in polybags.
Other alternative is extracting beans, removing
the testa and packing in polythene bags.
Time of sowing
Though the seeds will germinate at any time
of the year, seeds may preferably be sown by
December-January, so that 4-6 month old
seedlings become available for planting by
May-June.
Method of sowing
Seeds are to be sown with hilum-end down
or to be sown flat. Sowing is to be as shallow
as to just cover the seeds with soil. Removal
of pulp may enhance the speed of germination,
but the extent of additional advantage is only
marginal. Seeds  germinating in about a week
and germination may continue for another
week. Percentage of germination may be
around 90.
Cocoa nursery is to be located in a heavily
shaded area, which allows only 25-50 per cent
sunlight. Regular watering is necessary to keep
the soil moist.
Seedlings are transplanted after 4-6 months.
Only vigorous seedlings are to be used  and
based  on  height  and  stem  girth, 25 per cent
poor seedlings may be rejected. When
seedlings are grown under heavy shade,
hardening for 10 days by exposing to higher
illumination may be necessary before
transplanting.
Vegetative propagation
In view of the high variability exhibited by
seedling progenies, vegetative propagation is
preferred for large scale planting. Though
vegetative propagation of cocoa by budding,
159

rooting of cuttings and grafting are feasible,
the widely accepted method in India is budding.
Scions for budding are to be collected from
high yielding, disease resistant elite plants.
Shoots having brown bark and just hardened
leaves are selected as bud wood. Scions are
preferably pre-cured by cutting off lamina of
all the leaves of the selected scion shoot to a
distance of about 30 cm from the tip. After
10 days when the petioles have fallen off,
these scion shoots are cut and used for budding
immediately. Bud wood can be stored by
dipping in benzyl chloride followed by washing
in water and then sealing the cut ends using
molten wax. Bud wood is then wrapped in moist
cotton wool and in turn in wet tissue paper or
blotting paper and packed in boxes with wet
packing material. The packet is then covered
using polythene sheets. Storage life of the bud
wood can be extended up to 10 days by this
method. As far as possible, bud wood is to be
collected from chupons as those produced from
fans may develop into bushy plants with
spreading habit. Rootstock, six to twelve
months old may be selected in such a way that
scion and rootstock are of the same thickness.
Different successful methods include T,
inverted T, patch and modified Forkert
methods. Patch budding is adopted in the
Kerala Agricultural University.
Patch budding method consists of remov-
ing a patch of about 2.5 cm length and
0.5 cm width from the rootstocks, preparing a
bud patch of 2.5 cm length and 0.5 cm width
from the bud wood and inserting it into the
rootstock and tying firmly with polythene
tape. After three weeks, if there is bud-take,
polythene tape is removed; a vertical cut
is made half way through the stem above the
bud and is snapped back. The snapped
root stock portion is cut back after the bud has
grown to a shoot and at least two leaves have
hardened. It is then allowed to grow for a
further period of three to six months after
which they are transplanted. Under normal
conditions, success can be around 70-90 per
cent.
Selection of planting materials
When seedlings are used for planting,
select only vigorous and healthy seedlings
produced from polyclonal seed garden or
selected mother plants as described earlier.
When budded plants are used, select two or
more clones for planting as the use of a single
clone can lead to poor production due to the
existence of self-incompatibility in cocoa.
Time and method of planting
Raising cocoa as a pure crop is not
recommended especially in Kerala due to high
pressure on land. Cocoa is planted as an
intercrop in coconut and arecanut gardens. In
coconut, depending upon the spacing adopted,
one or two rows of cocoa can be planted in
between two rows of coconut i.e., two
rows where the spacing is more than 8 m and
one row otherwise, the plant distance for cocoa
being 2.7 to 3 m. When two-row system is
adopted, the seedlings may be planted in zigzag
or triangular manner.
In arecanut where the normal spacing is
2.7 m, cocoa is planted at the centre of four
areca palms along alternate rows of inter-
spaces only. Pits of 50 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm
are dug, allowed to weather for one month and
refilled with topsoil and 15-20 kg of
compost or FYM to ground level. The
planting hole should be sufficient to hold the
soil ball of the polybag. Tear off the polybags
carefully, place the soil ball with the
seedlings in the planting hole with minimum
disturbance and press the soil around firmly.
Planting should coincide with the onset of
monsoon, but in places where irrigation is
resorted to, flexibility in the time of planting is
possible.

Shaping of clonal plants derived from fan
shoots
Budded plants from fan shoots have
diffuse branching system and bushy growth
habit. This type of growth causes difficulties
in carrying out cultural operations and
harvesting. If a better shape of the plant is
desired, appropriate formation pruning may be
necessary. This involves identification of a
chupon arising from a fan shoot, allowing it to
grow and removing the original, lower
fan-like shoots in stages. This, however, has
to be done slowly as an early drastic pruning
will inhibit growth.
Manuring
Apply N:P2O5:K2O in two equal split doses
in April-May and September-October, @
100:40: 140 g / tree / year. N:P2O5:K2O may
be applied @ 200:80:280 g / plant / year, in
trees yielding more than 60 fruits per year.
Dolomite @ 100 g / plant / year may be
applied to plants from the third year onwards.
Under irrigated conditions, the yearly dose
may be split into four and applied
during April-May, September-October,
December and February-March.
Apply 1/3 of adult dose during the first year
of planting, 2/3 during second year and full dose
from the third year onwards.
Apply fertilizers in circular basins with
a radius of 25 cm during the first year.
Gradually increase the radius of the basin to
120 cm by the third year. Apply fertilizers in
the entire area of 1.5 m radius around the tree
followed by forking in.
Plants showing zinc deficiency symptoms
(narrowing of leaves, sickle leaf formation,
green vein banding, chlorosis in the interveinal
areas) should be sprayed with 0.5 to 1.5 per
cent  ZnSO4 three times a year.
After cultivation
During the first three or four years after
planting, it is essential to keep the field free
from weeds. Maintenance and regulation of
shade should be carried out promptly.
During the establishment phase of the crop
particularly in summer, provide mulching with
materials like chopped banana sheath,
coconut husk, cocoa husk etc. to conserve
moisture in conditions of direct insolation. A
mature cocoa plantation should form a proper
canopy, which will be dense enough to
prevent weed growth. Operations such as
pruning and regulation of shade should be
attended to in time.
Pruning and training
Cocoa grows in a series of storeys, the
chupon or vertical growth of the seedling
terminating at the jorquette from where four
to five fan branches develop. Further vertical
growth is continued through a side chupon that
arises from a point just below the jorquette
which again jorquettes after growing to some
height. Left for it, the plant will grow to a height
of 8-10 m repeating this process of jorquetting
and chupon formation 3-5 times.
When cocoa is grown as an intercrop in
coconut and arecanut  plantation, it is desirable
to restrict the growth to one tier formed at a
convenient height preferably above the head
level of the workers. When jorquetting takes
place at lower levels this can be raised by
nipping off all the fan branches and
allowing one chupon to develop and grow
further to jorquette at the desired height.
After this is achieved, further vertical growth
is arrested through periodical removal of
chupons.
The intensity of pruning is to be decided by
the nature of growth of individual trees, shade
intensity, growth of the companion crops etc.
161
COCOA
In the early stages, pruning is done to give a
particular shape to the tree. After the
establishment of the trees in the garden, prune
them to the extent of retaining only the required
number of leaves (20-30 leaves per developing
pod). Removal of secondary branches from
the centre should be restricted only to those
trees growing in excess shade.
Irrigation
Cocoa grows well as a rainfed crop
under conditions of well distributed rainfall
and irrigation is not necessary. If sufficient
moisture is not present in the soil due to
prolonged drought or failure of rains, irrigation
is to be given once in five days. Irrigation,
however, helps in better growth of plants and
precocity in bearing.
Top working
This technique is useful to rejuvenate old
and unproductive cocoa plants and also to
convert genetically poor yielders to high
yielders. This consists of snapping back the
desired trees below the jorquette after
cutting half way. The snapped canopy
continues to have contact with the trunk. A
number of chupons would arise below the point
of snapping and this is triggered by the breakage
of apical dominance and continued connection
with the snapped canopy. Patch budding
as described earlier may be done on three
to four vigorous and healthy shoots
using scions from high yielding, disease
resistant clones and the remaining chupons are
removed. The polythene tape is removed
three weeks after budding and the stock
portion above the bud union is snapped back.
The snapped portion is removed after two
hardened leaves develop from the bud. When
sufficient shoots are hardened, canopy of the
mother tree can be completely removed.
Because of the presence of an established root
system and the trunk with reserve food, the
top worked trees grow much faster and give
prolific yield one year after the operation.
Though top working can be done in all seasons,
it is preferable to do it in rain-free period in
irrigated gardens. For rainfed situations, it may
preferably be done after the receipt of pre-
monsoon showers.
Top worked trees start yielding heavily from
the second year onwards. About 50 per cent
improved yield is obtained in the
second year and about 100 per cent improved
yield in the third year. Loss of crop for one
year during the operation is compensated by
bumper crop in the coming years. The main
stem will continue to belong to the older plant
and fruits borne on this area belong to the poor
yielder. Better yields are however obtained
from the fan branches of the high yielding clone
used for top working.
Plant protection
Pests
Red borer (Zeuzera coffeae)
Larvae burrow into the main stem of young
plants and fan shoots of older trees, causing
drying up.
Management
Prune off and burn affected fan shoots.
Striped squirrel (Funambulus sp.)
The squirrels gnaw the bronzing pods and
extract the beans along with mucilaginous pulp.
Management
Harvest the crop just when bronzing is
visible in the pod furrows. Mechanical
protection of the pods can be ensured by
covering them with punched polybags (150
gauge) smeared with bitumen-kerosene
mixture.
COCOA
162
Rats (Rattus rattus)
Rats are serious pests in densely planted
coconut gardens with cocoa as an intercrop.
They inhabit the coconut palm crowns and
descend during night and cause damage to
pods. Nature of damage is similar to that
caused by squirrels.
Management
Baiting with anticoagulant rodenticides in
the garden is recommended. Rain-proof
preparations are to be used.  Set up bamboo
traps with bow attachment on the crown of
palms.
Myllocerus weevils (Myllocerus viridanus)
Adults skeletonise the foliage and this is
serious in young plants during July-September.
Spray undersurfaces of the foliage with
quinalphos 0.05 per cent.
Mealy  bugs  (Planococcus  citri  and
Rastrococcus sp.)
The bugs occur in cherelles, developing pods
and shoots and desap the tissues. This can be
controlled by spot application of quinalphos 0.05
per cent or phosalone 0.07 per cent.
Aphids (Toxoptera aurantii)
Colonies of pink aphids occur ventrally on
the leaves of chupon shoot. Tender shoots are
also damaged.
Management
Nip off the flaccid leaves along with the
shoots and destroy the colonies.
Cockchafer  beetle  (Popillia sp. and
Leucopholis sp.)
Grubs feed on the roots of freshly planted
seedlings causing wilting.
The pods are damaged by Helopeltis sp.
The pest can be controlled by spraying
quinalphos 0.05 per cent.
Diseases
Seedling blight (Phytophthora palmivora)
The symptoms develop on the leaves and
stem of the seedlings or budded plants. On
leaves, small water-soaked lesions appear
which later coalesce resulting in the blightening
of leaves. On stem, water-soaked linear lesions
develop initially and later turn to black colour.
Stem infection develops at any point on the
stem causing the death of seedlings / budded
plants.
Management
Remove and destroy severely affected
seedlings. Improve drainage and adjust shade.
Spray with 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture or
0.2 per cent copper oxychloride or 0.3 per cent
potassium phosphonate just before the onset
of monsoon and thereafter at frequent
intervals.
Phytophthora pod rot / black pod
(Phytophthora palmivora,
P. citrophthora, P. capsici)
Fruits at all stages of maturity may be
attacked by P. palmivora. The first visible
symptom is the appearance of a circular brown
spot, which enlarges concentrically and evenly
to involve the whole pod surface. Ultimately
the colour of the affected pod becomes dark
brown or black. In immature pods, the
discolouration spreads internally with rotting of
the beans. The beans in mature pods may
remain partly or wholly unaffected.
Management
Periodically remove and destroy all dried
up and infected pods. Spray 1 per cent
Bordeaux mixture with adhesive (rosin
washing soda preparation) with the onset of
monsoon and also at frequent intervals.
Provide proper drainage and regulate shade
to increase aeration.
163
COCOA
Lasiodiplodia pod rot / charcoal pod  rot
(Lasiodiplodia theobromae)
The disease occurs more frequently
during dry season. Pods of all stages are
affected. The symptoms appear as pale
yellow spots from the stalk-end or tip of the
pod. Later, the lesions enlarge and cover the
entire pod having chocolate brown colour. In
due course, the whole pod develops a black
sooty appearance due to formation of spores
of the fungus.
Management
Since the disease is more common on pods
of plants under stress, better management
practices will reduce the incidence of the
disease. Remove all affected pods and spray
1 per cent Bordeaux mixture.
Colletotrichum pod rot (Colletotrichum
gloeosporioides)
The disease causes rotting of immature
pods. Infection starts from the stalk-end of the
pod and spreads towards tip as dark brown
discolouration with a diffused yellow halo.
Internal tissues of the pod also show
discolouration. The whole pod turns to black
and remains on the tree in a mummified form.
Sometimes, infection may start from parts other
than the stalk region as dark brown sunken
lesion.
Management
Remove all infected pods and spray with 1
per cent Bordeaux mixture or 0.2 per cent
copper oxychloride or mancozeb.
Phytophthora canker
(Phytophthora palmivora)
The earliest symptom is the appearance of
greyish brown water-soaked lesion with dark
brown to black margin anywhere on the stem.
A reddish brown liquid oozes out from the
lesions, which later dry up to form a rusty
deposit. The internal tissues beneath the outer
greyish brown lesion appear as reddish brown.
The wood shows greyish brown discolouration
with black streaks. Wilting occurs, when
canker girdles the affected stem / branches.
Management
If the disease is detected early, remove and
destroy the affected tissues completely
and apply Bordeaux paste. Wilted branches
should be cut and removed. Since canker
mainly develops from pod rot caused by
Phytophthora, proper control measures of
Phytophthora pod rot will help in reducing
incidence of the disease.
Pink disease (Corticium salmonicolor)
The disease appears as a pinkish powdery
coating on the stem of affected plants.
The pink colour represents profuse conidial
production by the fungus. The fungal growth
may rapidly spread and girdle the stem, so that
the distal parts are affected. The extent to
which the leaf may wilt, turn brown and fall
depends on the part of the tree, which is
affected. The disease mainly affects the
forking region and the damage is localized.
Splitting of the bark on the affected region is
also noticed. Sometimes, the fungus produces
pustules (Necator stage), which are orange red
in colour and are arranged in rows along the
stem.
Management
Remove all the infected and dried branches.
Apply Bordeaux paste at the fork region and
at the cut ends of the twigs and spray with
1 per cent Bordeaux mixture before the onset
of monsoon. Repeat spraying again once or
twice during the monsoon season according to
the intensity of the disease.
COCOA
164
Vascular Streak Dieback (VSD)
(Oncobasidium theobromae)
The first indication of the disease is the
characteristic chlorosis of one or two leaves
on the second or third leaf behind the tip.
Leaves on the tip show symptoms first only in
very young seedlings or in slow growing
seedlings or branches. The chlorotic patches
on the diseased leaves develop into small
sharply defined green spots scattered over a
yellow background. Diseased leaves fall within
a few days after turning yellow. Leaves above
and below the first diseased leaf soon begin to
show yellowing with green patches and these
also fall off finally resulting in dieback of the
infected branches.
Leaf scars from the fall of chlorotic leaves
are sometimes covered by a white, loosely
adherent fruiting body of the fungus. These
fruiting bodies have been found only on leaf
scars and adjacent bark in the diseased
region of cocoa stems. If the diseased stem is
split longitudinally, the xylem is found to be
discoloured by brown streaks.
Management
Cut and remove all infected twigs. Prune
off all affected branches 30 cm below the last
point of visible vascular streak of the stem to
prevent further spread within the plant. Grow
VSD tolerant cocoa types.
White thread blight (Marasmiellus
scandens)
The white mycelial threads of the fungus
spread longitudinally and irregularly along the
surface of the stem of young branches and
enter the leaf along the petioles. On the leaf
lamina it spreads extensively and forms a much
branched system of fine threads. The affected
leaves turn dark brown and such dead leaves
eventually get detached from the stem, but are
found suspended by the mycelial thread.
Extensive death of the young branches and
suspended leaves in rows are the common field
symptoms.
Management
Remove and destroy the affected plant
parts. Avoid heavy shade. Spray 1 per cent
Bordeaux mixture.
Harvesting
It takes about 170 days for a cocoa pod to
develop from formation to maturity.
During the period from 70-140 days after
pollination, the size of pods and their fat and
sugar content increase rapidly. Ripening takes
about 25 days, during which, the pods change
colour depending on the variety. Pods remain
suitable for harvesting for fairly long time
after they have ripened. Hence, it is possible
to have harvest of sufficient number of pods
at a time by either delaying the harvest of early
ripened pods or harvest of pods, which are fully
ripened. Harvesting should be done at regular
intervals rather than daily, once in 7-10 days.
Avoid over ripening of pods. The discards at
the harvest can be left in the garden either in
the open during summer or in pits at different
sites in the rainy season or they can be
incorporated in the compost. Pod husks from
the fermentary can also be used similarly as a
good source of organic manure.
Pods are removed by cutting with a sickle-
sharp knife, without damaging the cushion from
which it is developed. After 2-3 days, they are
split by banging them against some hard objects.
Opening the pods with a knife damages the
beans. During the period between harvesting
and splitting, pre-fermentation activity inside
the pod is hastened, which improves later
fermentation. Beans from the split pods are
scraped out with  fingers. Portions of placenta
broken, germinated, caked, parthenocarpic and
165
COCOA
undeveloped beans are removed. On an
average, 10-12 pods give 1 kg of wet beans
and 3 kg of wet beans (from 30-36 pods) give
1 kg of fermented and dried beans.
Fermentation
During fermentation, the pulp or mucilage
covering the fresh beans is removed and
characteristic chocolate flavour is imparted to
the final produce. The process is simple but
must be carried out properly in order to get
beans of good quality. Heat is produced by
keeping the fresh beans compactly and this
heat must be conserved so that chemical
changes inside the bean can be completed. The
four methods of fermentation usually employed
involve the use of baskets, heaps, boxes and
trays for filling up the wet beans.
Tray method
The best method suitable for small
quantities of beans is the tray fermentation.
Wooden trays, 10 cm deep with slatted / split
cane bottoms are divided into a number of
sections by means of wooden partitions that
fit into appropriate grooves at required
distances. The capacity of the tray can be
adjusted depending upon the availability of
beans by keeping the wooden plank in the
appropriate grooves. A convenient tray can be
25 cm wide and 60 cm long. Wet beans are
filled in the tray and levelled. About
10 kg of wet beans may be required to load
one tray fully.
A single tray of beans will not ferment
properly and at least four or five trays are
needed for successful fermentation. The
trays are stacked one over the other in such
a manner that the cocoa filled portions are in a
single row one above the other. The top
tray is covered with plantain leaves. After
24 hours, a close fitting sack is put to cover
the stack to keep the beans warm. Mixing or
stirring of beans is not necessary and fermen-
tation gets completed in 4 to 5 days, whereas
6 to 7 days are required for other methods of
fermentation.
Basket method
In this method, bean lots ranging from
2-6 kg can be fermented successfully. Mini
baskets may be made of bamboo matting,
closely woven and should have a diameter of
20 cm and height of 15 cm for a capacity of
2 kg. For slightly larger lots, proportionately
deeper baskets may be used (e.g., for 6 kg,
the depth may be about 40 cm). The baskets
are lined with one or two layers of torn banana
leaves to facilitate drainage of sweatings. Wet
beans are then filled, compacted and covered
with banana leaves. The baskets are placed
on a raised platform to allow the flow of
drippings. After 24 hours, it is covered with
gunny-sack and apply weight (bricks). The
beans are to be taken out and stirred well 48
hours and 96 hours after the initial setting.
Fermentation will be completed in six days and
the beans can be taken for drying on the seventh
day.
A number of factors influence the
duration of fermentation. Weather changes
and season are important through their
influence on temperature and atmospheric
moisture. Ripening also affects fermentation.
Beans from unripe pods cannot be
fermented. Beans of Criollo ferment more
quickly than those of Forastero. During the
early stages of fermentation, heat is produced
by the action of anaerobic microorganisms.
The beans are killed by the combined effect
of heat and acetic acid and the cocoa aroma
and flavour potential are developed.
COCOA
166
Judging the end point of fermentation
Well-fermented beans will be plumpy and
filled with a reddish brown exudate. The testa
becomes loosened from the cotyledons. When
cut open, the cotyledons will have a bleached
appearance in the centre with a brownish ring
in the periphery. When above 50 per cent of
beans in a lot show the above signs, it can be
considered as properly fermented.
Drying
On completion of fermentation, beans are
dried either in the sun or by artificial means.
Sun drying can be done in thin layers 2-3 cm
deep and stirring from time to time. Under
normal sunny weather, drying can be
completed in four to five days. While drying in
mechanical driers, care must be taken
to avoid exposure of the beans to smoke, fumes
etc. The most common method of determining
bean dryness is to take a sample and compress
this in the palm of the hand and listen for the
characteristic sound, which is associated with
correctly dried cocoa. The more scientific
method is to use a moisture meter.
Storage
The dried beans with moisture content of
6-8 per cent may be packed in polythene bags
or polythene lined gunny bags. Some special
conditions have to be provided in storage in
order to maintain the quality of the cured beans.
Properly dried beans can be kept in 200-300
gauge polythene covers if only small quantities
are involved or in polythene lined gunny bags
in the case of larger stocks. Beans should be
cleaned of flat, broken and other defective
beans before storing. The store should be
sufficiently ventilated and the bags should be
kept on a wooden platform with air space of
about 15-20 cm below the wooden planks set
over the floor. The humidity should not exceed
80 per cent so as to prevent mould development
and pest incidence in the beans. Before storing
cocoa, the store can be made clean and
insect free by application of pesticides well in
advance, but pesticides should neither be
applied nor be kept with the beans inside the
store. As cocoa beans can absorb and retain
permanently any odour from its surroundings,
other food-stuffs should not be kept with
cocoa. So also, smoke or kerosene fumes
should be prevented from entry.

are tolerant. Araboca varieties recommended
for Nelliampathis & Idukki regions are S.6,
Sln.9, Chandragiri while Cavery & S.795 are
discouraged. Chandragiri should be planted at
elevations of 3000 feet (915 meters) and above.
All Arabica varieties are discouraged  in
Wayanad. Robusta varieties recommended for
Waynad, Nelliampathis & Idukki are S.274 &
CxR (Congensis x robusta hybrid). Generally
robustas are tolerant to leaf rust disease and
resistant to White Stem Borer pest, which are
more on record in arabica. However, mealy
bug incidence will be more in robusta.
Propagation
In coffee, generally the propagation is done
through seeds and of late in robusta, the clonal
propagation was also established to be
successful. To a limited extent, grafted plants
are also being planted.
From the selected and certified seed blocks,
healthy and fully matured fruits of normal
appearance with three quarters of
ripening are harvested selectively from the
marked plants during November-December in
the case of arabicas and in January-
February in robustas. Discarding the floats, the
sound fruits are pulped and sieved to
remove the defective beans. The beans are
then mixed with wood ash @ 0.75 kg per kg
of seeds and dried under shade stirring from
time to time to facilitate uniform drying.
To protect the seeds against any microbial
infection, the seeds are treated with
either carbendazim @ 1 g or with vitavax
@ 0.66 g per kg of seed coffee.
Sowing
Germination bed (primary): Seeds are sown
in raised seed beds (15 cm above the ground
level) provided with proper drainage prepared
out of soil, compost and sand at 6:2:1 proportion.
A bed of 4 m x 3 m will be sufficient for 1.5 kg
Preparation of land
If it is a jungle, only selective felling of trees
is done maintaining the trees, which are
desirable at appropriate spacing. The under
growth may be cleared to enable line
marking with a base line and opening of pits.
The entire plot may be conveniently divided
into blocks with roads and footpaths.
In April, pits of 45 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm
may be opened at appropriate spacing for
different coffee cultivars as described below.
Tall arabica like S 795, S 288 : 2.1 m x 2.1 m
Semi-dwarfs like Cauvery
: 1.8 m x 1.8 m
Dwarfs like S 7 (San Ramon): 1.5 m x 1.5 m
Hybrids like Congensis x
Robusta (CxR)
: 2.5 m x 2.5 m
Robusta selections like
S 274, BR series
: 3.0 m x 3.0 m
The pits after digging will be kept open for
weathering for a couple of months until
monsoon. In June, the pits are covered with
top soil and staked. In poor soils, 250 g of FYM
or compost per pit may be added
before filling.
Planting materials
Old arabica varieties like Kents and Coorgs
are more susceptible to the leaf rust disease
(Hemileia vastatrix). Arabica selections of tall,
medium and dwarf habit are grown on large
scale because of their proven performance in
yield and comparatively better resistance to leaf
rust disease. In dwarfs, San Ramon (S 7, 7.1,
7.2 and 7.3) and in medium size bushes,
Cauvery (Catimor) are the popular varieties.
Some of the arabica selections like Sln 5, 6
and 7 are location specific while S.795 (tall) is
adapted to all areas. All arabicas are
susceptible to leaf rust with varying degree of
susceptiblity. Sln.5, Sl.6, Sln.9 & Chandragiri

of seeds, if sown 1.0 to 1.5 cm apart in rows,
with the flat side of the seed towards the soil.
A thin layer of soil is spread after sowing and
covered with dry straw to a thickness of about
5 cm to ensure uniform temperature and to
regulate moisture retention. Sowing is to be
taken up in December-January for arabica and
in February-March for Robusta. Watering of
the seed beds is to be done twice a day in the
initial week and thereafter regulated. The
seeds sprout in about 40 days when the straw
mulch is removed. The primary beds are
provided with pandal covered with coir mats
or dry leaves.
Polybag (basket) nursery : Seedlings from
germination beds are transplanted to polythene
bags in February-March when they are at the
‘button’ stage. Polythene bags of 23 cm x
15 cm and 150 gauge thickness with adequate
number of holes of 3 mm in the bottom half of
the bag are preferred. The bags are filled with
prepared mixture of 6 parts of sieved jungle
soil, 2 parts of well rotten sieved cattle manure
and 1 part of fine sand. The prepared mixture
is thoroughly mixed and slightly moistened with
water to facilitate packing. The soil is filled
into the nursery baskets and pressed firm.
Nursery baskets are arranged conveniently in
rows of 10 within a rectangular frame with
bamboo reapers. These frames are held in
positions with bamboo or wooden props driven
into the ground at suitable distance.
Coffee seedlings at the button stage are
transplanted into nursery baskets. The
seedlings are gently lifted from the germination
beds with minimum injury to roots. Prior to
transplanting, the nursery basket is watered and
a vertical hole of 5 cm deep is made in the soil
at the centre of the basket. At the time of
transplanting it is preferable to slightly nip off
the taproot of the seedling. The taproot and
the feeder roots should be so disposed as to
enable the plant to strike roots and make firm
growth as quickly as possible. The shoot portion
of the transplanted seedling should be at the
same height above soil level as it was in the
germination bed. Transplanting is done
preferably in the early morning hours or late in
the afternoon. Seedlings uprooted from the
primary bed should not be stored for a long
time but transplanted immediately.
Regular watering and aftercare of the
seedlings should follow. Excess moisture and
watering in the afternoon should be avoided
as it may induce damping off.
Secondary nursery beds
In some areas, seedlings from the
germination beds are transplanted to secondary
nursery beds of the same soil composition as
that of germination beds. Transplanting is
done at button stage. Seedlings are planted
30 cm apart. If the taproot is bent or
excessively grown, it is nipped off while
transplanting. The beds are mulched and
watered at regular intervals. Watering should
be done during the early morning hours.
Aftercare of seedlings
Seedlings are to be manured once in two
months with urea dissolved in water or
supernatant solution of fermented cowdung
slurry. For an area of 1 m2, 20 g urea
dissolved in 4.5 litres water is sufficient.
Adequate protection is given against
nursery diseases and pests. Overhead shade
in the nursery has to be thinned and finally
removed after the onset of monsoon (this is
not applicable to northeastern areas). The
seedlings grow vigorously if watered
judiciously and protected against afternoon sun.
Planting in field
Disease free and vigorous seedlings are
selected for planting. Seedlings with stunted
169
COFFEE
and twisted roots are discarded. Rooted plants
(aged 16-18 months) with and without ball are
planted during June and bag plants are generally
planted during September-October. A hole is
made at the centre of the pit after levelling the
soil. The seedling is placed in the hole with its
taproot and lateral roots spread out in proper
position. The hole is then filled. The soil around
the seedling is packed 3 cm high above the
ground to prevent stagnation of water around
the collar. The seedlings are provided with cross
stakes to prevent wind damage and mulched
properly.
Ball and bag seedlings are planted
towards the end of the heavy monsoon rains
and commencement of northeast rains, i.e., in
September. First the bottom portion of the bag
is cut and the tip of the root is nipped. The
seedling is gently removed from the bag with
its soil and root system intact and planted in
the hole. The hole is covered with soil and the
plant is firmly fixed similar to ball plants. It is
wise to maintain both types of nurseries and
have planting seasons, June and September.
Planting shade trees\
Dadap is commonly used as a lower canopy
shade only in arabicas which require two tier
canopy. Stakes of 2 m length are planted for
every two plants of coffee. Silver oak and
dadap are planted during June when the
southwest monsoon commences. During the
dry seasons, stems of young dadap are either
painted with dilute lime solution or wrapped in
agave leaves to protect them from sun scorch.
Clonal propagation
In the case of robusta, which is highly cross
pollinated clonal propagation is more adaptable.
In the case of arabica, the stabilization of
desirable characters in the selected plants could
be easily maintained by adopting clonal or
vegetative propagation method. The vertical
(orthotropic) shoots are marked after harvest
is over in any selected plant. Single node green
wood (semi-hardwood) cutting of 10 cm length
and three to six months old are planted in
polythene bags with the medium of jungle soil,
sand and cattle manure in the proportion of
6:3:1. The bags with cuttings are arranged in a
propagation chamber made of a trench of size
2 m x 1 m x 0.5 m  covered over with a thick
polythene sheet (500 gauge) spread over a
framework of bamboos.
A trench could accommodate about 108
filled up bags of size 22 cm x 15 cm.
Preplanting treatment of the base of cutting
with IBA (indole butyric acid) at 5000 ppm
enhances early rooting. Under South Indian
conditions, cuttings collected during June-July
recorded the highest per cent of rooting.
Cuttings will root in 3-4 months after planting.
Rooted cuttings should be hardened by keeping
them under shade for about two months and
then can be transplanted into the field.
Manuring
The recommended doses of fertilizers for
coffee (kg ha-1) are furnished in Tables 29 & 30.
After cultivation
Grass and other weeds should be
eradicated in the first year itself by digging or
using appropriate weedicide depending on the
nature of the weeds. The soil around the
seedlings should be mulched properly and
shade has to be provided to individual
seedlings to protect against direct sun.
Training and pruning
The plant is trained either on single stem or
multiple stem system. Under South Indian
conditions periodical handling and pruning are
essential. The type and frequency of pruning
have to be decided based on a number of
factors like the type of vegetative growth,

incidence of pests / diseases, pattern of
blossom showers etc. Centering and
desuckering are to be carried out for about
5 or 6 years after planting. Removal of the
dead and whippy wood is essential during the
early years. Mature plants may require
medium to severe pruning once in four years.
Usually coffee, both arabica and robusta,
is trained on single stem. When the plants reach
a desired height of 75 cm for arabica and
105-120 cm for robusta, they are topped i.e.,
growing apex of the stem is severed. Low
topping (60-70 cm) is advocated in areas of
severe wind and exposure. Under certain
circumstances, multiple stem system is also
adopted as in the case of replanted fields or
when under-planting is taken up keeping the
old plants under multiple stem system.
Irrigation
Wherever water is available, overhead
irrigation by sprinkler system is adopted to a
greater advantage during November-
January to keep the soil moisture level and in
February-April for ensuring blossom as well
as backing, if necessary.
Drought management in coffee
Plants affected by drought limit vegetative
growth, show floral abnormalities and poor fruit
set resulting in reduced yield. Therefore,
drought tolerance is an important aspect of
coffee productivity. Arabica coffee is more
tolerant to drought than robusta. For inducing
tolerance in robusta the following nutrient
solution can be sprayed @ 1 litre per plant.

2nd spray: 30-45 days after the first spray
Foliar application of anti-transpirants like
Ralli Dhan 110 @ 200 ml in 200 litres of water
(0.1per cent) is also useful for drought
management in coffee.
Fruit drop
During the developmental stage of berry,
10 to 50 per cent premature fruit drop
occurs due to insufficient carbohydrate, auxin-
carbohydrate 
imbalance, 
nutritional
disorders and waterlogging. Many growth
regulators have been tried to increase the
fruit set and for controlling the pre-mature
fruit drop. Following growth regulators could
increase the yield when they are given as
foliar application 10-15 days after blossom (first
spray) and during last week of May before
the onset of southwest monsoon (second
spray).
Fruit ripening
Hastening of fruit ripening in coffee could
be achieved by spraying ethephon (Ethrel) on
mature berries when 10 per cent natural
ripening is observed. By this, ripening can be
hastened by 2-4 weeks and in two rounds about
COFFEE
172
96 per cent ripe fruits could be harvested. The
following concentrations are standardized for
arabica and robusta plants.
Arabica : 100 to 120 ml per 200 litres of water
per 400 plants
Robusta : 40 to 54 ml per 200 litres of
water per 267 plants
Lower concentrations are to be used in
lower elevations and thin shaded places,
whereas higher concentrations are to be used
in higher elevation and thick shaded
plantations.
Dieback
Dieback refers to death of younger tertiary
branches starting from apex progressing
downwards as well as dieback from below the
tip of branches and proceeding forward and
backward from the point of defoliation. The
occurrence of dieback is mainly due to adverse
climatic and edaphic factors such as higher
temperature, higher light intensity and low
moisture status of soil.
Management
1. Removal of dead and whippy wood
2. Providing judicious shade by both
temporary and permanent shade trees as
70 per cent of daylight is found to be
optimum
3. Conservation of soil moisture with thick
mulch
4. Foliar application of nutrients
5. Correcting the soil acidity by application
of lime
Shade and shade management
Dadap (Erythrina lithosperma) is
generally used as a lower canopy in India. It is
always planted along with coffee in new
clearings. When stakes are planted in June
they grow quickly since sufficient moisture
will be there in the soil. In areas where the
establishment of dadap is difficult due to poor
rooting, application of rooting hormones and
manuring have been found useful.
Diseases
Leaf rust (Hemileia vastatrix)
This is an important disease causing
economic loss particularly in arabica coffee.
On the lower surface of the infected leaves,
small pale yellowish spots appear early
after the first rains in the season. These spots
soon increase in size and number, and many
such spots coalesce at severity causing
premature defoliation. Severe defoliation leads
to debilitation of the bushes and results in poor
cropping in the succeeding seasons.
Management
a. Spraying of Bordeaux mixture 0.5%
before the onset of south west monsoon
and during post monsoon.
b. Systemic fungicides, Triadimefon (Bayleton
25 WP) at 160 g per 200 l of water),
Hexaconazole (Contaf 5% EC) at 400 ml
per 200 l
  of water are recomended as
alternatives to Bordeaux spray.
Bordeaux mixture 0.5 per cent in February-
March as pre or post-blossom spray,
Oxycarboxin 20 EC 0.03 per cent ai in May-
June as pre-monsoon spray, Oxycarboxin 20
EC 0.03 per cent ai or Bordeaux mixture 0.5
per cent in July-August in mid-monsoon spray
(if incidence of leaf rust is severe), and
Oxycarboxin 20% EC 0.03 per cent ai or
Bordeaux mixture 0.5 per cent in September-
October as post-monsoon spray.
Black rot (Koleroga noxia)
A disease more in occurrence in endemic
areas with heavy rainfall, saturated atmos-
phere with 95-100 per cent RH, thick overhead
shade, low over-hanging branches, sheltered
from sunlight and wind in valleys or continuous

COFFEE
mist during monsoon. The affected bushes have
blackening and rotting of leaves, twigs and
developing berries. There will be defoliation
and berry drop in the affected branches. The
entire block affected looks totally debilitated
with heavy damage to crop.
Management
Centering and handling of the bushes prior
to the onset of monsoon and protecting
endemic patches with spraying Bordeaux
mixture 1 per cent. If incidence is observed
during the monsoon, remove the affected twigs
and burn them.
a. In endamic areas spray 1% Bordeaux
mixture on both the surfaces of leaves and
also to the developing berries just before the
onset of monsoon.
b. If disease is noticed, remove and destroy
the affected leaves and berries along with
strands of mycelia to prevent further spread.
c. Spray Carbendazim 0.03% (Bavistin at
120g/200 l of water in black rot affected
areas during break in the monsoon.
Pests
Coffee berry borer
(Hypothenemus hampei)
Coffee berry borer is the most serious pest
of coffee world over. The female beetle bores
into the berries through the navel region and
makes tunnels in the hard bean and lays about
15 eggs. The larvae feed on the beans, making
small tunnels. A typical pinhole at the tip of the
berries indicates the presence of the pest and
it damages young as well as ripe berries. In
case of severe infestation, 30 to 80 per cent
berries may be affected resulting in heavy crop
loss. The coffee berry borer can be controlled
by the following methods.
Management
1. Timely and complete harvest, collection of
gleanings, burying the infested berries and
maintaining optimum shade and good
drainage can control the pest.
2. Timely & clean harvest using picking mat
and phytosanitary measures like removal of
left over berries on the plant and gleanings
(berries fallen on the ground) are the most
effective measures to contain the CBB.
3. Release of parasitoid C. stephanoderis and
application of entomopatheogen B.
bassiana and installing Broca traps @ 60
nos. per ha.for mass trapping are more
effective in containing the pest.
4. Although a number of pesticides have been
tried against this pest, only a few are
effective. Pesticides should be used with
extreme caution and only if no other option
is available.
For spot sprays, Chloropyriphos 20 EC at
600 ml in 200 l of water along with 200 ml of
any wetting agent may be used at the right time
ie 120 to 150 days after blossom. (Aug-Sept for
Arabica and Sept-Oct for robusta) can control
the pest.
White stem borer
(Xylotrechus quadripes)
The adults have two flight periods as they
emerge from the pupae during April-May and
in September to December/January. As the
beetles are active and females lay eggs in the
crevices on the main stem of coffee.
1. Tracing, collar prunning/uprooting the
infested plants and burn prior to flight
periods ie. before the end of March &
September every year. If the uprooted
stems are intended for fuel purpose, then
such stems should be immersed under
water for atleast 10 days.
COFFEE
174
2. Spraying of Chloropyriphos 20 EC at 600
ml in 200 lit of water along with 200 ml
wetting agent on the main stem and thick
primaries during early part of flight
period; April and October every year.
3. In hot spot areas; in open patches and
estate borders with badly managed estates
adopt bark scrubbling or 10% lime
coating or stem wrapping with 5’’ wide
strips cut from fertilizer bags after removing
the affected plants by tracing.
Apart from this, it is necessary to build up
good shade and regularly trace, uproot stump
and burn the infested plants. Storing of cut
stems is not advisable, as it will advance the
flight period.
Shot hole borer (Xylosandrus compactus)
This is a major pest in robusta coffee
affecting the secondary and tertiary branches
causing considerable damage. Injury to the
coffee plants is primarily by the extensive tun-
neling within the branches, which limits the flow
of sap. The affected branches dry up. The
presence of withering and dead branches with
shot holes is the symptom of attack.
Management
1.
Prune the affected twigs 5-8 cm beyond
the shot hole and burn. This operation
should commence from September
onwards, as soon as the first symptom of
attack like dropping of leaves is noticed
and continued as a routine measure at
regular intervals.
2.
The pest prefers to breed in the suckers
during dry period. So remove and destroy
all the unwanted/infested suckers during
summer.
Mealy bugs (Planococcus sp.)
Mealy bugs damage coffee plants by
sucking the sap from the tender branches,
nodes, leaves, spikes, berries and roots
leading to the debilitation of the plant. In case
of root infestation, plants (especially young)
become weak, leading to death.
Management
1.
Release natural enemies like the
parasitoid Leptomastix dactylopii
against Planococcus citri or the
predator, ladybird beetle, Cryptolaemus
montro- uxieri against all species of
mealybugs.
2.
Control ants by dusting Quinalphos 1.5%
or Methyl parathion 2% or Malathion 5%
dust around the base of the plant.
3.
Spray the affected patches with 2%
Kerosene emulsion (4 l of kerosene in 200
l of water along with 200 ml of any wetting
agent). Care should be taken to emulsify
kerosene thoroghly.
4.
Quinalphos 25 EC at 300 ml in 200 l of
water with 200 ml wetting agent can be
used as spot spray.
5.
If the root is affected, drench the root
zone with Dimethoate at 0.09% a.i.
(600ml in 200 l of water.
Green scale (Coccus viridis)
The green scale is a serious sucking pest
of coffee particularly arabica.
Management
The chemical control measures include
spraying the affected patches with any one of
the following insecticides viz. cythion
50 EC @ 200 ml, quinalphos 25 EC @ 120 ml
or dimethoate 30 EC @ 170 ml.

COFFEE
TEA (Camellia sinensis)
Tea grows best in areas with a maximum
temperature of 16-32 ºC and a well distri-
buted rainfall of about 150 cm per annum.
Relative humidity should be around 80 per cent
most of the time and should never be less than
40 per cent. The area should not be prone to
frost. The soil should be acidic (around  pH
5.0) having good drainage facility.
Varieties
Clones : UPASI-2, UPASI-8, UPASI-9,
UPASI-17, TRI-2025, TRF-1
Seedlings : BSS-1, BSS-2
Propagation
The seed viability extends up to 6 months.
Before sowing, seeds are put in water and only
the sinkers will be used and floaters
rejected. Seeds germinate in 4-6 weeks and
the cracked seeds are transplanted in polythene
sleeves. The plants will be ready for planting in
the main field in nine months.
Manuring of nursery plants
Composition of tea nursery mixture is as
follows:
Ammonium phosphate (20:20)    60 parts
Potassium sulphate                    24 parts
(or) Muriate of potash                  20 parts
Magnesium sulphate                      16 parts
Stock solution Dissolve 30 g of the
mixture in 10 litres of water. This can be sprayed
over 2 m2 (450 plants) at weekly interval.
Field preparation
In the case of new planting, in order to avoid
the incidence of root diseases, after felling the
trees, remove the root system to the extent
possible. Clear the jungle growth but do not
burn, the ash being alkaline will increase the
pH.
In the case of replanting, remove old
Grevillea (silver oak) after ring barking, leaving
the young ones in the field. Level the land into
an even slope to facilitate easy cultural
operations and proper drainage.
Style of planting
Up and down
:1.2 m x 1.2 m (6800
plants ha-1)
Contour planting, single hedge:1.2 m x 0.75 m
(10,800 plants ha-1)
Contour planting, double hedge: 1.35 m x
 0.75 m x 0.75 m
(13200 plants ha-1)
The double hedge planting will
accommodate more number of plants per unit
area. Early high yield, better soil conservation,
less weed growth, efficient cultural practices
and better supervision are other advantages
of double hedge planting.
Pitting
Pits of size 30 cm x 45 cm are taken. Keep
the top and bottom soil separately. In clayey
soil and drought-prone areas, deeper pits
(60 cm) or trench planting will be advanta-
geous.
Planting seasons
Southwest monsoon areas: June-July
Northeast monsoon areas: September-
October
Planting
If the soil pH is more than 5.5, apply
100 g of powdered aluminium sulphate per pit
and thoroughly mix with soil. Select
seedlings of 12 months old. After planting the
seedling, compact the soil surrounding the plant
and apply mulch @ 25 t ha-1. While mulching
TEA
176
Apply phosphorus at 90 kg ha-1 every year
in one application. The quantity of fertilizer per
bush may be calculated assuming a
population of 13,000 per ha.
Rates of application for soils with pH
between 4.5 and 5.5 are as follows:
care should be taken to keep the mulch material
away from the collar region of the plant by
putting a peg above the plant on the slope.
Wherever mulch material is a problem, intercrop
or cover crop could be raised.
Manuring
Manuring of young tea commences
two months after planting. The ratio and source
of nutrients vary according to soil reaction
(pH).

mature tea varies with yield and soil test
values while the N:K2O ratio varies with the
stage of pruning.
Method of application
Apply the recommended quantity of
mixtures along the drip circle of plants. In the
semi-circular furrow taken above the plant on
the slope, using a Kokra-eyebrow method,
apply the fertilizers when there is adequate soil
moisture and when the fields are free from
weeds. Punch holes of 15-22 cm depth in the
soil on either side of the plants and place the
rock phosphate.
Training of young tea
Proper training of young tea is essential to
encourage good spread of the bushes, proper
development of frames and high density of
plucking points.
Centering
Cut the leader stem of the plants with
secateur to arrest the apical dominance and to
induce the secondary branches. Cut as low as
possible leaving 8-10 mature leaves
below the cut. Ensure proper recovery.
Centering should be done 4-6 months after
planting during humid weather when there is
adequate moisture in the soil.
Tipping
First plucking of the periodic shoot is done
after centering / pruning. Two-tier tipping

TEA
ensures proper spread. First tipping at 35 cm
height will induce the tertiaries. Second
tipping at 50 cm height will increase the
density of plucking points. Tipping should be
done at green, semi-hardwood branches.
Tipping should be done in shoots having
3-4 leaves and a bud.
Plucking
Mother leaf / step-up plucking is
practiced during lean seasons. Level plucking
is done during high cropping months. This is
essential for better frame development.
Shade management
The best permanent shade tree for tea plan-
tation in South India is silver oak (Grevillea
robusta).
Planting of silver oak
The silver oak can be propagated through
seeds. The seeds should be sown within
six months after collection. Seed should be sown
in raised beds of 1 m width and of convenient
length using sandy loam soil with a pH around
6.0. Seed should be covered with thin layer
of sand / ash. Germination takes place in
2-3 weeks. Use 6-9 month old seedlings for
planting. Plant along tea rows at a spacing of
6 m  x 6 m (275 plants/ha). Apply a mixture of
100 g rock phosphate and 400 g dolomite per
pit and thoroughly mix with soil prior to
planting. Apply NK mixture @ 100 g/tree twice
in a year; rock phosphate at 250 g/tree and
borated lime 1.1 kg (1 kg dolomite + 100 g
boric acid) during alternate years.
Shade regulation
Tea requires only sparse shade. So retain
optimum stand of shade based on the growth
of the tree, altitude of the garden and aspect
of the field (south and west slopes require more
shade). Thin out shade initially to 12 m  x 6 m
after 8-10 years of planting and if
required further thinning may be done to
12 m  x 12 m at later stages (12 years
from planting). Always thin out shade prior to
pruning.
Pollarding
Cutting the main stem with the objective of
developing lateral branches is pollarding. Com-
mence pollarding when the trees attain a girth
of around 50 cm at elbow level. Pollarding
depends on altitude (8 m height for higher
altitude, 9 m for low elevation). Leave one
branch in each direction and 3 to four tiers of
branches, below the pollarding height.
Annual lopping
Cutting the erect growing branches on the
laterals is lopping, which should be done
before the onset of monsoon and lop only the
erect branches and retain the laterals.
Shade removal
Potential age of Grevillea is 40-60 years.
Remove old trees after establishing new shade.
Temporary shade
For frost prone areas: Acacia mearnsii
For mid elevations: Indigofera teysmanii
For higher altitude: Sesbania cinerescens,
Crotalaria agathiflora and Acacia elata
Planting at 3 m x 3 m spacing is adopted.
Temporary shade should be removed after
establishment of Grevilliea after 3 years.
Plucking
Ten commandments for plucking
1.
Harvest two to three leaves and a bud
and / single and two-leaf banjis.
2.
Pluck the mother leaf during January-
March.
3.
Pluck the new level during rest of the
month.

Pruning
Post-pruning care
Apply copper oxychloride or sulphur+
linseed oil (1:1) to large cut-ends after
rejuvenation and hard pruning.
Plant protection
Nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.)
These microscopic worms infest roots,
which develop to knots or galls. Affected roots
become defunct and devoid of lateral roots.
Plants exhibit chlorosis and stunted growth.
Management
Nursery
Heat treatment: Spread soil sand mixture
(5 cm thick) on a G.I. sheet. Heat it from
below. Sprinkle water periodically. Mix the soil
thoroughly by turning. Optimum temperature
is 60-65ºC. Soil should not be too hot to hold in
the hand. Over heating of soil will lead to man-
ganese toxicity.
Mature tea
Neem cake 2 kg per bush is recommended.
White/cockchafer grubs (Holotrichia sp.)
The creamy white grub eats away the roots.
The main symptoms are ring barking of stem,
chlorosis and defoliation. The pest is a serious
problem in areas where un-decomposed farm-
yard manure is used.
Management
Nursery : Heat treatment of soil is effective.
New clearing : Drench chlorpyriphos or quinal-
        phos 0.05 per cent.
(1) At the time of planting: 500 ml per pit.
(2) Post-planting treatment: Loosen the soil
around the bush and pour one litre per bush.
Root mealy bug (Dysmicoccus sp.)
The pest is a problem in the nursery. It sucks
sap from the callusing region, mother leaf peti-
ole and axillary buds. This arrests root devel-
opment; leads to mother-leaf fall and finally
death of plant.It can be controlled by spraying
and soil drenching with chlorpyriphos or
quinalphos 0.05 per cent.
Stem borers
Red coffee borer (Zeuzera coffeae)
Mostly seen in new clearings as batches.
Young stems are bored and larvae tunnel
downward, make holes at intervals to eject
excreta and wood particles. Frass and
excreta are seen around plants. Alternate host
of the pest is coffee and cocoa.
Large hepialid borer
(Sahyadrassus malabaricus)
This is a polyphagous pest attacking teak,
eucalyptus and lantana. Thick branches
(3 cm diameter) are preferred by the pest.
Callus tissue and wood form food for
179
TEA
larvae. Entrance holes are covered with frassy
mat formed with chewed wood and silk.
Management
Cut the affected stem and pour quinalphos
using ink filler. The holes are plugged with clay
paste.
Mites
Several species of mites attack tea plants.
They are dry weather pests mostly attacking
mature foliage except pink and yellow mites.
Management
If infestation is more, quinalphos will be
effective.
Thrips (Scirtothrips bispinosus)
This is a major pest in all tea growing coun-
tries. Feeding causes lacerations of
tissue and appears as streaks. Leaf surface
becomes uneven, curled and matty. Feeding
marks in bud appear as parallel lines on
either side of mid-rib when leaf unfolds. Leaf
margins turn yellow.
Management
Phosalone, quinalphos and dimethoate can
be used for the pest control.
Tea mosquito bug (Helopeltis theivora)
Adults and nymphs suck the sap from buds,
young leaves and tender stems. Due to inten-
sive feeding, leaves curl up, badly
deform and shoots dry up. Chemical control
involves spraying quinalphos + dichlorvos at
spray intervals depending on the intensity of
incidence.
Root diseases
Black root disease (Rosellinia arcuata)
Common in areas, which were previously
under jungles. The common symptoms are
wilting, chlorosis, drying without defoliation and
death of bush.
Management
Remove surface mulches around 10
metres. Drench soil with mancozeb 30 g per
10 litres of water. Follow phytosanitary
measures. Biocontrol agents Trichoderma or
Gliocladium (200 g per pit) may be incorpo-
rated at the time of planting.
Other root diseases are red root disease
(Poria hypolateritia), brown root disease
(Fomes noxius), root splitting disease
(Armillaria mellea) and xylaria root disease
(Xylaria sp.). Phytosanitary measures, use of
biocontrol agents and chemical control (drench
soil with tridemorph or hexaconazole 0.5 per
cent) are recommended.
Stem diseases
Collar canker (Phomopsis theae)
Seen mostly on young tea. The pathogen
invades stem mostly through open
wound. The predisposing factors for the
disease are deep planting, planting in
gravelly soils, mulching closer to collar,
wounds caused by weeding implements,
fertilizer application close to collar, pegging,
low moisture status in bark and surface
watering during dry weather. The main
symptoms are chlorosis, cessation of growth,
profuse flowering and canker on stem.
Management
Remove affected portion by pruning the
healthy wood and apply copper fungicide to
cut ends.
Other stem diseases are branch
canker (Macrophoma theicola),woodrot
(Hypo-xylon 
serpens) 
and 
dieback
(Leptothyrium theae).
TEA

Leaf disease
Blister blight (Exobasidium vexans)
The fungus affects only tender leaves and
stems (pluckable shoots). Translucent spots
occur in three to ten days and well developed
lesions are seen in two weeks. Lesions are
sunken on the upper surface and convex at
lower surface. Affected leaves are
distorted and irregularly rolled. Stem
Tobacco is generally raised as a cold
weather crop, the optimum temperature range
being 18 to 27ºC. The crop prefers well-drained
fertile soil. Acidic soils are also suitable. It is
sensitive to waterlogging.
Season
October-February
Seeds and sowing
Raised nursery beds of 1 m width and of
convenient length should be prepared for
raising seedlings. The beds should be
manured with well rotten FYM @ 1 kg/m2.
About 75 g seeds sown over an area of
100 m2 will give the required number of
seedlings for planting one hectare. Seeds may
be mixed with fine sand or ash @ 1:15 by
weight and broadcasted. It is covered by
raking or by brushing. Watering may be done
using rose-can. It is desirable to apply 1 kg of
ammonium sulphate per 100 m2 of
nursery in liquid form and the application is
repeated at tri-weekly intervals. Seedlings will
be kept in the nursery for about 8-10 weeks.
Pandal may be provided for shade.
Main field planting
Seedlings are transplanted on flat beds. The
nursery is irrigated well a day before planting
to facilitate easy pulling out of the seedlings.
Seedlings are planted 10-15 cm deep in the
main field at a spacing of 85 cm x 85 cm.
Manuring
Cattle manure @ 5-10 t ha-1 for cigarette
tobacco and 50-60 t ha-1 for hookah tobacco
may be applied as basal dose. Apply
fertilizers (kg ha-1) as shown below:
TOBACCO (Nicotiana tabacum)
infection leads to goose-neck shape, dieback
and snapping at the point of infection.
Management
Copper oxychloride 350 g + plantamycin
70 g per ha at 3 to 4 days interval can control
the disease.

three hoeings are to be given at fortnightly
intervals. Keep the field free of weeds.
Irrigate as and when necessary.
Topping and de-suckering
Remove the terminal bud at the time of
flowering. In the case of chewing tobacco, the
number of leaves to be maintained varies from
8-15. Remove the suckers as and when
produced.
Harvesting
Harvesting is done either by removing the
mature leaves or by cutting the stalk when
maximum leaves are matured. The harvested
leaves are cured for the purpose for which the
produce is meant.
Plant protection
Important pests and diseases of tobacco and
their control measures are given below:
Stem borer (Phthorimoea spp.)
Use healthy seedlings for planting.
Tobacco caterpillar (Spodoptera litura)
1. Destroy egg masses and groups of
caterpillars found on the leaves.
2. Prevent oviposition on nursery plants by
covering the beds at night with gunny
sheets.
Bacterial wilt
1. Use resistant / tolerant varieties.
2. Rotate with resistant crops.
3. Do not let in irrigation water or drainage
water from infested fields.
4. Discard all seedlings from infested
nursery.
Damping off
1. Drench the nursery bed with cheshunt
compound solution 3-4 days before
sowing.
2. Spray the seedlings with mancozeb 0.3 per
cent

VEGETABLES
Under this chapter, package of practices for
amaranth, okra, cucurbitaceous vegetables,
solanaceous vegetables, cool season vegetables
and minor vegetables are furnished. A seperate
table showing the waiting period for insecti-
cides on vegetables has been included. Con-
trol of pests of vegetables with the help of non-
chemical insecticides and tips for vegetable
seed production are also given under seperate
titles. Certain recommendations given under
the non-chemical control of pests have not
been included under the respective crops to
avoid repetition.
AMARANTH (Amaranthus spp.)
Amaranth is the most popular leafy
vegetable of Kerala. It can be grown
throughout the year. Avoid sowing or planting
of red leaved varieties during periods of
heavy rain.
Varieties
Red: Kannara Local, Arun and Krishnasree.
Green: Co-1, Co-2, Co-3, Mohini and
Renusree
Note :Kannara Local is a season bound
variety, which comes to flowering in
November-December.
Seed rate: 1.5 to 2.0 kg ha-1
Preparation of land
Prepare the land by ploughing or digging
followed by levelling. Then shallow trenches
of width 30-35 cm are made 30 cm apart. Well
rotten FYM is mixed with soil in the trenches.
Transplant 20-30 day old seedlings in the
shallow trenches at a distance of 20 cm in two
rows. During rainy season planting shall be
done on raised beds.
Manuring
Apply 50 tonnes of FYM per ha as basal
dose before planting fertlizer recommendation
is 100:50:50 kg ha-1. After preparing trenches,
apply N:P2O5:K2O @ 50:50:50 kg ha-1. Another
50 kg of N can be applied at regular intervals
as top dressing. Spraying 1 per cent urea
immediately after each harvest will increase
the yield.
Plant protection
As far as possible, avoid use of insecticides
or fungicides. In severe cases of leaf webber
attack, spray malathion 0.1 per cent or dust
malathion 10 per cent DP.
Diseases
For controlling leaf blight following
practices are recommended
1. Pseudomonas fluorescens - 2% (foliar
spray + Trichoderma viride - 2% (soil
application)
2. Turmeric powder + baking soda mixture
(5:1 ratio/litre) (foliar spray and soil drenching).
3. Cow dung slurry supernatant 2% +
Pseudomonas fluorescens 2% (foliar spray
and soil drenching).

AMARANTH
OKRA (Abelmoschus esculentus)
The three main planting seasons for
Okra are February-March, June-July and
October-November.
Varieties
Green / light green fruited: Pusa Sawani,
Pusa Makhmali, IARI Selection 2, Kiran,
Salkeerthi.
Red fruited: Co-1, Aruna
Yellow vein mosaic resistant/tolerant: Arka
Anamika, Arka Abhay, Susthira, Anjitha,
Manjima (all green fruited).
Seed rate
The seed rate is 8.5 kg ha-1 for the summer
crop sown in February-March and
7 kg ha-1 for kharif crop.
Storage of seeds
Packing of okra seeds in polythene cover
(700 gauge) increases the storage life upto
7 months.
Planting
For kharif crop, sow the seeds at a
spacing of 60 cm between rows and 45 cm
between plants. For the summer crop, soak
the seeds in water for 24 hours before
sowing and give a spacing of 60 cm x 30 cm.
Manuring
Apply FYM  @ 20 t ha-1 as basal dose. At
the time of sowing apply N, P2O5 and K2O @
55, 35and 70 kg ha-1. Another 55 kg N ha-1
may be applied one month after sowing.
Note: For reclaimed soils of Kuttanad, a
fertilizer dose of N:P2O5:K2O 75:5:15 kg
ha-1 is recommended.
Apply FYM or compost @ 25t/ha as basal
dose. Top dressing with groundnut cake
1 kg / 10 litre (50 kg ha-1) at fortnight intervals
upto flowering.  Groundnut cake soaked for 3
days and the supernatant solution serve as the
spray fluid.
After cultivation
Give pre-sowing irrigation, if soil is not moist
enough. During summer, irrigate at
intervals of 2 to 3 days. Conduct weeding
regularly and earth up rows during rainy
season.
Plant protection
The important pests are jassids, fruit and
shoot borer and root knot nematode.
Against jassids, use quinalphos 0.05 per
cent or imidacloprid 17.8% SL20g ai/ha or
thiamethoxam 25% WG 25g ai/ha as
foliar sprays. For controlling fruit and shoot
borers, remove all drooping shoots and
damaged fruits. Spray emamectin benzoate
5% SG @ 10 g ai/ha or chlorantraniliprole 18.5
SC @ 30 g ai/ha at an interval of 15 days.
For the control of nematodes, apply
sawdust or paddy husk at 500 g/plant or
neem leaves or Eupatorium leaves at 250 g/
plant in basins one week prior to planting and water
daily. The effect of this treatment persists up to
75 days after sowing in summer season.
For managing root knot nematode, seed
treatment 
with 
Bacillus 
macerans
@ 3 per cent w/w. (2.5kg ha-1) and in heavily
infested area seed treatment with B. macerans
@ 3 per cent w/w. and drenching with B.
macerans @ 3 per cent solution 30 days after
sowing can be recommended.
In general, insecticides of plant origin may
be used, as far as possible.
OKRA
184
Yellow vein mosaic
This is a common disease in okra, which
shows vein clearing and vein chlorosis of leaves.
The yellow network of veins is very
conspicuous and veins and veinlets are
thickened. Fruits become small and yellowish
green in colour. White fly (Bemisia tabaci) is
the vector. Cultivate resistant varieties like Arka
Anamika, Arka Abhay and Susthira.
Destruction of weeds (Croton sparsiflora
and Ageratum sp.) is very necessary.
Cercospora leaf spot
For the management of Cercospora leaf
spot, foliar spraying of Trichoderma viride
2 %  thrice at fortnightly interval on both surface
of leaves on symptoms appearance or
Pseudomonas fluorescens 2% thrice at 14
days interval.

CUCURBITACEOUS  VEGETABLES
BITTER GOURD (Momordica charantia)
Bitter gourd is an important cucurbit-
aceous vegetable of Kerala.
Season
January-March and September-December
are the ideal seasons. For the rainfed crop,
sowing can be started after the receipt of first
few showers during May-June.
Varieties
Priya, Preethi, Priyanka and Arka Harit are
high yielding varieties. Priyanka is recom-
mended for acid alluvial soils of Kerala.
Seed rate: 5.0 – 6.0 kg ha-1
Soacking seeds in 1:10 solution of 150 ppm
Pottasium Nitrate for 3 hrs increases germi-
nation and seedling vigour.
Spacing: 2.0 m x 2.0 m
Sowing
Pits of 60 cm diameter and 30-45 cm depth
are taken. Well rotten FYM and fertilizers are
mixed with topsoil in the pit and seeds are sown
@ 4-5 per pit. Unhealthy plants are removed
after two weeks and only 3 plants are retained
per pit.
Manuring
Fertlizer dose recommended is 70:25:25 Kg
ha-1. Apply FYM @ 20-25 t ha-1 as basal dose
along with half dose of N (35 kg) and full doses
of P2O5 (25 kg) and K2O (25 kg). The remain-
ing dose of N (35 kg) can be applied in several
split doses at fortnightly intervals.
After cultivation
During the initial stages of growth,
irrigate at 3-4 days interval and alternate days
during flowering/fruiting. Irrigation at 15 mm
CPE (approximately at 3 days interval for sandy
loam soils) is more economical than irrigating
once in two days especially during summer
months for water economy. Erect pandals
when the plants start vining. Conduct weeding
and raking of the soil at the time of fertilizer
application. Earthing up is done during rainy
season.
Pests
Fruit fly (Bacterocera sp.)
In homestead gardens the fruits may be
covered with polythene, cloth or paper bags to
ensure mechanical protection. In large gardens
apply malathion 0.15 per cent suspension
containing sugar or jaggery at 10 g/l at
fortnightly intervals at flowering and fruit
initiation. Spray as coarse droplets on the
ventral surface of leaves. Remove and destroy
affected and decayed fruits. It can also be
effectively controlled by the use of banana fruit
traps coupled with the removal and destruction
of infested fruits. It is more efficient than two
sprayings with insecticides. Traps are to be set
at a distance of 2 m after a border row and
they may be replenished after 7 to 9 days. Start
bait trapping just before flowering.

PUMPKIN AND ASH GOURD
SOLANACEOUS VEGETABLES
Brinjal, chilli and tomato are the important
solanaceous fruit vegetables grown in the
state. The cultural operations of the above three
crops are similar with only slight variations.
BRINJAL (Solanum melongena)
Varieties
Surya, Swetha and Haritha (bacterial wilt
resistant open pollinated varieties), Neelima
(bacterial wilt resistant F1hybrid), Pusa Purple
Cluster and Ponny.
Seed rate : 370-500 g ha-1
Raising seedlings
Brinjal is a transplanted vegetable. Seeds
are sown in the nursery and one month old
seedlings are transplanted to the main field.
For sowing the seeds, raised seed beds of
90 to 100 cm width and convenient length are
prepared in open space with fertile
topsoil to which well decomposed organic
matter has been incorporated. Solarization of
nursery beds for 30 days prior to sowing is
effective in managing damping off disease.
After sowing the seeds, mulch with green
leaves and irrigate with a rose-can daily in the
morning. Remove the mulch immediately after
germination of the seeds. Restrict
irrigation one week before transplanting and
irrigate heavily on the previous day of
transplanting. Protray seedling can also be used.
Time of planting
For rainfed crop, transplant the seedlings
during May-June before the onset of southwest
monsoon. Planting can also be done during
September-October for irrigated crop.
Land preparation and transplanting
Land is prepared to a fine tilth by
thorough ploughing or digging. Well rotten
organic manure is incorporated in the soil and
seedlings are transplanted in shallow
trenches/pits during May or on ridges/levelled
lands during rainy season. Transplanted
seedlings may be given temporary shade for
3-4 days during summer.
Spacing
Transplant less spreading varieties like
Swetha and Surya at 60 cm x 60 cm. For
spreading varieties Haritha and Neelima,
provide wider spacing of 75-90 cm x 60 cm.
Manuring
Apply well rotten FYM / compost @
20-25 t ha-1 at the time of land preparation and
mix well with the soil. A fertilizer dose of
75:40:25 kg N:P2O5: K2O per ha may be given.
Half the dose of nitrogen, full phosphorus and
half of potash may be applied as basal dose
before transplanting. One fourth of nitrogen
and half of potash may be applied 20-30 days
after planting. The remaining quantities may
be applied two months after planting.
Application of 75:25:25 kg N:P2O5:K2O per ha
is optimum for getting maximum yield of
fruits for the variety Swetha in the reclaimed
alluvial soils of Kuttanad. However, the
economic optimum dose was found to be
60:20:25 kg of N:P2O5:K2O per ha.
After cultivation
Irrigate at three or four days interval
during summer. Stake the plants if necessary.

Anugraha.
Seed rate: 1.0 kg ha-1
Raising seedlings
Chilli is a transplanted crop. Seeds are sown
in the nursery and one month old
seedlings are transplanted to the main field.
For sowing the seeds, raised seed beds of
90 to 100 cm width and of convenient length
are prepared to which well decomposed
organic matter has been incorporated. After
sowing the seeds, mulch with green leaves and
irrigate with a rosecan daily in the morning.
Remove the mulch immediately after germi-
nation of the seeds. Restrict irrigation one week
before transplanting and irrigate heavily on the
previous day of transplanting. Protray seedlings
can also be used.
Time of planting
For a rainfed crop, transplant the seedlings
during May-June before the onset of south-
west monsoon. Planting can also be done
during September-October for an irrigated
crop.
Land preparation and transplanting
Land is prepared to a fine tilth by
thorough ploughing / digging. Well rotten
organic manure is incorporated in the soil and
seedlings are transplanted in shallow
trenches / pits during May or on ridges / level
Weeding followed by fertilizer application and
earthing up may be done at one and two months
after transplanting.
Plant protection
For avoiding damping off of the seedlings
in the nursery, sow the seeds as thin as
possible in the raised beds prepared in the open
area during summer months. Soil solarization
of nursery buds for 30 days prior to sowing
and seed treatment with Trichoderma (5 g kg-1
seed) is effective in managing the disease.
Follow mechanical removal and destruction
of pest / disease affected portions for control
of fruit and shoot borer and Phomopsis fruit
rot. Spray emamectin benzoate 5% SG @ 10g
ai ha-1 or chloran traniliprole 18.5 SC @ 30g
ai ha-1 at an interval of 15 days to control fruit
and shoot borer under large scale cultivation.
When infestations of sucking pests like
mite, jassids and white fly are severe, spray
thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 50 g ai ha-1 or
diafenthiuron 50 WP @ 300 g ai ha-1 or
spiromesifen 22.9 SC @ 96 g ai ha-1. Uproot
plants affected by little leaf and spray
insecticides for further control.
Cultivate resistant varieties like Surya,
Swetha and Haritha and the hybrid Neelima in
bacterial wilt prone areas. Soil solarization
method and Trichoderma application is also
recommended.
For managing root knot nematode,
nursery treatment with Bacillus macerans/
Paecilliomyces lilacinus @ 25 g/m2 and
mainfield treatment with P. lilacinus
@ 5g/m2 can be recommended.
In general, insecticides of plant origin may
be used, as far as possible.

POTATO (Solanum tuberosum)
Potato can be successfully cultivated in the
high ranges of Kerala. It is being
cultivated in the rain shadow areas of Idukki
district throughout the year. A day temperature
of 20-30oC is optimum for growth and
tuberisation in potato. Tuber formation is
adversely affected, if the temperature goes
above 30oC.
Season
Crops can be raised as shown below in the
eastern part of Idukki district.
Summer
:
March-April
Autumn
:
August-December
Spring
:
January-February
Varieties
Among the high yielding varieties, Kufri
Jyothi (early), Kufri Muthu (medium) and Kufri
Dewa (late) can be tried in the high ranges of
Kerala.
Soil
Loose friable sandy loam or silt loam, rich
in organic matter are ideal for potato. Hard
clay should be avoided. Optimum pH range is
5.2-7.0.
Planting
Whole potato tuber or cut pieces (50-60 g
size) longitudinally cut from bud-end to
stemend can be used for plating. For
planting 1 ha, 1000-2000 kg seed tubers are
required. Seed tubers are treated with 1 ppm
of GA 3 for one hour and then dried in shade
for getting uniform sprouting. Tubers are filled in
gunny bags after drying and kept in vertical
position in well-ventilated dark room for 10
days for encouraging sprouting. Seed pieces
should be treated with mancozeb (@ 1 kg in
450 litres of water) before planting to protect
them from soil borne diseases.Tubers can be
planted on ridges 50-60 cm wide at a spacing of
15-20 cm between the plants. Earthing up is
needed during the growing phase (30 days after
planting) and 70 days after planting.
Manuring
A basal application of FYM (20 t ha-1) is
required during field preparation. Fertilizer
recommendation is 120:100:120 kg NPK
ha-1. Apply 60 kg N, 100 kg P2O5 and 120 kg
K2O as basal. Top dressing with 60 kg N, 30
days after planting at the time of first earthing
up is essential.
Plant protection
Early blight and late blight are the
important fungal diseases. Copper fungicides
can control both diseases.
Cut worms, aphids and jassids are common
pests of potato. To control aphids and
jassids spraying dimethoate (0.05 per cent) is
effective.
ONION (Allium cepa  L.)
(Ad hoc recommendation)
Onion can be successfully cultivated in mid
lands of Kerala during October - November.
It requires a cool climate during vegetative
growth phase and a dry spell during maturity
of bulbs. Fertile and well drained soils are ideal
for cultivation. The crop will not tolerate water
logging. Open sunlight is essential for good
yield.

will be required to plant one cent (40 m2) area
in the main field.
Plough the land thoroughly, incorporate
FYM @ 20 t/ha.  Liming should be done so as
to maintain a pH range of 5.8- 6.5. Seedlings
can be transplanted in flat beds at the rate of
one seedling per hill. A spacing of 15 – 20 cm
between rows and 10 cm between plants
should be given.
 Planting on ridges or raised beds can also
be adopted to ensure good drainage.  Gap filling
if necessary may be done at 10-15 days after
planting. Weeding and hoeing may be done at
10 days intervals up to 30- 40 DAP.  A fertilizer
dose of 80:40:60   N: P2O5: K2O kg/ha may be
applied in two split doses, half N and K and
full P basally and remaining N and K at one
month after transplanting. Only light earthing
up may be done after fertilizer application.
Need based irrigation must be given.  Irrigation
should be withheld one week before harvest.
Harvesting
The crop will be ready for harvest by 3.5 - 4
months after transplanting (February –March)
when the bulbs are fully matured and 75%
leaves are dried off. The individual plants are
raked out or pulled out from the soil. The tops
are cut form the bulb leaving 2 cm length
from the bulb and dried in shade for 3-5 days.
Average yield of bulbs is 6-8 t ha-1.
Garlic requires cool and moist period
during vegetative growth and a dry spell
during maturity of the bulbs. Fertile,
well-drained loamy soils are ideal for garlic
cultivation. Heavy clay soils may result in
deformed bulbs. In high ranges of Kerala
garlic can be planted during October-
November.
Varieties: Ooty-1, G 50
Planting requirements
Cloves or bulbils are used for propagation.
For planting one hectare, 500 kg of cloves is
required. The cloves for planting should be
stored for 2-3 months after harvest and cloves
weighing 4 g are ideal for planting. The cloves
should be soaked in water followed by dipping
for 15 minutes in a solution containing 1 g of
carbendazim dissolved in 1 litre of water for
15 minutes. After drying in shade, cloves can
be used for planting. Dig the land thoroughly
and prepare beds of 15 cm height at a width of
1 m and of convenient length. The cloves should
be dibbled at a spacing of 15 cm x 8 cm.
Germination will start on the fifth day and it
will be completed within 10-15 days.

MINOR VEGETABLES AND TIPS FOR VEGETABLE SEED PRODUCTION
TIPS FOR VEGETABLE SEED PRODUCTION
General principles
The seed production programme envi-sages
to produce genetically pure quality seeds and
to store them in a viable condition for a
reasonable period of time, until it reaches the
farmers. The seeds should have genetic
purity, uniformity in size and shape, high
germination and vigour. The seeds should be
free from mechanical damages, insect and
fungal infestation and other crop and weed
seeds. A commercial seed production
programme has three aspects-seed production,
seed processing and seed storage.
a. Seed production
Important aspects of seed production are
as follows:
1. Basic knowledge on the specific require-
ment of the crop (climate, soil  requirement
etc.), specific characteristics of the

variety, pests and diseases and their
control measures are essential before
taking up the seed production programme.
2. In general, September to January is the
most suitable season for taking up seed
production in Kerala.
3. Site selected for seed production should be
open, receiving good sunlight, well drained
and fertile soil, free from infectious pest and
disease organisms.
4. Seeds for multiplication should be
obtained from reliable sources.
5. Proper isolation distance should be
maintained between varieties and related
species.
6. Scientific roguing (removal of off-types at
nursery stage, vegetative phase, flowering,
fruiting and harvest stages) should be
practiced.
7. All plants infected by diseases should be
removed from the seed production plot. No
objectionable weeds are permitted in seed
production plot.
8. In general, for most vegetable crops,
taking one or two vegetable harvests is
found ideal for economic seed production.
9. Provide one additional topdressing with N
and K2O at fruit development phase,
adequate irrigation and plant protection
measures.
10. General cultivation and plant protection
practices recommended for vegetable pro-
duction can be adopted in seed crop also.
11. Harvest the crop at optimum fruit
maturity, since immature and over
mature fruits affect the seed quality.
b. Seed processing
1. Seed processing involves extraction of
seeds from the fruits and reducing the seed
moisture content to a level of 6-8 per cent.
2.
Wet and dry methods of seed extraction
are adopted depending on the nature of the
crop. Slow drying at low temperature
(below 38ºC) is advisable rather than quick
drying at high temperature.
3.
Exposing seeds to open sunlight during
peak hours of sunshine (12 noon to 3 p.m.)
should be avoided.
4.
Spread the seeds in thin layer and give
frequent raking for aeration while
drying to avoid fungal infestation.
5.
Clean the seeds by removing inert
matter, damaged and underdeveloped
seeds etc. to get uniform quality seeds.
c. Seed storage
1.
Store seeds under cool and dry
conditions to maintain the viability.
2.
Seed moisture content of 6-8 per cent,
atmospheric temperature of 22ºC and
relative humidity of 45 per cent are the most
ideal conditions for seed storage. The sum
of storage temperature (ºC) and humidity
(per cent) should not exceed 80.
3.
Pre-storage seed treatment with fungi-
cides (captan or thiram @ 2.5 g  kg-1 of
seeds) would protect the seeds from
various fungal and insect infestations.
4.
Store the treated seeds in 700 gauge
polythene bags in sealed conditions.
Specific recommendations for seed
production of the individual crops other than
the general aspects mentioned above are
given below:
Solanaceous vegetables
Tomato
The best time for planting tomato for seed
production is October. Give an isolation
distance of 50 m for foundation seed (FS)
TIPS FOR VEGETABLE SEED PRODUCTION
204
production and 25 m for certified seed (CS)
between varieties. Rogue out off-types and
virus infected plants. Maximum off-types and
diseased plants permitted is 0.1 per cent each
only. Seeds should have a minimum purity of
98 per cent and germination of 70 per cent.
Maximum permitted inert matter content is
2 per cent, other crop seeds 0.1 per cent, weed
seeds 0.1 per cent, and maximum moisture
content 8 per cent.
Brinjal
Give an isolation distance of 200 m for FS
and 100m for CS. Remove off-types and plants
infected by little leaf disease. No
objectionable weeds are permitted in the seed
production plot. Maximum level of off-types
and plants infested by designated diseases are
0.1 per cent each. Seeds should have a
minimum purity of 98 per cent and germina-
tion of 70 per cent. Maximum inert matter
content permitted is 2 per cent, other crop
seeds 0.1 per cent, weed seeds 0.1 per cent
and maximum moisture content 8 per cent.
Chilli
Provide an isolation distance of 400 m for
FS and 200 m for CS. Remove off-types and
plants infected by virus diseases. No
objectionable weeds are permitted in the seed
production plot. Maximum level of off-types and
plants infested by designated diseases are 0.1
per cent each. Fruits of 45-50 days
maturity may be harvested for seed extraction
in the case of Jwalasakhi and Ujwala. Seeds
should have a minimum purity of 98 per cent
and germination of 70 per cent; maximum inert
matter content permitted is 2 per cent, other
crop seeds 0.1 per cent, weed seeds 0.1 per
cent and maximum moisture content 8 per cent.
Seed treatment with Trichoderma  @ 5 g/kg
seed is effective in managing seed  borne
diseases and damping off in chilli and to get
maximum germination and seedling vigour.
Okra
Provide an isolation distance of 400 m for
FS and 200 m for CS. Remove off-types and
plants infected by yellow vein mosaic disease.
No objectionable weeds are permitted in the
seed production plot. Maximum level of
off-types and plants infected by yellow vein
mosaic is 0.1 per cent each. It is economical
to take two vegetable harvests and then
retain the crop for seed production. Fruits of
36 days maturity may be harvested for seed
extraction in the case of Arka Anamika. At
this stage the pod colour completely turns to
brown and tips dry. Seeds can be stored in
polythene bags of 700 gauge thickness. Seeds
should have a minimum purity of 99 per cent
and germination of 65 per cent. Maximum
inert matter content permitted is 1 per cent; no
seeds of other crops or weeds are
permitted and maximum moisture content
permitted for open storage is 10 per cent and
for storing in moisture proof containers is
8 per cent.
Cucurbits
General
An isolation distance of 800 m for FS and
400 m for CS is required between varieties
and related species. Remove off-types, wild
cucurbits and plants infected by designated
diseases. No objectionable weeds are
permitted in the seed production plot.
Maximum level of off-types and plants
infected by yellow vein mosaic diseases is 0.1
per cent each. Seeds should have a minimum
purity of 99 per cent and germination of 60 per
cent. Maximum inert matter content permit-
ted is 1 per cent. No seeds of other crops or
weeds are permitted and maximum moisture
content should not exceed 7 per cent.
205
TIPS FOR VEGETABLE SEED PRODUCTION
Bitter gourd
Taking two vegetable harvests and then
leaving the crop for seed production is
economical. Fruits of Preethi variety should
be harvested 21-24 days after anthesis to get
maximum recovery of good quality  seeds. At
this stage, lower one third of fruit turns
yellow. Ripe fruits of 24 days maturity in
Preethi, when the whole fruits turn to bright
orange colour, can be harvested for seed
extraction. Seeds may be dried in the sun,
avoiding peak sunshine hours of 12 noon to
3 p.m. Seeds can be stored in 700 gauge thick
polythene bags. Soaking seeds for 3 hours in
1:10  solution of  150 ppm KNO3 increases
seed germination and seedling vigour.
Snake gourd
Fruits can be harvested for seed extraction
36 days after anthesis (Harithasree), when
yellowing of fruits start from the stylar end.
Big and medium sized fruits (above 85 cm
length and 2 kg weight in Kaumudi) give
maximum quantity of quality seeds.
Oriental pickling melon
Harvest fully ripe fruits with deep orange
colour (30 days after anthesis in Mudicode),
when the vines wither. Select big and medium
sized fruits (above 1.25 kg in Mudicode) for
quality seeds.
Machine extraction (without fermentation
of pulp) and drying under shade for one day
and then in sun avoiding peak hours
(12 noon to 3.00 pm) to 8 per cent moisture
gives good quality seeds.
Ash gourd
Ash gourd fruits of 70 days maturity
after anthesis are suitable for seed extraction.
At this stage the vines wither and the sticky
thick ashy coating on the fruits dries into white
powder, which can be removed on
rubbing. Fruits of medium and large size (above
5 kg in KAU Local) give bolder, quality seeds.
It is advisable to have a post-harvest storage
of fruits for three months to get higher
germination.
Manual extraction of pulp from the fruits
and fermenting the pulp for 48 hours is
better to get quality seeds without mechanical
damage.
Acid treatment of pulp using 2 per cent HCI
(1:10) for 30 minutes followed by
drying under shade to 8 per cent moisture also
gives good quality seeds.
 Pre-storage treatment of seeds with
captan @ 2.5 g kg-1 and storing in sealed
polythene bags of 700 gauge thickness is the
best for seed storage.
Water melon
Manual extraction with acid treatment
using 1 per cent HCl (1:10) for 30 minutes
and drying under shade for one day and
then in sun, avoiding peak hours (12 noon to
3.00 p.m) to 8 per cent moisture gives good
quality seeds.
Vegetable cowpea
Dried pods can be harvested for seed
purpose. These pods are further dried in the
sun before seed extraction. Good drying and
pre-storage seed treatment of seeds is essen-
tial to protect them from Bruchus and fungal
infestations.
Amaranth
It is economical to take one vegetable
harvest at 30 days after planting and then
leaving the crop for seed production.

when farm yard manure is used as the organic
source. The  recommended dose for single
sucker itself is sufficient with vermicompost
as organic source. This should be accompanied
with in situ green manuring @ 15 g cowpea
seeds per pit (25 kg ha-1) at the time of planting.
Incorporate the cowpea crop into soil 40 days
after sowing.
Plant crop followed by two ratoon crops
gives maximum yield. Two suckers per clump
should be retained for ratooning.

entire fertilizers have to be applied in a single
dose immediately after the harvest of the
preceding crop. Irrigate immediately after
manuring.
Note: For Nendran, apply the fertilizers in six
split doses as detailed below which will
be beneficial to improve the finger size
and bunch weight, provided the farmers
can afford the cost of application.
In Onattukara, for Njalipoovan, apply N,
P2O5 and K2O @ 200:200:400g/plant/year in
two equal split doses: the first,  two months
after planting and the second, four months after
planting.
For Palayankodan (rainfed), planting may
209
BANANA
be done in January and the suckers may be
given pot irrigation @ 9 litres of water once in
15 days until April-May.
After planting banana, sow sun hemp /
daincha / cowpea adopting a seed rate of
50 kg ha-1. Incorporate the crop into the soil
40 days after sowing. Repeat sowing of green
manure crop and incorporate into soil 40 days
after sowing.
Incorporation of cowpea in the inter-spaces
of banana cv. Nendran with 75 per cent
recommended dose of fertilizer (143:85:225 g
N: P2O5: K2O /plant) can be done as INM
practice for highest BC ratio.
Irrigation
1. During summer months, irrigate once in
three days.
2. Ensure good drainage and prevent water
logging.
3. About 6-10 irrigations per crop may be
given depending upon soil conditions.
4. Banana var. Nendran (October planting)
grown under deep water table conditions
(below 2 m from ground level) needs
10 mm (40 l/plant) irrigation once in two
days during summer season to ensure higher
bunch yield and better water use efficiency.
Mulching the basin with 3.5 kg paddy straw
(waste quality) will considerably improve
the bunch yield.
Weed control
During early stages, complete control of
weeds could be obtained by raising cowpea in
the interspaces. In gardens where this is not
possible, pre-emergence application of diuron
1.5 kg ha-1 or oxyfluorfen 0.2 kg ha-1 is
effective. Weeds emerging later could be
controlled by the application of glyphosate 0.4
kg ha-1. If hand weeding is resorted to,
give 4-5 surface diggings depending on weed
growth. Avoid deep digging. Do not disturb soil
after plants start producing bunches.
If green manure crop is grown, weeding
operations can be reduced to 1-2 diggings.
Desuckering
Remove side suckers produced till the
emergence of bunch. Retain one or two
suckers produced after the emergence of
bunch.
Intercropping in Nendran variety
Cucumber and amaranth can be cultivated
profitably with banana raised in September-
October without affecting the bunch weight.
For vegetable purpose, cucumber may be
harvested within 95 days and for seed
purpose the duration may be about 130 days.
Greater yam and elephant foot yam can be
profitably intercropped with Nendran.
Pre harvest bunch spray
Pre harvest bunch sprays of 3 per cent
K2SO4 (3 g in 100 ml of distilled water) twice,
the first two weeks after bunch emergence
and the second four weeks after bunch
emergence increases the fruit yield
substantially and consumer preferences in
Nendran banana.
Tissue culture Nendran banana
(Ad hoc recommendation)
Tissue culture offers a rapid method of
multiplication of quality, uniform, pest and
disease free production of planting materials
in large quantities in banana. The productivity
of banana can be increased by cultivation of
tissue culture plants of selected elite ecotypes
of different varieties.
Spacing
Give spacing of 2 m x 2 m (2500 plants/
ha). Tissue culture plants can also be used for
high density planting in Nendran banana to
achieve higher returns.The spacing
recommended for high density planting is
as follows: (a) 2 m x 3 m with two plants / pit
BANANA
210
(3332 plants in 1666 pits per ha) (b) 1.75 m x
1.75 m with one plant per pit (3265 plants / ha).
Pit size
50 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm
Method of planting
Prepare pits 15 days in advance of
planting. Fill the pits with topsoil and FYM 15-
20 kg per plant per pit. Plant the tissue culture
plants on the top of the pit at ground level.
Remove the polythene cover completely before
planting without damaging the roots. Planting
may be done preferably during evening hours.
Provide partial shade to plants to protect
against sun scorching for about two weeks.
Irrigate the crop daily during initial days of
establishment.
Plant protection
Adopt integrated plant protection
measures to control major pests and diseases.
Manures and Fertilizers

Pests
Banana pseudostem weevil
The weevils resemble the rhizome
weevil. Adult female weevil punctures and
inserts eggs into the pseudostem. Grubs
emerging out feed extensively on the
pseudostem and thereby the entire plant
collapses.
Management
1. Field sanitation is the most important
factor in the prophylactic and curative
control of this pest.

2. Remove affected plants along with the
rhizome in full and destroy them by
burning the life stages of the insect using
kerosene or by burying the material in deep
pits in soil.
3. Destroy the parts of rhizome and
pseudostem of harvested plants in the field
as described above.
4. Remove the dry outer sheaths of the
pseudostem of all infested and un-infested
plants in the endemic areas and spray any
of the recommended insecticides.
Drenching all the leaf axils, rhizome and
surrounding soil and all round the entire
pseudostem inserting the nozzle through the
bore holes made by the larvae if any and
also within the outer sheathes by slightly
raising the same at different spots is also
effective. Apply quinalphos 0.05 per cent
or chlorpyrifos 0.03 per cent. Repeat the
treatment after 3 weeks if the infestation
persists.
Banana rhizome weevil
The attack by this pest is reported to be
serious in all localities where banana is
cultivated. Female adults puncture healthy
rhizomes and insert eggs through it. Grubs
tunnel into the rhizome and feed on it
resulting in the stunting of rhizome. If the
infestation occurs on a mature rhizome,
damage symptoms such as   reduction in leaf
number, bunch size and the fruit number
appear.
Management
1. Adopt strict field sanitation.
2. Select only healthy planting material.
3. Deep ploughing of the land so as to
expose the inner soil layer to sun.
4. Cut and remove the outer layer of the
rhizome and sundry for 3-4 days after
smearing it with slurry of cowdung and ash.
5. Set traps using pseudostem of approxi
mately 0.5 m length, which are split
lengthwise and laid in the field. Adults
attracted to it during nights may be collected
and destroyed.
6. Application of Thiamethoxam 25 WG 0.2
g/l or 1g/5 l or Fipronil 0.3 G 10 g formulation /
plant at planting followed by two
applications 2 and 5 months after planting.
7. Sucker treatment with Pseudomonas
fluorescens @ 20 g/l + Sucker treatment
with entomopathogenic nematode,
Heterorhabditis bacteriophora @ 4 infected
wax moth larvae/plant at planting followed
by two applications 2 and 5 months after
planting.
Aphid
Act as vector for the transmission of the
dreadful bunchy top disease in banana.
Spindle leaf miner
Spray dimethoate 0.05 per cent on the
spindle for controlling the leaf miner.
Nematodes
Major species are burrowing nematode,
root knot nematode, root lesion nematode and
cyst nematode.
In case of severe infestation there will be
severe reduction in  number of leaves, total
bunch weight and  number of fruits.
Management
Pare the rhizomes and apply neem
cake @ 1 kg/plant at the time of  planting.
For managing nematodes paring+ banana
sucker treatment with Bacillus macerans/
Paecilomyces lilacinus @ 5g/sucker + pit

BANANA
212
Management
1. Eradicate disease affected plants.
2. Use disease free suckers for planting.
Karpooravally, Kanchikela, Njalipoovan and
Koompillakannan are less susceptible
varieties.
3. Use of virus indexed tissue culture plants.
Panama wilt (Fusarium wilt) (Fusarium
oxysporum f. cubense)
1. Dip suckers of susceptible varieties in
2 g l
-1 carbendazim solution to prevent
spread of the disease.
2. Drench the soil around affected clumps with
2 g l
-1 carbendazim solution to prevent
spread of disease.
3. Remove and destroy affected clumps along
with corms.
4. Apply lime @ 1 kg pit-1 and allow to
weather. Varieties such as Palayankodan,
Robusta and Nendran are resistant to the
disease.
Sigatoka leaf spot (Mycosphaerella sp.)
1. Cut and burn all severely affected leaves.
2. Spray 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture with
sticker soon after the appearance of the
initial symptoms of the disease. The disease
appears with the commencement of
southwest monsoon. Five to six sprayings
at fortnightly intervals are to be given
depending upon the severity of the
disease.
3. Petroleum based mineral oil 1 per cent
emulsion is also effective in controlling the
disease.
4. Spray carbendazim 1 g l-1 or give
alternate sprays of mancozeb (2 g l-1) and
carbendazim (1 g l-1) soon after the
appearance of initial symptoms of the
disease. Three to four sprays at fortnightly
intervals are to be given depending on the
severity of disease.
5. Spraying of cow’s urine (10%) / sucker
treatment with Pseudomonas fluore scens
5% + Spraying 2% Pseudomonas
fluorescens and vegetable oil ( 2.5 ml l-1) +
baking soda (2.5g l-1).
Kokkan disease (Banana bract mosaic virus)
Kokkan disease  was found to affect other
varieties like Palayankodan, Kodappanilla-
kunnan, Monthan, Kanchikela, Poovan
(Rasthali), Karpooravally, Chenkadali and
Nendran. Nendran is a highly susceptible
variety.
During the young stage of Nendran
banana plant (two months old), pinkish streaks
can be seen on the pseudostem. All the kokkan
affected plants may not show  this symptom.
Necrotic streaks are another important
symptom of the disease. The streaks are
initially brown, which later turn black. It occurs
on all aerial parts of the affected plant except
on lamina, the length being a few mm to 10
cm. All the kokkan-affected plants will exhibit
the necrotic streaks from third month onwards
at one stage or other. Some of the affected
plants retain the necrotic streaks throughout
the growth period. In certain cases it disappears
with the senescence of the affected portion.
Leaves of the infected plants also show
travellers palm like leaf arrangements.
The affected plant produces only a small
bunch. The fingers are small, curved and
widely divergent with pale green to ashy green
colour as compared to. healthy ones. The
abnormal colour and reduction in the size of
bunch depend upon the severity of the disease.
Suckers should not be taken from
affected plants, which show necrotic streaks
or abnormal colour of the pseudostem.When
the young plants show the symptom of
pinkish streaks, they should be uprooted and
destroyed.
213
BANANA
Infectious chlorosis (Cucumber mosaic
virus disease)
The disease is noticed in varieties such as
Nendran, Palayankodan, Karpooravally,
Kosthabontha, Peykunnan, Bhimkhel,
Mottapoovan, Dakshinsagar, Madhuraga,
Rasthali and Musa ornata.
The most characteristic symptoms are the
loss of leaf colour in patches, appearance of
parallel chlorotic streaks on the younger leaves
giving a striped appearance of the leaves. As
the disease progresses, leaves emerge
distorted, margins become irregularly wavy,
often with blotches of necrotic tissues and the
lamina is reduced in width. In severe cases,
rotted areas are found throughout the leaf
sheath and pseudostem. The affected plants
produce only small bunches. This is a virus
disease transmitted by aphids.
1. Use disease free suckers for planting.
2. Eradicate disease affected plants.
3. Avoid growing leguminous and cucurbi-
taceous vegetables as intercrop in banana
in disease prone areas.
Banana streak disease
Banana streak disease is caused by Banana
streak badna virus and transmitted by
pineapple mealy bug (Dysmicoccus brevipes
Cockerell) and striped mealy bug (Ferrisia
virgata Cockerell). It is predominant on
Palayankodan variety, also noticed on other
varieties like Nendran, Chinali and
Mottapoovan. The symptoms appear on
different parts of the plant such as leaf lamina,
midrib, pseudostem and on bunches. Linear
chlorotic streaks appear  on  leaf lamina which
later turned brown streaks. Such dark brown
linear lesions appear on petiole, midrib,
pseudostem and bunches. Under severe
conditions, necrosis and death of cigar leaf  is
noticed and such plants fail to flower and lead
to total yield loss.
For the control of the disease, eradicate
diseased plants, do not select planting materials
from infected clumps. Avoid growing colocasia
as intercrop and control of  mealy bug vectors.
Process Protocol for Banana flour
production
The banana powder is prepared by drying
banana slices at 70oC for 24 h, which was pre-
treated with 0.5% citric acid for 10 min, in a
convective dryer. An ethnic health mix was
also developed out of Nendran banana flour
and sugar (75:25). The best proportion of
Nendran banana flour and sugar were
selected based on the nutritional and sensory
quality parameters. The new product could be
stored for more than six months using suitable
packaging technology.
RTE Snacks from starch based food
products
An extruded Ready To Eat (RTE) snack
food product was developed out of starch
based food products such as rice, cassava and
Nendran banana at optimized process
parameters viz; temperature (180oC), screw
speed (100 rpm) and moisture content (16%)
using a single screw exruder. The best
proportion of rice: banana and cassava
(10:80:10) was selected based on the
nutritional, engineering, textural and sensory
quality parameters. The new RTE product
could be stored for more than six months using
suitable packaging technology.

GUAVA (Psidium guajava)
Guava thrives well in places receiving
medium rainfall not exceeding 100 cm. In
heavy rainfall areas, plants grow luxuriantly,
but produce insipid and low quality friuts.
It grows well on any type of soil. Red sandy
loam soil with good drainage is the most ideal
for commercial cultivation of guava.
Varieties
Allahabad Safeda, Sardar (Lucknow-49),
Red Fleshed, Apple Coloured and Pear Shaped.
Planting material
Air layering is widely adopted for
propagation of selected varieties. Layers strike
roots within 3-5 weeks. When the roots grow
through the ball of moss, the stem may be
severed below the girdled area in stages. The
polythene film is removed from the
finally severed rooted stem, which is then
potted and kept in the shade until new leaves
appear. When the new flushes are produced,
the plant can be hardened in full sunlight
preparatory to transplanting in the field.
Planting
Pits of one metre cube are made 6 m apart.
Fill the pits with topsoil, sand and cowdung.
Layers are planted in the centre of the pit.
Staking of plants is also done, if necessary.
After planting, mulching with dry leaves should
be done to conserve moisture. June-July is the
ideal time for planting. Plants should be irrigated
in summer. Square system of planting
facilitates easy orchard operations. Guava can
be grown as an intercrop in coconut gardens.
Manuring
A fully grown-up bearing plant should be
manured with about 80 kg of FYM, 200 g N,
80 g P2O5 and 260 g K2O. These may be
applied in two or three split doses when there
is sufficient moisture in the soil.
Yield
Guava layers start bearing from 3-4 years
after planting. About 500-800 fruits per year
can be obtained from a 10 year old tree.
Plant protection
Fruit rot disease
This is a serious disease of guava especially
during rainy season. The symptoms are
manifested as development of dark brown
circular spots at the blossom end of the
immature green fruits.
Guava wilt
In affected trees, the branches wither and
die one after another and in a few weeks or
months the tree, which seemed entirely healthy
will be dead. Remove such trees as soon as
the symptoms are identified to prevent the
spread of the disease.
Fruit fly
This is a serious pest of guava. The insect
affects the fruit when it matures. The infested
fruits show depression with dark green
punctures. As a precautionary measure, the
crop should be sprayed just before fruit
maturity with dimethoate (0.05 per cent).
215
GUAVA
INDIAN GOOSEBERRY (Phyllanthus emblica)
Indian Gooseberry/Emblica/Nelli is quite
hardy and can be grown with little care in all
types of soil except very sandy type. It
prefers a warm dry climate and is found in the
dry deciduous forests of Kerala.
Varieties
Much genetic variability exists in this
species. However, a high yielding larger fruited
variety was located from the rain shadow
region of the Western Ghats and popularized
as “Chambakad Large”. Other varieties are
Banarasi, Krishna and Kanchan.
Cultivation
Emblica is usually propagated by seeds and
vegetatively by wedge grafting. The seeds are
enclosed in a hard seed coat, which renders
the germination difficult. The seeds can be
extracted by sun drying ripe fruits  for about
2-3 days till they split open releasing the seeds.
The seeds can be directly sown. Gooseberry
can be vegetatively propagated through root
suckers also.
One year old seedlings can be planted in
the field during rainy season at a spacing of 8
m x 8 m. It can be planted as windbreak around
the orchard.
No serious pests or diseases are
generally found in this crop.
Harvesting
Seedlings will commence bearing from the
10
th year and the grafts in 3-4 years. The
vegetative growth of the tree continues from
April to July. Along with the new growth in the
spring, flowering  commences. Fruits will
mature by January-February. Yield ranges
between 30-50 kg per tree per year when full
grown.
JACK (Artocarpus heterophyllus)
Jack comes up well in humid regions up to
an elevation of 1000 m. Soil should be deep
and well drained. Any rise in water table or
poor aeration of the soil is detrimental to the
crop.
Varieties / types
Jackfruit differs in size, shape and
quality. The jackfruit may be classified into two
groups: (i) soft fleshed (koozha) and (ii) firm
fleshed (varikka).The firm fleshed type is
highly tasty, sweet and crisp. The two groups
are further classified depending on the taste,
size of fruit, odour of flesh and also the  nature,
shape and diversity of prickles on the rind.
Two distinct types with desirable
qualities recommended for Kerala are:
1. Muttom varikka which is a firm fleshed,
sweet scented variety.
2. Singapore or Srilanka jack which is an
introduced variety from Srilanka. It bears
fruits in 3 years after planting and is
extremely precocious in habit. The fruits
are more or less the same size as the
common jack fruit. A tree may yield as many
as 250 fruits.
3. Sindhoor - Higly sweet variety with
attractive sunset orange coloured flakes.
Bear medium sized fruits (11-12 kg) twice
a year.
Planting materials
Use grafts for planting. For grafting, raise
INDIAN GOOSEBERRY AND JACK
216
seedlings in polythene bags and when they are
9-12 months old, do inarching. One month after
grafting, behead the rootstock above the graft
joint.
Epicotyl grafting can be undertaken
successfully in jack. Three to four month old,
10 cm long scions are grafted on five days old
rootstocks in polythene bags by the cleft method
during the month of June and keep under moist
conditions. The scions should be pre-cured 10
days before grafting by clipping the leaf blades
and keeping the petioles intact on the twig. The
graft union establishes by 80 days after grafting
operations.
A new method of approach grafting utilizing
sprouted jack seedlings (maximum 20 days old)
as root stock and tender shoot tips of 2 to 3
weeks old with one or two tender leaves as
scion  is successful, fast and cost affective.
Season
Plant one year old grafts at the onset of
monsoon showers.
Planting
Prepare pits of size 60 cm x 60 cm x
60 cm at a spacing of 12-15 m. Fill pits with
mixture of topsoil and 10 kg compost or FYM
per pit to a level higher than the adjoining
ground. Plant the grafts in the same depth as
they were in the containers, preferably in the
late evening. Deep planting results in poor
growth of the graft. Ensure that the graft joint
is above the soil level. Stake the plants to
prevent snapping at the graft joints. Excellent
drainage and adequate watering result in better
performance. At no stage it should be exposed
to drought or frost. It is useful to provide some
protection, especially to young trees. Jack is
rarely manured. Even without fertilizer
application, the jack trees come up well under
Kerala conditions.
Harvesting
The seedlings generally bear after eight
years and the grafted plants after three years
of planting. The fruiting season lasts about four
months from January-February to May-June.
The average yield from one tree is about
50-100 fruits per year.
Plant protection
The important pests of jack are
shoot borer caterpillar, mealy bug and jack
scale.
The common diseases that attack the tree
are the pink disease, stem rot and fruit rot.
Pruning of affected plants and protecting
the cut ends with Bordeaux paste are
recommended against these diseases.
Ready to cook tender jack fruit
A process protocol developed for canning
of tender jack fruit involves treatment
combinations like blanching process, thermal
processing parameters viz; time, temperature
and preservatives were optimized based on the
quality analysis and shelf life studies.  The
study concluded that the samples which were
blanched for one minute at 100oC and
pasteurized at 90oC for F value 10 were found
to be superior. A shelf life of 2 years could be
achieved for pasteurised and sterilised tender
jack fruit at refrigerated storage and ambient
condition respectively, using this new
technology. The product resembled the fresh
sample, available to the consumers in a ready
to cook form throughout the year.

JACK
MANDARIN ORANGE (Citrus reticulata)
Mandarin orange is a subtropical fruit
growing in the high ranges of Kerala. It
requires deep soil rich in humus. The crop
cannot withstand waterlogging. It is grown in
regions having good drainage.
Preparation of land
Dig pits of size 70 cm x 60 cm x 70 cm at a
spacing of 7-8 m at least one month in
advance of planting.
Planting material
Use budded plants for planting. For
raising seedlings, extract seeds from selected
fruits by squeezing. Wash the seeds free of
pulp and dry them. Make seedbeds 1.5 m long,
1 m wide and 15 cm height. Sow the seeds
giving a spacing of 13 cm in a row and 3 cm
between the rows. Thin the seedlings if
necessary or plant selected seedlings in
secondary nursery. For budding, use rough
lemon (jambhiri) seedlings as rootstock. Raise
the rootstock seedlings in a nursery and when
they are 18-24 months old, budding may be
done by the inverted “T” method. The best
time for budding is from July to September. A
month after insertion, lop off the vegetative
growth of the seedling above the bud joint
completely. The budded plants are ready for
planting in 6-12 months.
Time and method for planting
Planting is done during July-August. Lift the
plants carefully with a ball of earth around the
roots and plant them carefully without
disturbing the roots. While planting, remove the
bandage around the bud joint and keep the bud
joint at least 10-15 cm above soil surface.
Remove the vegetative growth arising below
the bud union periodically.
Manuring
The manuring schedule recommended is
given below.
Apply organic manure in May and
fertilizers in two equal split doses during June-
July and in September-October. In addition to
the above manures and fertilizers, spray
micronutrients such as zinc sulphate 500 g,
copper sulphate 500 g, manganese sulphate
300 g and lime 500 g in 100 litres of water per
ha twice in a year during March and October-
November.
After cultivation
Give a light digging or ploughing when the
rains start.
Pruning
In the early stages, give some formative
pruning to establish a strong framework.
Remove all shoots arising from rootstock
below the bud union. Remove dead branches
and smear the cut ends with Bordeaux paste.
Do not prune the roots.
Intercropping
Crops like coffee, cardamom, banana and
pineapple can be planted as intercrops
depending on soil fertility status.

Chloridolum sp. and Nupserha sp.) cause
withering of branches. Gum exudes from holes
on stems and branches. Accumulation of wood
dust on ground around the base is another
symptom of borer damage.
Cutting and burning of the affected
branches and injecting petrol during May is
recommended against the borers.
Among diseases, dieback, root and
collar rot are important. Periodical removal of
dried twigs and application of Bordeaux paste
on cut ends and application of Bordeaux
mixture 1  per cent can control dieback disease.
Against root and collar rot, removal of soil
from the base of the trunk, scraping of the dead
bark and application of lime sulphur
are to be done. As an alternative, smear
Bordeaux paste over the treated roots and
stem. Exposing the main roots to a depth of
about 30 cm is also advised.
MANGO (Mangifera indica)
Mango is adaptable to a wide range of
climate and soil conditions and grows well from
sea level up to about 1500 m above mean sea
level. It withstands both fairly dry
conditions and heavy rainfall.
Varieties
Alphonso, Kalapady, Neelum, Mundappa,
Pairi, Baneshan, Alampur Baneshan, Mulgoa,
Suvarnarekha, Bangalora, Bennet Alphonso
(Sindhuram), Prior (Priyur), Muvandan,
Vellaikolamban (Kolambu mavu), Chandra-
karan (Juicy/suitable for tender mango pickle).
Hybrids
Hybrid No.45 (Bennet Alphonso x
Himayuddin), Hybrid No.87 (Kalapady x
Alampur Baneshan), Hybrid No.151
(Kalapady x Neelum),  Ratna.
Season
Plant one year old grafts with the onset of
monsoon showers so that they get established
before the rains. If rainfall is heavy, planting
should be done during August-September.
Vegetative propagation
Stone grafting is successful in mango.
August is ideal for the operation. Select four
month old scion materials. Defoliation of scion
shoots 10 days prior to grafting is
beneficial. Grafting of 8 cm long scion on
rootstocks at a height of 6 to 8 cm is most
successful. The dieback disease of grafts
caused by Colletotrichum can be controlled
by spraying 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture.
Planting
Select good grafts for planting. Planting can
be done in square system or hexagonal
system. Prepare pits of size 1 m x 1 m x 1 m at
a spacing of 9 m, one month before
planting and allow to weather. Refill pits with
mixture of topsoil and 10 kg of compost or
FYM per pit to a level higher than the adjoining
ground. Plant the grafts at the same depths as
they were in the containers, preferably in the
late evening. Deep planting results in poor
growth of the plant. Ensure that the graft joint
is above the soil level. Tie the plants to stakes
219
MANDARIN ORANGE AND MANGO
to prevent snapping at the graft joints.
Manuring
Apply FYM/compost and fertilizers at the
rate indicated below:
ii) Keep the soil moist by watering at an
interval of 15-20 days.
iii) Proper management practices should be
followed to maintain the health of the
trees.
After cultivation
Base banding technique for Loranthus
management: To manage the mistletoes in
mangoes, base banding with a strip of cotton
cloth (20cm long, 1cm width) soaked in 2%
2,4-D on a fresh wound, either on the root
system or lower most portion of the parasite
stem will be effective.
Irrigate twice a week during summer
months till the plants are 4-5 years old. Grow
vegetables, horse gram, black gram,
pineapple and banana as intercrops in young
orchards. Carry out intercultural operations by
ploughing or digging twice during the year in
June and October. For reducing fruit
drop and to improve productivity, NAA at
10-30 ppm concentration may be sprayed to
the entire inflorescence at the peak stage in
the second week after fruit set.
Plant protection

The important pests of mango are
hoppers, stem borers, shoot midges, leaf
feeding insects, fruit flies and psyllids. The
common diseases are the powdery mildew,
anthracnose and dieback. To control mango
hopper spray malathion 0.1 per cent at the time
of flowering. To control mango stem borer,
apply paste made of crude carbolic acid (130
ml), soft soap (1 kg) and hot water (3.7 litres)
Green leaves (25 kg/plant) and wood ash
(10-15 kg/plant) may be applied additionally.
Apply organic manures in May-June with
the onset of monsoon. Apply the fertilizers in
one dose during May-June until bearing stage
and thereafter in two equal split doses,
the first during May-June and the second during
August-September. Apply manures and
fertilizers in trenches 30 cm deep taken at a
distance of 2.5 to 3 m from the base
of the tree.

for 15 minutes is recommended.
To control shoot midge, which causes the
drying of tender shoots, spray dimethoate 0.05
per cent. Apply wettable sulphur for the
control of powdery mildew. To control dieback
of twigs and branches,cut the affected twigs
below the infected region and apply Bordeaux
paste to the cut ends.
PAPAYA (Carica papaya)
Papaya thrives well in tropical climate. The
occurrence of low temperature and frost limits
its cultivation. The optimum temperature for
the growth and development of papaya is 22-
26ºC. In Kerala, the limiting factors for
commercial cultivation are high rainfall and
severe drought in summer. However, this is
best suited as a homestead fruit crop. The
papaya prefers a rich, well-drained soil. It will
not tolerate waterlogging around the trunk.
Varieties
Washington, Honey Dew, Coorg Honey
Dew, Solo, Pusa Dwarf, Surya, Co-7, Pusa
Nanha, Pusa Giant; Co-2 and Co-5 are
suitable for papain extraction.
Propagation
Papaya is propagated almost entirely by
seeds. The best time for raising papaya
seedlings is from February to March. The
seeds are sown in raised seedbeds of 2 m x
1 m made 15 cm above the ground level or in
polythene bags. A mixture of sand, leaf mould
and dried FYM is spread over the seedbed.
The seeds are sown 2-3 cm deep at a distance
of 5 cm in rows 15 cm apart. To raise seedlings
for planting in a hectare, 250 g seeds are
required. Seed beds should be watered daily,
if there is no rain.
Papaya seedlings raised in polythene bags
can stand transplanting better than that raised
in seedbeds. Polythene bags of 20 cm x 15 cm
size and 150 gauge thickness are used as
containers. They are filled with a mixture of
FYM, soil and sand in equal proportions.
Two seeds are sown in each bag and after
germination, only one seedling is retained.
Vegetative propagation by mound layering is
also possible.
Planting
Two months old seedlings are transplanted
in the main field in May-June at a spacing of 2
m x 2 m. Pits of size 50 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm
are taken and filled with topsoil. Male plants
are removed as soon as they flower and the
female and hermaphrodite plants are
retained. In pure female plantations, one male
plant is retained for every 10 female plants.
Seedlings are shaded to protect them from
221
MANGO AND PAPPAYA
excessive sunlight until they establish. In
hermaphrodite or monoecious types male plants
may not be required.
Manuring
Organic manure may be applied @10 to
25 kg/plant/year at the onset of southwest
monsoon in basins around the plant. Each
papaya plant should also be supplied with
40 g N, 40 g P2O5 and 80 g K2O at bimonthly
interval.
Intercultivation and intercropping
Keep the papaya plot free of weeds. Two
hand diggings, one in the beginning of
the rainy season and another in January-
February are necessary. When papaya is grown
as the main crop, vegetables can be profitably
cultivated as intercrop for about six months
from planting of papaya seedlings.
Irrigation
The crop should be irrigated in summer. The
ring system of irrigation is better for
papaya than the basin system because the ring
system prevents irrigation water coming into
contact with the stem, thus preventing collar
rot.
Harvesting
The seedlings flower and set fruit
within 3-5 months after transplanting. The
number of fruits harvested per tree per year
varies from 25 to 30. Fruits showing
streaks of yellow colour are harvested.
Although papaya trees bear flowers and
fruits continuously for many years, it is
not economical to retain the trees after
2.5 to 3 years.
Extraction of papain
Papain is an active enzyme present in the
latex or milky secretion of papaya plants and
immature fruits. Half to three-fourth matured
fruits (about 70 to 100 days from fruit set) are
preferred for papain extraction. Tapping of
fruits can be done early in the morning by giving
longitudinal skin depth incisions (3 mm) on the
surface of the fruits from the stalk end to tip.
Stainless steel blades or knives or bamboo
splinters are used for incising papaya fruits.
The milky latex is collected in arecanut spathes
or aluminium or glass vessels. The incisions
are repeated in two or three subsequent
occasions at 3 to 4 days intervals. The latex
collected in this way is dried in the sun or in an
artificial drier at 50-55oC. A small quantity of
potassium metabisulphite is added to the
liquid latex to extend the storage life of
papain. The dried latex can be stored in
airtight polythene or glass containers for a
period of six months. Tapped fruits are equally
tasty as untapped fruits, although impaired in
appearance.
Plant protection
Papaya mealy bug
Bio-control of papaya mealy bug using
parasitoid - See page 332.
Damping off
It causes rotting of seedlings in the
nursery. This can be prevented by sterilizing
the soil of the seedbed with 2.5 per cent
formaldehyde solution and covering it for 48
hours with polythene sheets. This treatment is
given 15 days before sowing.
Collar rot or stem rot
Waterlogging and poor drainage are
the chief contributing factors. Application of
Bordeaux paste on the stem and soil
drenching with Bordeaux mixture 1 per cent
are control measures.
Anthracnose
It causes premature fruit fall and leaf
fall. To control, spray 1% Bordeaux mixture.
Papaya mosaic and papaya leaf curl are two
serious virus diseases of papaya. Remove the
affected plants and burn them immediately.
PAPPAYA
222
Pineapple is mostly grown at low
elevations in areas with a temperature
range of 15 to 30ºC. Pineapple is tolerant
to drought because of the special water
storage cells. They can be grown with a
wide range of rainfall from 600-2500 mm/
annum, the optimum being 1000-1500 mm.
Pineapple can be grown in a wide range of
soils, but does not tolerate waterlogging. It can
be grown as a pure crop on plantation scale or
as an intercrop in coconut gardens.
Season
The planting season is May-June.
Planting should be avoided during the
periods of heavy rains.
Varieties
There are three varieties viz., Kew, Amritha
and Mauritius.
1. KEW
Kew is a variety recommended for
large scale commercial cultivation in Kerala.
The Package of Practices recommendations
for its cultivation is detailed below.
Preparation of the land
Prepare the land for planting by
ploughing or digging followed by levelling.
Depending on the nature of land, prepare
trenches of convenient length and about
90 cm width and 15-30 cm depth. The trenches
are to be aligned at a distance of 165 cm from
centre to centre.
Selection and treatment of suckers
Select healthy suckers of uniform size
weighing 500-1000 g. Keep suckers in open
space under shade in a single layer for about 7
days for drying. Strip off a few lower old dried
leaves. Allow the suckers to dry and cure for
PINEAPPLE (Ananas comosus)
another 7 days. Dip the cured suckers in 1per
cent Bordeaux mixture at the time of planting.
Planting
Rake the soil and plant the suckers in double
rows at spacing of 45 cm x 30 cm.
 Limit the depth of planting to 7.5 to 10 cm.
Adopt triangular method of planting in each
trench so that the plants in two adjacent rows
are not opposite to each other (plant population
40400 / ha).
Manuring
Apply compost / cattle manure at 25 t ha-1
as basal dressing. Apply fertilizers at the
following dosage:
Dose
N:P2O5:K2O
Per plant per year (g)
8:4:8
Per hectare per year (kg)
320:160:320
Apply full dose of P2O5 at the time of
planting. Nitrogen and K2O may be applied in
four splits, during May-June (at planting),
August-September, November and May-June
(2nd year).
Note: In places where rains are scanty
during November, N and K2O may be
applied in three equal splits - two doses in 1st
year (May-June and August-September) and
the third in May-June of the second year. After
application of fertilizers, cover with soil by
scraping the sides of trenches.
Irrigation
During summer months, pineapple should
be irrigated wherever possible at 0.6 IW/CPE
ratio (50 mm depth of water). It requires five
or six irrigations during dry months at an
interval of 22 days. Mulching the crop with
dry leaves at 6 t ha-1 will help to conserve
moisture.
223
PINEAPPLE
Weed control
For effective and economic weed control,
use weedicides. Pre-emergent spray with
diuron 3 kg or bromacil 2.5 kg in 600 litres of
water per hectare completely controls all types
of weeds in pineapple plantation. If there is
subsequent growth of weeds, herbicide
application may be repeated at half the above
dose. Spraying should be done when there is
adequate moisture in the soil. Avoid periods of
heavy rainfall for spraying.
Induction of flowering
For inducement of uniform flowering,
apply 25 ppm ethephon (2-chloro ethyl
phosphonic acid) in aqueous solution
containing 2 per cent urea and 0.04 per cent
calcium carbonate as follows:
The mixture (50 ml/plant) is to be applied
pouring into the heart of 10-12 months old
plants (39-42 leaf stage) during dry weather.
For treating 1000 plants, 50 litres of the
solution would be required. (The ingredients
for preparing 50 litres of the aqueous
solution are ethephon 1.25 ml, urea 1 kg and
calcium carbonate 20 g, made up to 50 litres
with water. The dosage has to be fixed
depending on the availability of commercial
formulation and the active ingredient
contents). Fruits will be ready for harvest by
5 ¼ - 5 ¾ months after the application of
growth regulator.
Flowering will commence from 40th day
after application and complete by  70th day.
2. MAURITIUS
Mauritius 
is 
recommended 
for
commercial cultivation for table purposes and
distant marketing, due to its shorter duration,
better fruit quality, keeping quality and
transportability.
Season
Main season of planting is April-May and
August-September, but can also be planted in
all months except during heavy rain of June-
July. The best time for planting is
August. For getting maximum price and
better keeping quality, the best planting time is
April-May. During summer months, if there are
no summer showers after planting, irrigation
should be given three weeks after planting for
proper establishment.
Cropping system
Mauritius can be grown as a pure crop in
garden land, reclaimed lowlands and
wetlands and as an intercrop in coconut and
newly planted rubber plantations. In
rubber plantation, it can be grown for the first
3-4 years only.
Land preparation
Pure crop : Prepare the land by digging the
area to be planted at 90 cm width in rows/
strips, leaving the interspaces undisturbed.
However, ploughing can be adopted in level
land. Planting is done in paired rows of
45 cm distance between rows and 30 cm
between suckers. Suckers may be planted in
triangular method in the paired rows.
Interspace between the paired rows is kept at
150 cm. Contour planting may be adopted in
sloppy areas.
Intercropping in coconut garden: Land
preparation, spacing and planting are the same
as described above. There can be three-paired
rows in between two rows of coconut.
Intercropping in rubber plantations:
System of planting is in paired rows at
45 cm x 30 cm. There will be only one paired
row of pineapple in between two rows of
rubber.
Cowpea, sunhemp or daincha can be sown
in the interspaces and covered with soil soon
PINEAPPLE
224
after planting the suckers.  The biomass can
be uprooted at flowering  and applied to
pineapple plots as manure.  This will also help
to control the weeds by smothering them up to
four months.
Wetlands / lowlands: Pineapple is highly
sensitive to water stagnation and high
moisture regimes. Hence it is important to
provide good drainage, if grown in wetlands.
In paddy lands, pineapple is planted in paired
rows at 45 cm x 30 cm spacing on ridges taken
at 60-90 cm height, depending on the water
table and drainage requirement. The ridges are
separated by drainage channels having 60 cm
width. The width of the ridges varies from 120-
150 cm. Wherever water stagnation and poor
drainage are expected, a wider and deeper
channel is given in between ridges.
Selection of suckers
Suckers are selected from disease and pest
free healthy plants. Suckers are to be graded
into those having 500-750 g and 750-1000 g.
The graded suckers are planted in different
blocks or plots, to get uniformity in growth and
flowering. Bigger suckers give early yield.
Dipping  in 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture and
0.05 per cent quinalphos will protect the suckers
against diseases and pests.
Prophylactic treatment of suckers:  A
combination of Mancozeb (0.03 per cent a.i.)
and Chlorpyrifos (0.05 per cent a.i.) can also
be used for sucker treatment.  Dipping
suckers in 0.2 per cent Pseudomonas is also
effective to control suckers from diseases.
Planting
After preliminary land preparations,
planting is done in small pits of 10-15 cm depth
at a spacing of 45 cm between rows and
30 cm between plants in the rows. There is no
need to plant the suckers in trenches.
Manuring
Apply compost / FYM @ 25 t ha-1 at the
time of planting.  Application of 10 t ha-1 (250g/
plant) of poultry manure or vermi-
compost., or 2 t ha-1 (50g/plant) of neem cake
along with 2.5kg of Azospirillum (1g/plant) and
2.5kg of Phosphobactor is also equally
effective. Apply fertilizers @ 8:4:8 g
N:P2O5:K2O per plant per year. Full dose of
P2O5 is applied at the time of planting.
Nitrogen and K2O are applied as four equal
split doses after planting. First dose may be
applied at 40-50 days after planting and
thereafter at 60-70 days intervals.
Intercropping
Vegetables and tuber crops can be grown
as rainfed intercrops.  Plant ginger or coleus
(in four rows at 30 cm x 30 cm spacing in raised
beds) or brinjal or bhindi (in two rows at 75 cm
x 60cm spacing) in the inter space in May last
week.  This will help to obtain additional returns
and also control weed growth.
Irrigation
Wherever irrigation facilities are available,
providing irrigation in summer months at two
weeks intervals results in good fruit size and
high yield. If there is no irrigation facility, the
crop should be scheduled for harvest before
summer months (before March).
Weed control
Pre-emergence (within a few weeks
after planting) spray of diuron @ 1 kg ha-1 in
600 litres of water can keep the field free of
weeds for about four months. For subsequent
weed control, herbicide application is
repeated. For controlling Mikania micrantha
225
PINEAPPLE
(vayara valli or American valli), spot
application of diuron can be adopted. Spraying
should be done in moist soil, but avoid rainy
periods. Weeds in interspaces can be controlled
by spraying glyphosate 0.8 kg ha-1.  While
spraying in interspaces, care should be taken
that the weedicide shall not fall on pineapple
plant.
Flower induction
For inducing uniform flowering, 25 ppm
ethephon is applied on physiologically
mature plants having 39-42 leaves (7-8 months
after planting). The solution for application
in 1000 plants is prepared by adding 1.25 ml of
ethephon (3.2 ml of 39 per cent ethrel or 12.5
ml of 10 per cent ethrel), 1 kg urea and 20 g
calcium carbonate to 50 litres of water. Pour
50 ml of the prepared solution to the heart of
the plant during dry weather conditions (when
there is no rain during the time of application).
Flowering starts by 30 days and
completes within 40 days of growth
regulator application. Fruits will be ready for
harvest by 130-135 days after the application
of growth regulator. Harvest over
different months / seasons could be obtained
by carefully phasing / planning the planting and
growth regulator application.
Plant protection
Sun burn: During summer months it is
necessary to protect the fruits from
scorching sun by putting dried grasses,
coconut or arecanut leaves.
Diseases
Root rot / heart rot / fruit rot caused by
Phytophthora sp. is common in poor
drainage conditions. Providing drainage is most
essential. The water table should be at least
60 cm below the soil surface. Badly affected
plants should be destroyed and the remaining
plants should be drenched with 1 per cent
Bordeaux mixture in the soil. Leaf spot can be
controlled by spraying 1 per cent Bordeaux
mixture or mancozeb 2 g l-1.
Pests
Mealy bugs (Dysmicoccus brevipes/
Pseudococcus bromeliae): Spray quinalphos
0.05 per cent, chlorpyriphos 0.05 per cent or
dimethoate 0.05 per cent. Care should be taken
that the spray shall reach the base and also
the sides of the plant. The plot should be kept
weed free. For the control of mealy bugs,
control of ants is a must.
Pineapple wilt associated virus is
transmitted by mealy bugs (Dysmicoccus
brevipes Cockerell). Mealy bugs are
mobilized by ants. For the management
of the disease, preventive methods like,
destruction of diseased plants, treating
suckers by dipping in chlorpyrifos 0.05 per cent
before planting, keeping pineapple fields weed
free and control of mealy bugs by spraying/
drenching with chlorpyrifos 0.05 per cent are
to be adopted.
Scale insects (Diaspus bromeliae):
Spraying of chemicals for the control of mealy
bugs, mentioned above, will be sufficient for
the control of scale insects.
Ratoon cropping
The plant crop after harvest can be
retained as ratoon crop for two more years.
After the harvest of the plant crop, chopping
the side leaves of the mother plant should be
done for easy cultural operations. The
suckers retained should be limited to one or
two per mother plant. Excess suckers if any
should be removed. Earthing up should be
done. Other management practices are same
as for the plant crop.
PINEAPPLE
226
SAPOTA (Manilkara zapota)
Sapota requires a temperature range of 11
to 34oC and an annual precipitation of
225-375 cm. It can be grown in all types of
soil, but well drained soil is necessary for good
growth.
Varieties
Cricket Ball, Oval, Kalipatti, Badami,
Baramasi, Calcutta Round, Pala and PKM-1
Propagation
It is propagated through layers and grafts.
Manilkara hexandra (khirni) is the best
rootstock for inarching sapota.
Season
The season of planting is May-June.
Planting should be avoided during the
periods of heavy rains.
Planting
Planting is done in pits of 60 cm x 60 cm x
60 cm at a square spacing of 7-8 m.
Manuring
The recommended nutrient dosage for a
full-grown sapota tree per year is:
FYM
55 kg
N:P2O5:K2O
500:360:750 g
Apply FYM in May-June with the
onset of monsoon. Apply the fertilizers
in two equal split doses, the first during
May-June and the second during August-
September.
Apply the manures and fertilizers in
trenches 30 cm deep taken at a distance of
1 m from the base of the tree.
Irrigation
Irrigation may not be necessary except
during the early stages and in the hot
weather; but good crops can be obtained
with irrigation.
Training and pruning
No pruning is necessary; but in old trees,
lower branches can be removed up to 1 m
height.
Flowering and fruiting
The tree flowers continuously in several
flushes at short intervals throughout the year.
But there are two seasons when flowers will
be produced profusely i.e., October to
November and February to March. Grafted
sapota begins to bear in the third year after
planting. Fruit production increases with age
up to 30 years followed by a decline. Fruits
mature about 4 months after flowering.
Harvesting
Mature fruits, which are dull brown in
colour, are harvested and stored for about five
days before they are fully ripened for
consumption. Ripe fruits can be kept for about
5 to 7 days.
WEST INDIAN CHERRY (Malphigia punicifolia)
West Indian cherry, also known as
Barbados cherry is the richest source of
vitamin C. It is a medium sized shrub, which
thrives well in tropical climate. It is best suited
as a homestead fruit crop and prefers a rich
well drained soil.
Varieties
Two distinct types are seen.
Pink flower type
Flowers are pink and are born in
clusters in leaf axils. Fruits are large in size
227
SAPOTA AND WEST INDIAN CHERRY
APPLE (Malus sylvestris)
Apple is an important temperate fruit suited
for growing in the high ranges of Kerala. Slop-
ing sites to allow free drainage are considered
more suitable than level tops. The ideal soil
types are loam, sandy loam and silt loam with
open porous and well-drained subsoil.
(about 6 g) and red coloured when ripe.
White flower type
Flowers are white and are borne in
clusters in leaf axils. Fruits are small (about
1 g) and orange coloured when fully ripe.
Planting materials
West Indian cherry is usually raised from
layers.  Vegetative propagation by means of
hardwood cuttings along with leaves is
feasible, though the percentage of rooting is
very low. Air layering is highly successful when
treated with IBA. Layers strike roots within
3-4 weeks. When the roots peep out through
the ball of moss or coir pith, the stem may be
severed in stages. The rooted layer is potted
after removing the polythene film and kept in
shade till new flushes appear. Plants may be
hardened in full sunlight prior to transplanting.
Chip budding, shield budding, side grafting and
veneer grafting are also successful to a
limited extent.
Planting
For planting, pits of size 0.5 m x 0.5 m x 0.5 m
are made, 6 m apart. Fill the pit with topsoil
and 10 kg cowdung. After planting, mulching
may be done with dry leaves to conserve mois-
ture. July to December is considered to be the
best time for planting. Irrigation once in four
days during early stages of growth up to one
year of planting and later on, once in 7-10 days
is necessary.
Manuring
A fully grown, bearing plant should be top
dressed with fertilizers @ 100 g N,
160 g P2O5 and 260 g K2O. These may be
applied in two splits, in June-July and again in
January, when there is sufficient moisture in
the soil.
Pruning
Pruning is done once in a year to
maintain regular shape. Pruning consists of
removal of dried and diseased wood and also
the drooping branches.
Flowering, fruiting and harvesting
Rooted cuttings and layers flower in six
months. Flowering commences in the middle
of May and extends up to August. The
harvest of fruits commences from August and
continues up to November. Rarely, flowering
is noticed in March and the crop comes to
harvest in April / May.
Yield
The average yield during fourth year is
2 kg per plant.
Processing
The fruits may be consumed fresh or its
pulp can be used for preparation of juice, jam,
jelly, preserve, syrup etc. The juice or pulp may
also be used to fortify ascorbic acid
content of various other products. Its juice can
be used to blend with other fruit juices to give
delicious mixed fruit cocktails and
also to improve their nutritive value. As the
richest natural source of vitamin C.
Preparation of land
The planting distance in India varies from
7-10 m, depending upon the vigour of plant.
The pit should be of 1 m wide and 20 cm deep
so that all roots may be accommodated in a
well spread condition.

secondary branches. During the second
dormant pruning, the crowded, misplaced or
diseased secondary branches are removed and
the extra vigorous ones headed back. This pro-
cess is continued for 4 or 5 years, at the end of
which there are 8 to 10 scaffold branches.
It is desirable to add 100-150 g of nitrogen
as sulphate of ammonia. Similar quantities of
phosphate and potash should be added when
required. Five quintals of bone meal and 10
quintals of wood ash per hectare are given
annually besides the fertilizers. Fertilizers should
be mixed with the soil at a radius of 1 m from
the plant.
Thinning of fruit
Thinning of fruit is also practised in
order to improve fruit colour and fruit size. It
is desirable to retain one fruit for every
40 leaves. This spaces the fruit at about
15-20 cm apart and there will be only one fruit
per spur.
Harvesting
Much of the success in apple production
depends on proper picking, storage and
disposal. When a fruit separates easily from
the spur, firmness of flesh and taste are
desirable. The harvested fruits may be stored
for 120-150 days at 4-5oC, provided there is
good circulation of air.
Planting material
Apples are ordinarily propagated by
budding or grafting on seedlings of Crab apple,
Yellow Newton or Golden Delicious. Winters
are best for whip grafting. Shield budding is
done in June with the season’s bud. Both whip
grafting and shield budding are widely prac-
ticed in India. Low chilling varieties are suit-
able for Kerala.
Time and method of planting
Apples are planted in the ground free of
weeds. Regularly irrigated for about two years
in the beginning. Planting is done late in win-
ter. For adequate root development a
temperature of 7oC is considered ideal.
Pruning
Pruning and training are important in apple
cultivation. One year old plants are cut back
at about 80-100 cm above ground. If branches
are present at this time, only 4 to 5 of them
ought to be retained and shortened in length.
No shoot is retained upto 50 cm from ground.
At the time of first dormant pruning, the main
scaffold branches are cut back to about half a
metre in length.
Secondary branches arise from these main
limbs. Some of the new shoots arising early in
the second summer are rubbed off in
order to develop only a few vigorous

ORNAMENTAL PLANTS
ANTHURIUM (Anthurium spp.)
Anthurium is one of the important
economic flowers of export potential. There
are more than 500 species and several varieties.
Few of them are commercially important.
Anthurium andreanum, is  economically
cultivated for cut flowers. They are partially
epiphytic in growth habit. Plants prefer to grow
under shade. The tolerable level of light in the
tropical region during summer is 20-30 per cent.
Excess light causes yellowing and scorching
of leaves. Very low light intensity causes
excessive vegetative growth and low
flowering. It is preferable to grow anthurium
in the open, under artificial shade structures
for better growth and yield. Plant prefers to
grow under a relative humidity of not less than
60 per cent and a temperature of not more
than 18-28oC.
Propagation
Anthurium is multiplied by seed and
vegetatively by stem cuttings or by separation of
basal sprouts. Propagation by seed is not
recommended as a commercial propagation
method as it results in high variability. Plants
can be multiplied in large number by
micro-propagation techniques from the
tender leaf bits.
Varieties
The economic varieties suitable for Kerala
condition are Lima White, Cuba, Agnihotri,
Liver Red, Can Can, Tropical, Nitta, Sunburst,
Linda-de-Mol, Tinora, Acropolis, Gino Orange
and Midori.
Planting and after care
Plants are propagated vegetatively by
separating suckers from flowering plants as
and when available and planted in the
medium. Cutting the thick main stem into
3-4 cm long discs and then into vertical bits
can also be done.  Each bit should have
minimum two lateral buds. Cut-pieces are
treated with a fungicide solution and planted
on a medium of clean river sand. Cuttings will
take 1-2 months for sprouting.
Seedlings and sprouted cuttings of
5-10 cm height are transferred to the main field
or pots. Planting in pots is preferred in the plains.
Cultivation in beds is good at higher altitudes
(about 1000 m above MSL). A loose medium
above the ground is suitable for
anthurium. Old and chopped coconut husk (3
cm size) mixed with brick pieces and
charcoal are filled in narrow trenches 10 cm
below and above ground level.
Pots can also be filled with the same
mixture. An ideal pot should be 30 cm
diameter at top with 3 large holes at the bottom
on sides. One plant can be planted in a pot. On
ground, the spacing is 45 to 60 cm depending
upon the variety. Fresh cowdung or neem cake
mixed with 10-15 times of water, kept for 4-5
days, can be sprayed on the plants after
filtering. Cow’s urine can be sprayed or
drenched after mixing with 25 times of water.
Water soluble fertilizer (19:19:19) 2 g / l  is
applied in the medium once a week. Slow
release fertilizers, if used, need be given only
once in 2-3 months. Pruning of older leaves,
removal of suckers at young stage, cleaning of
crown before rains etc. are other operations to
be carried out in order to have a better growth
and flowering.

ORCHIDS
Orchids are noted for their bewitchingly
beautiful, long lasting flowers, widely
differing in shape, size and colour. They
belong to the family Orchidaceae, reported to
comprise over 600 genera, 30000 species and
about 1.5 lakhs man made hybrids. They have
varying habitats but epiphytic orchids
dominate the trade. They are also classed as
monopodials (stems having a vertical growth,
non branching, with aerial roots) and sympodials
(stems having a horizontal growth, producing
pseudobulbs in clusters, no aerial roots).
The ideal location for orchid growing is in
the open conditions, under appropriate level of
shade.  In Kerala certain orchids are grown
under the shade of old coconut trees.
Most attractive orchids belong to the group
of 
epiphytes, 
which 
require 
free
moving air at all times. They produce aerial
roots, which absorb water and nutrients from
Plant protection
Diseases
The two major diseases are bacterial blight
and anthracnose. Blackening of the stem and
decay of leaf axils are the symptoms of
bacterial blight. Spraying a mixture of
turmeric powder and sodium bi carbonate in
the proportion 10:1@ 0.15 per cent at weekly
interval from the initiation of the disease is
effective for the management of bacterial blight
of anthurium.
Tiny circular black spots appear on leaf and
spadix in case of anthracnose. Spraying
mancozeb 0.3 per cent or carbendazim 0.05
per cent can control the disease.
Root rot caused by Pythium and
Phytophthora can be controlled by the
application of potassium phosphonate 0.3 per
cent.
Pests
The major pests are scales and bugs, which
are controlled by spraying malathion @ 2 ml
per litre of water. Snails also cause damage to
young roots. Use of metaldehyde can prevent
the attack of snails.
Harvesting
The flowers are harvested with its long stem
when 1/4th to 3/4th flowers on the spadix are open,
indicated by the change of colour. Colour
change varies with the varieties.
the atmosphere. Both terrestrial and epiphytes
grow under varying levels of shade. Plants
grown under deep shade will have good
vegetative growth and poor flowering. Hence
shade and light regulations are very important
operations for better flowering. A humid and
warm atmosphere is congenial for the growth
of most of the tropical orchids. Better results
are obtained when the atmospheric humidity
is 50 to 80 per cent. Orchids require proper
temperature for good growth and flowering.
Accordingly there are tropical, subtropical and
temperate orchids.
Genera/varieties
The popular genera of orchids
that are suitable for growing in Kerala are
Arachnis, Aranthera, Vanda, Phalaenopsis
(monopodials); Aranda, Mokara (inter-
generic monopodials); Dendrobium,
Cattleya, Oncidium (sympodials).
231
ANTHURIUM AND ORCHIDS
Dendrobium is the most popular genus of
Kerala. Some of the important varieties
belonging to this genus are given below,
grouped according to colour.
Purple and white : Sonia 17, Sonia 28, Sonia
Bom Jo and Earsakul
Purple : Renappa, New Wanee, Sabine Red,
Jurie Red, Master Delight and Velvet Soft
White : Emma White, Fairy White, Kasem
White and Snow White
Pink : Sakura Pink, New Pink, Lemon Glow
and Pink Cascade
Yellow : Sherifa Fatimah, Kasem Gold and
Tongchai Gold
Magenta : Deep Blush
Propagation
The conventional method of propagation is
by vegetative means. Monopodial orchids are
propagated by stem cuttings. Terminal cuttings
with one or two healthy aerial roots are ideal
as planting material. Basal cuttings of 30 cm
length with a few roots and leaves are also
good. But they take longer time to sprout and
grow. Sympodial orchids are propagated by
separation of pseudobulbs. A plant with
minimum two or three pseudobulbs with the
basal root is ideal for planting. Some of the
sympodial varieties produce sprouts at the top
of pseudobulb called as keikis. Keikis when
fully grown can be separated and planted.
Besides, back-bulbs or spent canes (shoots that
have ceased to produce flowers) before they
get shrivelled can be severed from the mother
plant and placed horizontally over the medium
to stimulate sprouting of new shoots.
Seed propagation is possible only under
aseptic conditions. Seedlings produced by
embryo culture will take 2-5 years for
flowering, depending on the genus.
Meristem culture is very effective in
large scale propagation of orchids.
Planting
Terminal cuttings of monopodial orchids are
planted loosely on old coconut husks at a
spacing of 30 cm between plants and
45 cm between rows in long beds. There can
be two or three rows in a bed. Basal cuttings
will sprout within a period of two months.
Partial shade up to 50 per cent is required for
sprouting. Basal cuttings are planted close to
each other in nursery beds for sprouting. After
sprouting they are planted at the
recommended spacing. Monopodial orchids
can be grown on ground above soil level. A
thick bed of 15-20 cm height is loosely
arranged. Well-dried coconut husks are
better than fresh husks. Sympodial orchids are
grown on benches above ground level or
suspended from above. Slotted wooden baskets
filled with small pieces of dried coconut husk
or partially burnt charcoal is good for plant
growth. Planting is done above the medium
with a support for proper anchorage.
Planting can also be done in pots or other
containers. Mud pots of 10-20 cm diameter
with several large holes on the side and
bottom, filled with tile bits, chopped coconut
husk or charcoal are used for planting. A clear
solution of fresh cowdung can be used for
irrigation for a few days. Dipping in fresh
cowdung solution before planting also gives
good results.
Manuring
Monopodial orchids grown on ground can
be given cowdung slurry once in a month. One
kg fresh cowdung mixed in 5 litres of water is
sufficient for one square metre. Two to three
applications can be given in a year. Sympodial
orchids are sprayed with the supernatant liquid
of cowdung slurry. Nutrition of plants from the
ORCHIDS
232
JASMINE (Jasminum spp.)
natural sources is not sufficient to support the
plants for economic production. Hence
additional feeding is required. Foliar feeding is
very effective in orchids. Fertilizer mixture of
N:P2O5:K2O 3:1:1 can be applied during
vegetative period and 1:2:2 can be applied
during flowering period. The usual dose of such
mixture is 2-3 g per litre of water,
applied twice a week.
Plant protection
Diseases
The important fungal diseases are leaf spot,
leaf blight, collar blotch, collar rot and orchid
wilt.
These can be controlled by application of
mancozeb, carbendazim etc. at the
recommended dose. Spraying should be done
prior to the commencement of monsoon and
at fortnightly intervals during heavy
monsoon. Important virus diseases are
mosaic and ring spot. Destroying the affected
plants can control spread of these diseases.
Pests
The common pests attacking orchids are
thrips, aphids, spider mite, soft scale, mealy
bugs, orchid weevil, ants etc. Other very
serious pests of orchids are snails and slugs.
They feed on the tender young shoots, roots
and buds. Hand-picking is effective, if the
number of plants is less. They move out
during late night and hide before early morning.
Damage is caused during this period. All the
pests can be controlled by application of contact
and systemic insecticides at appropriate
concentration.
Harvesting
The spikes are harvested before the
opening of all the buds of the spike, depending
on the genus.
Jasmine is an important flower crop that
could be grown on a commercial scale in
Kerala. Jasminum sambac is the most ideal
species for cultivation in Kerala. The
flowers are used for preparing garlands. The
jasmine oil has great export potential in
addition to its use for medicinal purpose.
Important cultivars
There are trailing, climbing and erect grow-
ing species and cultivars. Three important
species and their varieties are given as follows:
1. Jasminum sambac: Gundumalli, Motia,
Virupakshi, Sujimalli, Madanabanam,
Ramabanam.
2. Jasminum grandiflorum: Co-1 Pitchi,
Co-2 Pitchi, Thimmapuram, Lucknow.
3. Jasminum auriculatum: Co-1 Mulla,
Co-2 Mulla, Long Point, Long Round, Short
Point, Short Round.
Soil and climate
Jasmine can be planted on a wide range of
soils. Well-drained sandy loams and red loams
are ideal for its cultivation. In clayey soils, there
is increased vegetative growth and reduced
flowering. They give good yield in low rainfall
conditions.
Propagation
Layering and cutting are the main
propagation methods. Better rooting of
cuttings can be obtained by planting in coarse
sand and also by using any of the rooting
hormones like IBA (5000 ppm), IAA (1000
ppm) and NAA (5000 ppm). Simple and
compound layering methods are followed
233
ORCHIDS AND JASMINE
GLADIOLUS (Gladiolus spp.)
Gladiolus is grown for its attractive
flower spike having florets of huge form,
dazzling colour and varying sizes, with long
vase life.
Varieties
Friendship, Spic and Span, Mansoer Red,
Dr. Fleming, Peter Pears and White
during June-July to October-November. Layers
will be ready for planting within 90-120 days.
Planting
After ploughing the land, pits of about
40 cm x 40 cm x 40 cm size are taken and
filled with topsoil and 15 kg well rotten FYM.
Planting distance depends on the species as
given in table below and also on soil and envi-
ronmental conditions.
Planting is usually done during June-
August.
Manuring
Each plant requires a fertilizer dose of
120 g N, 240 g P2O5 and 240 g K2O. The
fertilizers are mixed together and applied in two
split doses during January and July. This has
to be supplemented with organic manures like
neem cake, groundnut oil cake etc. @ 100 g
per plant per month.
Pruning
Pruning is essential and is done at a height
of 45 cm from the ground level during mid
December-January.
Weed control
Manual weeding is usually done which is
effective but expensive. Mulching also
reduces weed population.
Irrigation
Constant and adequate water supply
during peak flowering season (March-Octo-
ber) is essential for high yield of flowers. Af-
ter flowering is over,  water supply can be cut
off. During summer, irrigate twice a week.
Diseases
Leaf blight: Can be controlled by spraying 0.2
per cent mancozeb.
Fusarium wilt: Prevented by drenching the soil
with 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture.

Soil
It can be grown in a wide range of soils,
JASMINE AND GLADIOLUS
234
light sandy to clay loam. Deep well-drained
acidic soils with a pH of 5.5-6.5 are the best
for cultivation.
Propagation
Gladiolus is propagated by corms and
cormels. Size of the corm markedly influences
the growth and flowering of gladiolus. Medium
and large sized corms are preferred for planting,
as small corms produce only small flower
spikes.
Planting
The land is ploughed two or three
times and FYM @ 25 t ha-1 is applied and
mixed well with the soil. Ridges are made
20 cm apart. Fertilizer application is made
@ 50:60:60 kg N:P2O5:K2O per ha. The corms
are planted at a distance of 30 cm and at 5 cm
depth. About one lakh plants can be
accomodated in a hectare. Top dress the crop
with 50 kg N, 45 days after planting and earth
up. Best season for planting is September-
November.
Irrigation
The crop has to be irrigated once in two or
three days depending upon soil and weather
conditions.
Plant protection
Several species of aphids like green peach
aphid, potato aphid and melon aphid damage
developing foliage and flowers. They can be
controlled by using dimethoate. Thrips and
caterpillars can be controlled with dimethoate.
Brown and Fusarium wilts are the
major diseases. Spraying the crop with
0.3 per cent copper oxychloride or drenching
carbendazim 0.05 per cent is recommended
when diseases are noticed.
Harvesting and yield
The plant starts flowering in 2-3 months
after planting based on the variety. The
entire spike along with two leaves is cut, when
the basal flower bud starts opening. Nearly
2 lakh flower spikes can be obtained from one
hectare.
After harvest of flowers, the plants are left
undisturbed in the field. When they start
yellowing, the plants are uprooted for
harvest of corms and cormels.
TUBEROSE (Poliantha tuberosa)
Tuberose occupies a very special position
among the ornamental bulbous plants because
of its prettiness, elegance and fragrance. It has
good economic potential for loose/cut flower
trade and essential oil industry.
Cultivars
There are three groups of cultivars as given
below:
1.
Single: Flower is pure white and has only
a single row of corolla segments.
Cultivars are Sringar, Culcutta Single,
Mexican Single and Suvarna Rekha.
2.
Double: Flowers are white, tinged with
pinkish red. Petals are in several whorls.
Cultivars are Suvasini, Culcutta Double
and Pearl.
3.
Semi-double: Similar to double but with
only 2 to 3 rows of corolla segments.
This classification is based on floral
characters.
Soil
Porous, well-drained sandy loam soils are
best suited for tuberose cultivation.
235
GLADIOLUS AND TUBEROSE
CROSSANDRA (Crossandra infundibuliformis)
Crossandra flowers are very popular for
their bright orange colour, light weight and
keeping quality. The flowers are of great
demand for garlands and hair adornments.
Cultivars
Yellow Orange, Lutea Yellow and Delhi
(triploid) are the important varieties.
Soil
Crossandra can be cultivated in a
wide range of soils. Fertile, red loamy soils with
pH range of 6.0 to 7.5 are ideal.
Propagation
Propagation is by seeds or stem cuttings.
Seedlings are ready for transplanting when they
Propagation
Propagation is by bulbs. Boat shaped bulbs
of size 2 to 3 cm are preferred for
planting. About 1.25 to 1.50 lakh bulbs
(800 to 900 kg) are required for planting one
hectare.
Cultural practices
Land is prepared well by ploughing two or
three times. FYM @ 30 t ha-1 is mixed well
with soil. Best time for planting is May-July. The
bulbs preferably those of size 2-5 cm or above
are to be planted at a depth of 7-10 cm, with a
spacing of 20 cm x 25 cm. A fertilizer dosage
of 100:50:50 kg ha-1  N:P2O5:K2O is recom-
mended. Of these, half N, full P2O5 and K2O
are applied at the time of planting.
Remaining N is applied when the flower spikes
start to appear. A heavy irrigation once in 5-10
days is necessary depending upon the weather
conditions. The peak flowering is between June
and October.
Ratoon crop
After the harvest of the main crop, the
flower stalks are headed back and the plot is
manured and irrigated. Three or four ratoon
crops can be taken from single planting.
Plant protection
Slugs and grass hoppers, which feed on the
leaves and thrips which damage and cause dis-
tortion of the spikes are the major pests.
Malathion is effective against these pests. No
major disease is noticed.
Harvest and yield
Tuberose is harvested by cutting the spikes
from the base for table decoration or the
individual flower is picked from the spike for
making garlands and other floral ornaments:
The average yield of flower is as follows:
Plant crop:                       5-10 t ha-1
First ratoon:                     9-12 t ha-1
Second ratoon:                             4-6 t ha-1
have four or five pairs of leaves. In the case
of triploid varieties like Delhi, cuttings are used.
Cuttings should be transplanted when sufficient
roots are developed.
Cultural hints
The land has to be ploughed three or four
times. FYM @ 25 t ha-1 is incorporated and
mixed well in the soil. Ridges are prepared
60 cm apart. A fertilizer dose of 33.3:60:60 kg
ha-1 N:P 2O5:K2O is applied as basal.
The seedlings or cuttings are transplanted at a
spacing of 30 cm.
The crop is topdressed twice with
33.3 kg N per ha each time, the first at
3 months after transplanting and the second
TUBEROSE AND CROSSANDRA

8-9 months after transplanting. The application
of fertilizers is to be necessarily followed by
irrigation. Weeding, application of fertilizer and
earthing up are combined together for easy
maintenance of the crop.
Plant protection
Scales, plant bugs and white flies are the
important insect pests, which can be
controlled by phosalone (0.07 per cent).
Wilt caused by Fusarium solani will
result in yellowing of leaves and death of the
MARIGOLD (Tagetes spp.)
Marigold is a popular annual flower that can
be grown on a commercial scale. It has gained
popularity on account of its easy
cultivation and wide adaptability. Free
flowering habit, short duration to produce
marketable flowers, wide spectrum of colour,
shape, size and good keeping quality make
marigold an acceptable commercial crop.
Cultivars
There are two species of marigold, namely,
African marigold (Tagetes erecta) and French
marigold (Tagetes patula). Inter-specific
hybrids between these two species also have
been evolved, which are known as Red and
Gold hybrids. Varieties under this group are
Nugget, Show Boat and Red Seven Star.
African marigold varieties
Apricot, Primrose, Sun Giant, Guinea Gold,
Fiesta, Golden Yellow, Hawaii, Crown of Gold,
Honey Comb, Cupid, Pusa Narangi Gaintha
and Pusa Basanti Gaintha.
French marigold varieties
Rusty Red, Naughty, Marietta, Flame, Star
of India and Harmony.
Soil
A wide range of soils with good drainage is
suitable for cultivation of marigold. Sandy loam
soil with pH 5.6 to 6.5 is ideal.
Propagation
Seeds are used for raising the crop.
Cultural practices
 Prepare nursery beds of 6 m length,
1.2 m width and 10-20 cm height. Apply
30 kg FYM along with 0.5 kg of 15:15:15
fertilizer mixture and mix them well in the soil.
Sow the seeds in rows 7.5 cm apart. Cover
the seeds with fine FYM and irrigate. The
seedlings will be ready for transplanting within
one month.
For the main-field, the land should be
ploughed well and FYM @ 20 t ha-1 should be
incorporated to the soil. Apply a basal dose of
fertilizers @ 112.5 kg N, 60 kg P2O5, and 60
kg K2O per ha. Transplant the seedlings at a
spacing of 30 cm x 30 cm in case of French
marigold and 45 cm x 45 cm in case of African
marigold on one side of the ridge and irrigate.
plants. The incidence of the disease is found
to be more in the presence of root lesion
nematode.
Harvest and yield
Crossandra flowers within two to three
months after planting and continues to bear
flowers throughout the year with a lean
production season during rainy months.
Flowers are to be picked early in the morning
by pulling the corolla out of the calyx. Harvesting
of flowers is to be done on alternate days. The
yield of flowers is about 5 t ha-1.

CROSSANDRA AND MARIGOLD
China aster is a free blooming, colourful
annual flower. It is grown on a commercial
scale in many parts of India. Bright coloured
flowers of China aster are in much demand
for the preparation of bouquets and flower
arrangements.
Varieties
Ostrich Plume, Comet, Poornima, Kamini,
Sasank, Violet cushion etc. are some of the
commercial varieties.
Soil
Though it could be cultivated on a wide
range of soils, well-drained red loamy soil is
ideal.
Propagation
Commercially propagated by seeds.
Cultural practices
Seedlings are to be raised in nursery beds
of size 7.5 m long, 1.2 m wide and 10 cm height
for preparing planting materials for an area of
one hectare. The seeds are sown thinly and
CHINA ASTER (Callistephus chinensis)
Top dress the crop with 112.5 kg N per ha at
the time of pinching (30-45 days after
transplanting) and earth up. Pinching is done
to increase the total yield. It consists of
removing terminal portion of the plant 30-45
days after transplanting.
Irrigate once in 4-6 days depending
upon soil moisture and weather conditions.
Weeds have to be removed at monthly
intervals.
Plant protection
Marigold is not attacked by many pests.
However, flower beetles, leaf hoppers,
stalk borers, mites etc. cause occasional
problems. These plants are rarely attacked by
diseases. In poorly drained soils, foot rot caused
by Phytophthora may occur. Stem rot caused
by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is also reported.
Soil drenching with copper oxychloride 0.3 per
cent is helpful in checking foot rot, while stem
rot is controlled by drenching with fungicides.
Harvest and yield
Marigold flowers will be ready for
harvest in about 21/2 months time from the date
of transplanting. The plant continues to bear
flowers for another 2-21/2 months.  The
flowers are harvested when they have
attained full size. Harvest the flowers in the
evening along with a portion of stalk. Yield of
French marigold will be 8-12 t ha-1 and that of
African marigold 11-18 t ha-1.
covered with fine FYM. The seedbeds are
irrigated immediately after sowing. The
seedlings will be ready for transplanting in
about four weeks.
For transplanting, prepare the main field by
ploughing land three or four times. FYM is
applied @ 10-15 t ha-1 and mixed well with the
soil. Chemical fertilizers @ 90 kg N,
120 kg P2O5 and 60 kg K2O per ha are
required as basal dose. Seedlings of 4 weeks
are transplanted at a spacing of  30 cm x
30 cm. The crop has to be top dressed with
50 kg N at 40 days of transplanting. The crop
has to be irrigated once in 4-5 days depending
upon the soil and weather conditions. Earthing
up has to be done twice at 30 days intervals.
Harvest and yield
China aster blossoms will be ready for
harvest within 10-12 weeks of transplanting.
Generally the entire plant is harvested when
most of the flowers in the plant are opened
and made into bundles of 10-12 each. The yield
will be 10-12 t ha-1.

MEDICINAL  AND  AROMATIC PLANTS
EUCALYPTUS  (Eucalyptus citriodora)
Eucalyptus thrives both in the tropics and
subtropics. High humidity and plenty of
rainfall are conducive to its luxuriant growth.
It can be grown in varied types of soils. The
essential oil is used in the preparation of
cosmetics, hair oil and soap.
Preparation of land
Clear the land of jungle growth. Take pits
of size 45 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm at a spacing
2 m x 2 m at least one month prior to planting
and allow to weather. Fill up the pits with soil
completely so as to prevent water stagnation.
Planting
Nursery is raised and 4-5 months
old seedlings are planted with the
commencement of southwest monsoon.
After planting, press the soil around the
seedling and form mound to prevent
stagnation of water.
Manuring
Manuring is not usually done. However,
application of 400 g ammonium sulphate,
60 g superphosphate and 25 g muriate of
potash per plant per year during August from
third year onwards is found to be useful in
increasing leaf yield.
After cultivation
During first year, cultivate the rows in both
directions to prevent weed growth. Hand
weeding is done around the seedlings. Fire
belts are to be provided all around.
Intercropping
Eucalyptus can be grown along with
coffee, lemongrass and palmarosa. In the first
four years, intercropping with pineapple, yam
and vegetables can be done.
Harvest and curing
Pruning of side branches may be started
from second year onwards. Lopping at a height
of 2 m is done during third or fourth year and
thereafter lopping is resorted to at half-yearly
intervals leaving only one branch. For
extracting oil, steam distillation is resorted to.
Optimum time for distillation is two hours and
the average recovery of oil is 1.5 – 1.8 per
cent of the net weight of leaves. Wilting of the
cut leaves under shade for 24 hours before
distillation will increase the oil recovery
percentage.
KACHOLAM (Kaempferia galanga)
An attractive medicinal plant used in
various medicines. The aromatic essential oil
of the rhizome is widely used in perfumery, as
a condiment and as a folk medicine. Asians
employ the rhizomes and leaves as a perfume
in cosmetics, hair washes and powders.
Rhizomes are used to protect the
clothing against insects and are chewed with
betel nut.
Kacholam is a plant adapted for tropical
climate. Fertile loamy soil having good
drainage is ideal for the crop. Laterite soil with
heavy organic manure application is also well
suited.
Preparation of land
Prepare the land to a good tilth during
March by ploughing or digging. On receipt of
239
EUCALYPTUS AND KACHOLAM
pre-monsoon showers in April, prepare beds
of 1 m width 25 cm height and of
convenient length with spacing of 40 cm
between beds.
Seed materials
Whole or split rhizome with at least one
healthy sprout is the planting material in
kacholam. Select well developed healthy and
disease free rhizomes. Rhizomes can be stored
in cool dry place or pits dug under shade,
plastered with mud or cowdung. Two weeks
before planting of the new crop, smoking the
rhizomes by spreading it on Glycosmis
pentaphylla (panal) leaves is practised in
certain localities.
Varieties
Rajani and Kasthuri are high yielding
varieties with an yield potential of more than
2 tonnes dry rhizomes per ha and have good
aroma and flavour. Local types are also under
cultivation.
Season and method of planting
Planting is done during the month of May
with the receipt of pre-monsoon showers. Take
small pits in the beds in rows with a spacing of
20 cm x 15 cm and at a depth of 4-5 cm and
plant rhizomes with at least one viable healthy
bud facing upwards. Adopt seed rate of
700-800 kg ha-1.
Manuring
Apply FYM or compost as basal dose
@ 20 t ha-1, either by broadcasting and
ploughing or by covering the rhizome in pits
after planting. Apply N, P2O5 and K2O @ 50,
50 and 50 kg ha-1 at the time of the first and
second weeding.
Mulching
After planting, mulch the beds with dry or
green leaves @ 15 t ha-1.
After cultivation
Remove weeds as and when necessary.
Apply fertilizers and earth up the crop
during the first and second weeding (45 and
90 days after planting). Avoid water stagnation
in the beds. Further weeding is not necessary
as the spreading leaves smother the soil
surface.
Plant protection
During heavy rains, leaf rot disease
occurs in certain localities. For controlling
this disease, drench the beds with 1 per cent
Bordeaux mixture or thiram 0.2 per cent.
For controlling nematodes (Meloidogyne
incognita and Radopholus similis) associated
with Kacholam, rhizome treatment with
Pseudomonas fluorescense @ 3 per cent
weight by weight of seed material or by green
leaf mulching with neem and glyricidia @ 5kg/
m2 at 30 DAP can be recommended.
Harvesting and curing
The crop can be harvested seven months
after planting. Drying of the leaves is the
indication of crop maturity for harvest.
Harvest the crop carefully without damaging
the rhizomes, remove dried leaves and roots,
wash the rhizome in water and dry. With sharp
knife, chop the rhizomes into circular pieces
of uniform size except the end portion, which
has to be cut separately. Spread the cut
rhizomes uniformly on clean floor and allow
drying for four days. On fourth day, heap the
rhizomes and keep it overnight. On the next
day it is again spread and dried. Clean the dried
produce, bag and store in cool dry place or
market it. Prolonged storage can cause insect
and fungus attack.

LEMONGRASS (Cymbopogon flexuosus)
Lemongrass prefers warm climate with a
well-distributed rainfall and well-drained soil.
Usually it is grown on poor, gravelly soils. Lem-
ongrass is a perennial grass mainly
cultivated on hill slopes as a rainfed crop. The
crop provides maximum yield from the
second to fourth year of planting and
economic yield up to the sixth year.
Thereafter, the yield declines considerably. The
leaves yield an aromatic oil, containing 70-90
per cent citral. The oil is used in soaps,
cosmetics and disinfectants and is a raw
material for manufacturing ionones and
vitamin A.
Seeds and sowing
The crop is propagated mostly through
seeds. It can also be propagated vegetatively
through planting of slips.
Sugandhi is the improved variety of lemon-
grass recommended for cultivation.
Seeds can be sown directly in the field or
seedlings are raised in a nursery and then
transplanted. Transplanted crop is found
superior to direct-sown crop in respect of grass
yield, oil content and citral content in oil. Seeds
are sown in well prepared nursery beds during
April-May with the onset of pre-monsoon rains
and covered with thin layer of soil. The seed
rate is 3 to 4 kg ha-1. Seeds collected in the
season should be sown latest by August of the
same year. The seedlings will be ready for
transplanting in 2 to 2.5 months.
Preparation of land
The land is prepared by digging. Raised beds
of 75-80 cm width and of convenient length
are formed with a spacing of 30-35 cm between
beds. On sloppy terrain, the beds are formed
along the contours. At the early southwest
monsoon (June-July), two or three seedlings
or slips per hill are transplanted on the beds at
a spacing of 15-20 cm in 4-5 rows. Before
planting, the top leafy portion of the seedling is
cut off leaving the plant stalk about 15-20 cm
length.
Manuring
Application of compost made of spent
lemongrass (refuse obtained after distillation)
and wood ash @ 2500 kg ha-1 and 1875 kg ha-
1 respectively is found beneficial. Application
of nitrogenous fertilizers @ 100 kg ha-1 in four
splits (each after 1st to 4th harvest) has been
found to increase oil yield considerably.
After cultivation
Regular weeding depending on weed
growth and earthing up at least once in a year
along with manuring is recommended.
Serious pests or diseases do not generally
infest the crop.
Harvesting
Harvesting is done by cutting the grass
10 cm above ground level. During the first year
of planting, three cuttings are obtained and
subsequently five to six cuttings per year are
taken subject to weather conditions. The
harvesting season begins in May and
continues till the end of January. The first
harvest is taken about 90 days after planting
and subsequent harvests at intervals of
40-50 days. The optimum interval between
harvests to obtain maximum quantity of oil is
40-45 days for local types of lemon grass. For
Sugandhi, the optimum interval was found to
be 60-65 days when grown in hill tops and
45-55 days in valleys and lower areas.
Seed collection
The crop for seed production is left
without cutting to get maximum seeds. The
241
LEMONGRASS
PALMAROSA (Cymbopogon martinii var. motia)
Palmarosa (rosha grass) is adapted to
marginal areas and poor soils. The flowering
tops and foliage contain sweet smelling oil
emitting a rose like odour and is widely used in
soaps, cosmetics and perfumery industries.
The oil is also used as a raw material for
producing geraniol, which is extensively used
in the perfumery industry.
Propagation
The crop can be propagated by seeds and
slips. Seedlings establish quicker and are
better than slips. So seedlings are preferred as
planting materials under Kerala conditions.
Prepare the seedbed in well pulverized soil after
15th April. Seed rate is 4-5 kg ha
-1. Seeds
collected in January-February must be sown
latest by August.
Planting
Prepare the main field for planting, form beds
and plant the seedling, two on a hill, at a
spacing  of 30 cm x 20 cm. Apply  organic
manures like compost made of spent grass and
wood ash @ 6 t ha-1 and 2.5 t ha-1
respectively at the time of formation of beds.
Harvesting
By about 3.5 to 4 months, the plants
attain a height of 150-200 cm and they start
producing inflorescence. The grass is cut one
week after flowering. Generally two cuttings
are made during the first year of planting. From
second year onwards 3 to 5 cuttings are
possible.
crop flowers during November-December and
the seeds are collected during January-
February. The whole panicle is cut and dried
for one or two days and then threshed and
sieved to collect the seeds.
Distillation
Essential oil from lemon grass leaves is
extracted by hydro-steam distillation. Time
required for distillation is two hours including
the time required for charging and discharg-
ing.  A light yellow, lemon scented volatile oil is
obtained.  When crop area is large enough,
steam method is found to be more economi-
cal. Coal is used as fuel.
The cut grass is chopped into smaller pieces
before feeding to the distillation unit. It can be
stored up to 3 days under shade without any
adverse effect on yield or quality of oil.
Storage of oil
Lemongrass oil can be stored up to 3 years
without affecting the quality of oil, if kept in
aluminium containers sealed air-tight using
wax. The containers are to be kept in
darkness.
Yield
The grass yield during the first year
will be about 10 t ha-1, which gives about 28 kg of
oil. From the second year onwards, the grass
yield will be about 25 t ha-1 giving about
75 kg of oil. The average recovery of oil is 0.30-
0.35 per cent with 70 per cent citral for local
types of lemongrass while OD-19 variety gives
0.40-0.45 per cent oil recovery and 85-90 per
cent citral content.
LEMONGRASS AND PALMAROSA
242
Vetiver is a perennial grass, commonly
known as ‘khus’ and mainly cultivated on hill
slopes as a rainfed crop. The essential oil is
extracted from the roots and known as ‘khus
khus oil’.
It prefers a warm climate and grows in
areas up to 600 m elevation. Even though
vetiver grows almost in all soils, a rich and fairly
well drained sandy loam is the best. An annual
rainfall of about 100 to 200 cm,
temperature ranging from 25 to 40ºC and
moderate humidity are ideal for its growth.
Its root contains fragrant oil, which is a
perfume by itself. The dry aromatic roots are
made into curtains, mats, fans, etc. to emit
scented cool aroma when moistened. The oil
is used as a valuable fixative for blending
perfumes and cosmetics.
Varieties
Two types of vetiver namely, South
Indian and North Indian (khus) are
generally under cultivation. South Indian types
produce higher root and oil yield, but North
Indian types have superior oil quality. Among
the South Indian types, the Nilambur type
(ODV-3) 
on 
an 
average 
produces
5 t ha-1 of root, yielding 20-30 kg oil ha-1.
Planting
The crop is propagated through slips. June-
July is the optimum period for planting. Two to
three ploughing are given so that the soil is well
loosened and ridges or beds of convenient
length are made. Slips are planted in two rows
on 1 m wide beds.
Manuring
Usually 5 t ha-1 of FYM or compost is
applied at the time of bed preparation.
Application of 22.5 kg each of P2O5 and
K2O per ha is found to be beneficial for
increasing root and oil yield.
Harvesting and distillation
The optimum period of harvest of
roots to get the maximum oil yield is 18 months.
Harvesting is done with the digging forks. The
roots are washed gently to remove the earth
and are chopped into bits of 4-5 cm length.
The oil is extracted by hydro-distillation.
Vetiver as a soil binder
Vetiver has a deep, dense and strong
fibrous root system. The perennial and
sterile characteristics of the crop with its
hardiness and unpalatability to livestock make
VETIVER (Chrysopogon zizanioides)
Distillation
As in the case of lemongrass, extraction of
palmarosa oil is done by the hydro-steam
method. It takes two hours to complete one
distillation. The average recovery of oil from
ODP-1(Amaravathy type) is 0.40 to 0.45 per
cent. Allowing the cut grass to wilt in shade
for 24 hours during monsoon season and 48
hours during the post-monsoon will increase
the oil recovery.
Plant protection
Pink globular root aphids (Tetraneura)
occur on the roots and cause withering
of the crop in patches due to desapping.
Dig out and burn the affected patches and
irrigate with water charged with fish oil
soap or emulsion spray oil to control the aphids.

NEELA AMARI [NILI] (Indigofera tinctoria)
Nili is a reputed drug for the promotion of
hair growth. Due to antitoxic property it is also
a good remedy for poisons. This plant, which
is the original source of natural indigo, is an
erect shrub with imparipinnate leaves. Leaves
This is an attractive erect rambling
shrub with long tuberous roots and bright red
flowers in long terminal spikes. The root
tubers are the medicinally important parts. This
is an esteemed remedy for leucoderma and
other skin diseases. The synonyms of fire like
‘agni’, ‘analah’ etc. are attributed to this drug
to indicate the caustic action of roots causing
blisters on the skin. The drug is used only after
adequate curing and purification. Roots
 contain plumbagin, which is responsible for the
therapeutic action of the drug.
Varieties: Mridhula and Agni.
Planting materials
Propagated by single, double or three node
semi-hard wood stem cuttings. Cuttings are
planted in nursery beds of convenient length
and 1 m width for rooting.
Land preparation
Prepare the land to a good tilth by plough-
ing two or three times. Make ridges of about
30 cm height and 50 cm apart for planting
rooted cuttings. Two to three month old rooted
cuttings can be planted on the ridges at a
spacing of 15 cm in June-July.
Manuring
Cattle manure or compost @ 10 t ha-1
may be applied as basal dose at the time
of land preparation. The fertilizer dose
for 
chethikoduveli 
is 
N:P2O5:K2O
50:50:50 kg ha-1. Entire P2O5 has to be
applied as basal dose and N and K2O in two
split doses, 2 months and 4 months after
planting.
After cultivation
Weeding has to be done two or three times
depending on weed growth. Earthing up may
be done two times along with topdressing of
fertilizers.
For controlling nematodes (Meloidogyne
incognita 
and

CHENGAZHINIRKIZHANGU (Kaempferia rotunda)
Seeds and sowing
Seeds are very small and the seed rate is
3 kg ha-1. Seeds require pretreatment for good
germination, as the seed coat is hard. Seeds
are mixed with sand and ground gently to break
the seed coat. An alternate method for
enhancing germination is dipping the seeds in
boiling water for a second. After pre-treatment
seeds are broadcasted. Broadcast the seeds
preferably mixed with sand 2-3 times its volume
to ensure uniform coverage. Seeds germinate
within a week. Alternatively, 1 to 1.5 months
old seedlings raised on beds or in polybags
can be transplanted at a spacing of
45 cm x 30 cm.
Seasons
The best time for sowing is September-
October.
Manuring
Apply cattle manure @ 10 t ha-1 as basal
dressing and incorporate into soil along with
last ploughing.

and six weeks after sowing.
Harvesting
Plants start flowering 2-3 months after
sowing. Harvesting is done by cutting the plants
at this time, at a height of about  20 cm from
ground level. Irrigate plants after harvest.
Subsequent harvests can be made at 1.5 – 2
months interval. Four to five cuttings can be
taken in a year depending on the growth.
Seed collection
A few plants per plot are left without
cutting to set seeds. Ripe pods are to be
harvested in the early morning to prevent loss
of seeds by shattering during harvest.
Pests
The psyllid Arytaina puctipennis infest top
shoot causing curling up and drooping of leaves
and shoots and wilting of plants.

Land preparation
Plough the field to good tilth. Incorporate
organic manure at 10-15 t ha-1. Prepare raised
seed beds of 1 m breadth and of
convenient length.
Seed rate
Use rhizome bits of size 10-15 g for
planting. About 2500-3000 kg rhizomes are
required for planting one hectare. Smoking the
rhizomes for 2-3 weeks is good for the devel-
opment of healthy sprouts. At times,
rhizomes are stored in Glycosmis pentaphylla
leaves in underground pits covered with
coconut fronds.
Planting
Pits are made at 20 cm spacing on the seed
bed. Whole or split rhizomes with at least one
healthy sprout is planted 5 cm deep with the
sprout facing upwards and covering the pit with
FYM.
Mulching
Mulch the beds thickly with green leaves
or straw @ 15 t ha-1 immediately after
planting and again after two months along
with weeding and topdressing. Mulching is
absolutely essential for good growth.
Fertilizer application
Fertilizer application can be skipped in
fertile soils. In poor and marginal soils a
moderate dose of 50:50:50 N:P2O5:K2O kg ha-1
may be applied; P2O5 as basal and N and K2O
in two or three split doses.
After cultivation

at least one shoot is the planting material,
which is required @ 1000-1500 kg ha-1.
Planting
Take small pits on the seedbed and plant 5
cm long rhizome bits. Cover rhizome with
FYM and mulch the seedbed with leaves or
straw. The optimum spacing is 40 cm x 30 cm
under good fertility and 30 cm x 20 cm
under poor fertility conditions.
Fertilizer application
Apply fertilizers @ 100:50:50 N:P2O5:
K2O kg ha-1 per year in two or three split doses.
Application of biofertilizer Azospirillum @ 10
kg ha-1 and in situ green manuring with
cowpea are beneficial for the crop.
After cultivation
Carry out gap filling, if required, within one
month; remove weeds two months after
planting followed by topdressing, earthing up
and mulching. Thereafter no weeding is
required as the crop smothers the weeds.
Plant protection
Usually pests and diseases are not
serious enough to take up any control
measures. Occasionally shoot borers and leaf
eating caterpillars are observed. Blight
disease can be controlled by spraying 1 per
cent Bordeaux mixture.
Harvesting and yield
Though the crop can be harvested after 18
months, the optimum stage of harvest for
obtaining maximum rhizome and oil yield is
36-42 months after planting. Cut and remove
the shoot portion and carefully dig out the
rhizomes and roots. Harvesting is very
arduous due to strong and extensive root
ramification. Separate the roots, clean the
rhizomes and cut into 5 cm long pieces, which
are dried in the sun for 3-5 days to
10 per cent moisture for marketing. The
average yield of rhizomes is about 23 t ha-1,
which on drying gives 25 per cent recovery.
Processing
The fresh rhizomes on steam distillation for
3-5 hours give 0.22 per cent essential oil. The
oil recovery on dry weight basis is
0.93 per cent.

rejuvenating and aphrodiasic drug. It
improves complexion and is useful in
general debility, deafness, cough, asthma, piles,
skin diseases, impotency, jaundice, urinary
disorders etc. It is an ingredient of ayurvedic
formulations like Vidaryadighrita, Vidaryati
lehya, Murma gulika, Musalyadi churna, etc.
Climate and soil
The plant is found through out India from
near sea level to 2300 m altitude, particularly
in rock crevices and laterite soil. It grows well
in moist humus – rich soils especially in shady
forest areas and rubber plantations. It is a
shade loving plant and its growth, yield and
quality are optimum under 25 percent shade.
It can be grown as an under story crop or
intercrop in plantations.
Propagation
The plant is propagated through rhizome.
New propagules also emerge from leaf tips in
contact with soil during monsoon.

JEEVAKOM (Seidenfia rheedii Sw. Szkch)
Jeevakom is a medicinal orchid widely used
in Ayurveda. It is available in the market in
two forms. ‘Jeevakom’ and “Edavakom’.
Jeevakom belongs to the ‘astavarga’ group of
drugs mentioned in Ayurveda. It is a short-
stemmed fibrous rooted lithophytic herb with
5-7 leaves. Stem is swollen at the base forming
a conical pseudo balbil which is the part used
in medicine. Jeevakom is a rejuvenating drug
and an ingredient of many Ayurvedic
formulations viz. Chavanaprash, Dhanwa-
ntharam kashayam, Dhanwantharam
kuzhambu and Ashtavargam kashayam.
Climate and soil
The plant is present in select pockets of
India, mainly in the forests. In Kerala it occurs
at altitudes ranging from 650 to 1000 m above
MSL. In the forests jeevakom colonizes on
decomposed organic matter on wet rocks
amidst moss and grass. It is a shade loving
plant and prefers 50%-75% shade for better
growth, yield and quality. The crop can be
grown under natural as well as artificial shade
provided by shade net.
Propagation
The plant is propagated through
pseudo- bulbils. Mother bulbils cut into single
node bits can also be used.
Varieties
Only local cultivars (ecotypes) are available
for cultivation.
Season
Crop is raised as rainfed. Best time for
planting is after the receipt of summer showers
(May-June).
Land preparation
Select an area receiving 50-75 percent
shade (natural or artificial shade provided by
shade net). Plough the field to good tilth.
Incorporate dried FYM at the rate of 20t/ha-1.
Prepare raised beds of convenient length and
breadth to facilitate drainage.
Seed rate
Stored pseudobulbils of previous year are
used as planting material. Small side bulbils
weighing 1 g or mother bulbils cut into 2g bits
having single node can be used. Seed rate is
250 kg/ha-1.
Planting
Bulbils are planted at a spacing of
10x10 cm. Bulbils are placed horizontally over
the beds, they are just pressed gently into the
soil. Beds are mulched heavily after planting
with green or partially decomposed dry leaves.
Manuring
Crop responds well to organic manures.
Powdered FYM/leaf compost/vermicompost
is applied @ 100g/m2, 60 days and 90 days
after planting.
After cultivation
Carry out gap filling if any within 30 days.
Remove the weeds as and when they come
harvested for rhizome.  During summer, the
above ground portion dries up. Harvesting is
done by digging out the rhizomes.  The shoot
portion and the roots are removed and the
separated rhizomes are cleaned. Fresh rhizome
yield is 3-4 t ha-1.  Rhizomes are sliced to 1cm
size, dried in sun and marketed or stored in
gunny bags.  The dried rhizome yield is 1-1.5 t
ha-1 (35-45 per cent driage). Higher yield is
obtained if harvested during second year.

condition. Cover the soil with mulch for the
first 4-5 months, keep the soil moist always.
Crop flowers 1-2 months after planting. Side
bulbils start emerging from 4th month
onwards.
Harvesting and yield
After six months of planting, aerial parts
start yellowing. Leaves turn yellow and
ultimately dry up. Bulbils are gathered from
ADAPATHIYAN (Holostemma adakodien)
Holostemma or Adapathiyan is a large,
glabrous, laticiferous twining shrub, much
branched, with shining stem and large
conspicuous flowers.  Root is the economic
part. It is useful in ophthalmopathy, orchitis,
cough, burning sensation, stomachalgia
constipation, fever and tridoshas.  It is used
in preparations of Vidaryadi ganam,
Dhanwandharam thaila, Manasa mithra
vatakam, Balarishta and Anuthaila.  It is also
useful in eye diseases and it imparts resistance
to diseases.
It grows on a wide range of climate and
soil.  Well-drained hilly areas with an
underlying hard pan is good for its cultivation.
Fertile red loams to forest soils are suitable.
Propagation
The plant is propagated vegetatively by stem
cuttings and by seeds. The seeds are collected
from the plant in November-December before
being dispersed. Seeds are cleaned, dried and
stored for sowing.  The stored seeds after
soaking in water for 4-5 hours are sown on
seedbeds.  About one month old seedlings are
planted in polybags,  which are kept in shade
and irrigated.  About 1–1.5 month old seedlings
are ready for transplanting.
Varieties
Jeeva is a high yielding variety. It has purple
colored stem with a yield of 4.5 t ha-1 of fresh
tubers.
At present, only local varieties are available
for cultivation.
Seasons
Rainfed crop is planted with the onset of
monsoon in May-June. Irrigated crop can be
planted any time.
Land preparation
Plough the field to good tilth.  Remove all
pebbles and stones.  Incorporate FYM or
organic manure at 20 t ha-1.
Planting
Pits of 30 cm3 size are taken at a spacing
of 60 cm x30 cm distance and filled with 10 kg
dried cowdung and top soil and formed into a
mound.  Seedlings are transplanted on to the
mounds from the polybags carefully.
the beds manually. Bulbils covered with the
leaf sheaths are separated, roots removed.
Mother and daughter bulbils are separated.
Since the part used as drug and the propagule
are one and the same, the mother bulbils are
used as drug and the side bulbils can be used
as planting material for next season.Total yield
from a bed is 6.0 kg/3m2. The bulbils which
are succulent in mature can be stored in
earthern containers in a cool room for a period
of 4-5 months without loosing viability.

KANJIRAM (Strychnos nux-vomica)
Strychnos or kanjiram is a large
deciduous tree with a fairly straight and
cylindrical bole having dark grey or
yellowish grey bark and minute tubercles.
Strychnos is highly toxic to man and animals
producing stiffness of muscles and
convulsions, ultimately leading to death.  In
small doses it can serve as efficacious cure
for paralysis and other nervous disorders.
Root and root bark is used in fever and
dysentery.
Climate and soil
The plant is distributed throughout India in
deciduous forests up to 1200 m. It prefers
tropical and subtropical climate.  It is grown in
different soil types such as laterite, sandy and
alluvial.
Propagation
It is propagated through seeds. Germination
can be substantially increased by treating the
seeds with hot water (500 C) for a period of
six to twelve hours prior to sowing.
Season
Seedlings can be planted in main field with
the onset of South-West monsoon in
May – June.
Planting
Seeds are sown in poly bags. The saplings
are later transplanted to the main field on to
pits of about 1m x 1m taken at a spacing of
6m x 6m, filled with top soil and organic
manure.
After cultivation
The basins of the trees are cleared of weeds
and after application of manures and fertilizers
covered with soil.  FYM at 2 kg per tree is to
be applied during early stages and the dose is
gradually increased to 20kg from 5th year
onwards.
Plant protection
No serious pests or diseases are generally
noted in this crop.
After cultivation
The base of the trees is to be cleared of
weeds and FYM at 2 kg/tree/year may be
applied twice; first in May-June and again in
October-November. The dose is to be
increased gradually to 10 kg from 5th year
onwards. Chemical fertilizers are not
usually applied. However its application
during the initial years will help in better
establishment of the plant.  NPK at 90:45:45 g/
tree/year is recommended.
Plant protection
No serious pests or diseases are generally
noted in this crop.
Harvesting and yield
Asoka can be cut after 20 years for
collection of bark, the medicinally useful part.
It is cut at a height of 15 cm from soil level.  If
irrigation and fertilizers are given the stump
will produce new shoots and it can be
harvested again after 5 years.  Alternatively,
the bark can be collected without cutting
down the tree. The bark is peeled off first,
vertically from one side of the main trunk.  The
excised area is renewed with fresh bark in
1-2 years. Then, the bark on the other side
can be peeled off. The process can be continued
over years.

FODDER  CROPS
GUINEA GRASS (Panicum maximum)
Guinea grass is a popular fodder grass of
the tropics suited to the agro-climatic
conditions of Kerala. It can be profitably grown
as a component of agro-forestry systems and
comes up well under coconut and other trees.
As an excellent fodder it is much valued for its
high productivity, palatability and good
persistence.
It is a perennial bunch grass, 0.5 to 4.5 m
high. The stem is stout to slender, erect or
ascending, glabrous or hairy. Leaves are 10 to
100 cm long and 3.5 cm wide. Panicle loose
and much branched, the lower most branches
being in a distinct whorl. The small seeds are
enclosed in smooth glumes. The seeds shatter.
The root system is deep, dense and fibrous.
The important varieties are Makueni,
Riversdale, Hamil, PGG-4, FR-600, Haritha,
Marathakom and Harithasree. Makueni is a
drought resistant cultivar suited to rainfed
situations in the state.
Guinea grass thrives well in warm moist
climate. It can grow from sea level to 1800 m
altitude. It is frost sensitive. It thrives
between a temperature range of 15 to 38ºC.
The grass tolerates shade and grows under
trees and bushes and is best suitable as an
intercrop in coconut gardens. The grass is
adapted to a wide range of soils. It usually
grows on well-drained light textured soil,
preferably sandy loams or loams, but is
better suited to medium to highly fertile loams.
It cannot tolerate heavy clays or prolonged
waterlogging.
Under Kerala conditions, the best season
of planting is with the onset of south west
monsoon during May-June. As an irrigated
crop planting can be done at any time of the
year.
Seeds and slips can be used as planting
material. Since seed germination is poor
vegetative propagation is preferred. To
obtain slips for planting, old clumps are
uprooted and slips with roots are separated.
For planting one hectare, 1.25 lakhs of slips
are required. If seeds are used (3 kg ha-1), it
should be sown in nursery and the seedlings
transplanted in the main field.
The grass requires thorough cultivation to
prepare a weed-free seedbed for establishment.
For this, two or three ploughings and one
levelling are sufficient. In the prepared field,
trenches of 10 cm width and 20 cm depth are
made. In these trenches, FYM should be
applied along with phosphorus and potassium
fertilizers. Mix with soil and cover the trenches
and form ridges of 15 cm height for planting
slips. In acid soils, application of lime @ 500
kg ha-1 in alternate years is desirable.
Slips are planted on ridges @ three
slips per hill. The spacing of 40 cm x 20 cm is
followed when grown as an intercrop.
For a pure crop, a wider spacing of 60 cm x 30
cm is required.
A basal dose of 10 tonnes of FYM, 50 kg
P2O5 and 50 kg K2O ha-1 (applied in trenches)
is recommended. For top dressing, use 200 kg
N ha-1 in two split doses, the first dose
immediately after first cutting and the second
dose during the northeast monsoon period. If
irrigation facilities are available, topdressing can

The grass is a tufted perennial with erect
stems and grows 1-2 m in height. Leaves are
be given in more splits. The fertilizer may be
applied 
on
either side of the plants, along the row and
earthed up.
At planting two irrigations are required
within seven to ten days for quick
establishment. The crop should be subsequently
irrigated depending upon the rainfall and soil
type. Usually irrigation once in 7-10 days is
required. Irrigation with cowshed washing or
sewage water within 3-4 days after cutting
gives better growth.
The delicate seedlings or newly emerged
shoots from slips or cuttings require
protection from weeds in the first
two 
months. 
Two 
intercultivations
should be given during this period. Later,
intercultivation may be necessary after three
or four cuttings.
The crop is ready for harvest when it
reaches 1.5 m height. Cutting at 15 to 20 cm
above the ground level is advised. The first
cut is usually ready in 9-10 weeks after
planting and subsequent cuts are taken at
45 to 60 days intervals. About six to seven
harvests can be made in a year.
Approximately 80-100 t ha-1 of green
fodder is obtained per year.
Guinea grass can be grown mixed with
leguminous fodder crops such as cowpea, stylo
and siratro.
The grass is nutritious, palatable and free
from oxalates. It makes good hay and silage.
The crude protein and the crude fibre content
of this grass vary from 8 to 14 per cent and 28
to 36 per cent respectively.
GAMBA GRASS (Andropogon gayanus)
Gamba grass is also known as ‘Sadabahar’.
It is a tufted perennial grass and the stems are
usually 1-2 m high. The inflorescence is a large
spathe or panicle.
The grass tolerates drought and suits
areas where dry season lasts for five months
or so. In areas with less severe drought it can
remain green throughout the year. It
tolerates deep seasonal flooding. The grass
avoids heavy soil, is resistant to grass fires and
develops new leaves and shoots a few days
after burning. The crop comes up well in partial
shade and is a good intercrop in coconut
gardens. The crop can be propagated through
rooted slips or seeds lightly drilled.
Cultural operations and management are
similar to that of guinea grass.
In general about 50 to 80 t ha-1 of green
matter is produced in the first year. From the
second year onwards there is a slight increase in
green fodder yield. The grass has excellent
palatability with 5.5 per cent crude protein
and 32.6 per cent crude fibre.
261
GUINEA GRASS, GAMBA GRASS AND SETARIA GRASS
about 40 cm long, 8-20 cm wide and green to
dark green in colour. Panicle is dense,
cylindrical, about 10 to 30 cm long and
orange to purplish in colour. Spikelets are
two in number, the lower one is the male or
sterile and the upper one is bisexual.
Usually the grass grows under an annual
rainfall of over 750 mm. It grows vigorously
under high annual rainfall ranging from
1000 to 1500 mm. It can also survive long, hot
and dry seasons.The grass grows well at 20 to
25oC. It is more cold tolerant than most of
other tropical and subtropical grasses. It can
come up in a variety of  soil types.
This perennial grass requires thorough land
preparation; two or three ploughings/diggings
followed by one levelling. The land should be
free from weeds.
Propagation is through rooted slips as well
as through seeds. Seedlings can be raised in
nursery and transplanted during rainy
season under rainfed conditions. If irrigation
facilities are available, planting can be
done at any time between February and
November.
As a pure crop it is planted at 50 cm x 30
cm spacing. The row-to-row distance may be
increased to 60-70 cm when the soil is poor
and irrigation facility is absent. For
intercropping with legumes, 100 cm x 30 cm
spacing is followed. If seeds are used, seed
rate varies from 3.5 to 4.0 kg ha-1. In case of
rooted slips, the number of slips required
varies from 33500 to 67000 per ha. Organic
manure, either FYM or compost @ 10 t ha-1
may be applied at the time of land
preparation. The crop responds well to
application of fertilizers especially N. The
fertilizer requirement depends on the initial
nutrient status of the soil.
The grass flourishes in moist, but not wet
soils. Setaria plots should be well drained during
rainy season. At establishment, the crop
requires two successive light irrigations in
7-10 days interval. Subsequent irrigation should
be given as and when necessary.
One or two weeding or intercultivation
is given in the first 2 to 3 months. To control
weeds and to encourage fresh sprouts, one
or two intercultivation has to be carried out
every year.
The crop is ready for harvest by 9-10
weeks. Subsequent cuts can be taken after
every 40 to 60 days depending on the crop
growth. At harvest, a stubble height of about
8 to 10 cm is left for good regeneration.
Generally, about 25-40 t ha-1 of green
fodder can be harvested per year under
rainfed situation. Irrigated crop yields about
75-150 t ha-1 per year.
The grass can be used as green cut
fodder, silage and hay. The grass gives
satisfactory silage with molasses. The crude
protein and crude fibre content of the grass
range from 4.8 to 18.4 per cent and 24 to 34
per cent respectively.
Seed yields are low due to prolonged
emergence of panicles, prolonged flowering of
the same panicle, early shedding of
spikelets, bird damage etc. Denser stands give
more uniform panicle emergence than widely
spaced plants. Fertilizer application is
compulsory in seed production.
SETARIA GRASS
262
HYBRID NAPIER (Pennisetum typhoides x P. purpureum)
Napier grass is also called as elephant grass
due to its tallness and vigorous vegetative
growth. The plants tiller freely and a single
clump may produce 50 tillers under favourable
climatic and soil conditions. Unfortunately, the
grass is coarse-textured, the leaf blade and
sheaths hairy, leaf margins sharply toothed and
stems less juicy and fibrous. In 1953, a cross was
made in India with bajra which is more
succulent, leafy, fine textured, palatable, fast
growing and drought resistant than Napier to
combine these qualities with its high yielding
potential.
Compared to Napier grass, Hybrid Napier
produces more tillers and numerous leaves. It
grows faster and produces more herbage but
the stems are hard and the plants less persistent.
Pusa Giant Napier has larger leaves, softer and
less persistent hairs on leaf blades and sheaths
and less sharp leaf edges. The stems are also
less fibrous than Napier. The tillers are more
numerous and grow faster.
The grass grows throughout the year in the
tropics. The optimum temperature is about
31oC. Light showers alternated with bright
sunshine are very congenial to the crop. Total
water requirement of the grass is about
800-1000 mm. Hybrid Pennisetum can grow
on a variety of soils. Light loams and sandy
soils are preferred to heavy soils. The grass
does not thrive well on waterlogged and flood
prone lands. Phenomenal yields are obtained
from very deep fertile soil rich in organic
matter. It tolerates pH ranging from 5 to 8.
Hybrid Napier requires a deep, thorough
weed free and compact seedbed. Three or four
ploughings followed by disc harrowing is ideal.
The popular hybrids are Pusa Giant Napier,
Gajraj, NB-5, NB-6, NB-21,  NB-35, Suguna
and Supriya.
Planting is done with the onset of southwest
monsoon. Being a sterile hybrid, the grass is
planted by rooted slips or by stem cuttings.
Cuttings of moderately mature stems (3 months
old) and preferably from the lower two thirds
of the stem length sprout better than the older
stems. The cuttings with three nodes are stuck
into the soil with the basal end down, either
vertically or at an angle to such a depth that
two nodes remain within the soil and one above
the soil surface. The under ground nodes
develop roots and shoots while the upper ones
develop shoots only.
A spacing of 60 cm x 60 cm is recom-
mended for pure crop of Hybrid Napier. In
intercropping system, spacing is adjusted to
accommodate the companion crops. The
planting rate depends upon the spacing and the
weight of the cuttings or rooted slips used. It is
modified in crop mixtures or intercropping with
other forage crops.
Farm yard manure @ 25 t ha-1 and P2O5
and K2O @ 50 kg ha-1 each may be applied at
the time of land preparation. Apply N @ 200
kg ha-1 in two or three split doses
followed by gentle raking, if possible.
The field should be provided with good
drainage during the rainy season, as the
crop cannot withstand water stagnation.
Frequency of irrigation depends upon the
rainfall and weather conditions.
Early intercultivation once or twice
is necessary before the plants establish and
grow vigorously. Subsequently, intercultivation
should be given as and when necessary.
263
HYBRID NAPIER
PARA GRASS (Brachiaria mutica)
This grass is also known as buffalo grass,
water grass, Angola grass and Mauritius grass.
The crop responds well to sewage irrigation
and is usually grown near large sewage disposal
farms.
It is a coarse, trailing perennial that
spreads by surface runners which root
profusely at the nodes with flowering stems
1 to 2 m high. The culms are erect, leafy, hollow,
succulent and glabrous with hairy nodes. The
leaf blades are dark green in colour, 25 to
30 cm long and 1 to 2 cm broad. Inflorescence
is a panicle. Flowering is hastened in shorter
photoperiods.
The grass prefers hot and humid climate of
the tropics and subtropics with high annual
rainfall ranging between 1000 and 1500 mm.
It can withstand short term flooding and
waterlogging but cannot be grown in dryland
in arid and semi-arid regions. It is sensitive to
cold. It makes no growth during winter months.
The grass grows in moist, but not in highly
wet soils. It thrives best on highly fertile clay
loam to clayey textured soils with high
moisture retention capacity. It can be grown
even on sandy soils with good irrigation
facility. It tolerates slightly acid to alkaline soils.
It is highly tolerant to saline or sodic soil
conditions. It grows well on field bunds, banks
of streams and canals, lowlands and soils too
wet for normal farm crops.
Prepare the land thoroughly by three or four
ploughings and remove weeds.
Planting can be done at any time other than
The first cut is taken 9-10 weeks after
planting. Subsequent cuts are taken after four
to six weeks or when the plant attains a height
of 1.5 m. Annually at least six to eight cuts are
possible. In order to encourage quicker
regeneration from the basal buds, stubbles of
10-15 cm is left out at harvest.
Green fodder yield ranges 200-250 t ha-1
per year from 6-8 cuttings.
The grass can be intercropped with
legumes such as cowpea, Calapogonium,
Centrosema and Glycine. Intercropping with
legumes improves the quality of fodder.
Hybrid Napier is superior in quality than
Napier grass and contains about 10.2 per cent
crude protein and 30.5 per cent crude fibre.
The leaves are larger and greener, the sheaths
are softer and the margins less serrated and
hence the herbage is more palatable. It is juicier
and succulent at all stages of growth. It is less
fibrous and more acceptable. The oxalate
content of some of the varieties may be high.
It can be mitigated if harvested at longer
intervals (45 to 60 days).
The grass is ideal for green fodder, silage
and hay.
The fodder may be cut into pieces using a
chaff cutter and ensiled. Legume fodders may
be mixed with the grass in the ratio of 1:2 to
produce balanced silage. The fodder can also
be converted into hay during the dry summer
periods. The chaffed material is exposed in the
sun by spreading uniformly  for a day. Further
drying is done under the shade to preserve
colour. The quality of the silage or hay remains
more or less the same as green fodder.

CONGOSIGNAL GRASS (Brachiaria ruziziensis)
winter months. The rainfed crop is planted with
the first monsoon showers.
Stem cuttings or pieces of creeping shoots
15 to 30 cm long with about three joints are
generally planted in a slanting position. In order
to save time and labour, the planting materials
are scattered in the field and covered by
ploughing crosswise during monsoon season.
Seeds can also be used for direct sowing or
sowing in nursery for transplantation. However,
poor seed setting usually discourages seed
propagation.
Slips can be planted 50 to 60 cm apart both
ways between plants and rows. The growing
runners quickly root at the joints, tiller profusely
and cover the field.
The requirement of slips for planting ranges
from 27000 to 40000 per ha. The seed rate
recommended is 2.5 to 3.5 kg ha-1.
The crop is highly responsive to irrigation
with cattle-shed washing or sewage water.
Apply 40 tonnes of FYM or compost along
with 30 kg P2O5 and 30 kg K2O per ha as
basal dose. Topdressing N 40 kg ha-1 after
each harvest is found to enhance the forage
production.
Two or three light irrigations are to be
provided for the initial establishment of the crop.
Later on, irrigation once in 10 to 15 days in
summer is advantageous.
The land should be kept weed free for the
first two months. Since it is a sturdy and
aggressive grass, once it gets established, the
weeds that appear later are suppressed.
The competitive vigour of para grass
interferes with the co-existence of legumes.
First harvest is done about three months
after planting when the grass attains a height
of about 60 to 75 cm. Subsequent cuts are
taken at 30 to 40 days interval. Annual yield of
about 70 t ha-1  is obtained.
As para grass herbage dries slowly when
cut, it is not suitable for hay-making. However,
it can be used for ensiling. It is a nutritious
high yielding and palatable forage grass. The
grass appears to be free of any toxic effect.
Nutritive value is comparatively less. The crude
protein ranges from 2.8 to 16.1 per cent and
crude fibre from 28 to 34 per cent.
Seed yields are generally low. It is observed
that shorter or longer day lengths hasten
flowering. The correct stage of harvest is soon
after the end of anthesis. Germination is
affected if the seed is harvested late. There is
no post-harvest dormancy for seed.
Congosignal can be grown as a sole crop
in open areas and as an intercrop in coconut
gardens. It is a creeping perennial with dense
foliage and therefore can be used for soil
conservation purpose as strip crop. It grows
to a height of about 50 to 100 cm and
produces 30 to 40 tillers on an average.
It prefers a warm moist tropical climate. It
can be grown in almost all types of soils but
cannot tolerate waterlogging. It also
tolerates shade. So it is recommended as an
intercrop in coconut garden. It can be grown
either as a pure crop or mixed with other
grasses and legumes.
The crop is generally planted in May-June
and September-October with the onset of rains.
Prepare the land by ploughing one or two
times, removing weeds and levelling. Both

FODDER TREES
SUBABUL (Leucaena leucocephala)
Subabul is also known as leucaena or
ipil-ipil. It had its origin from Mexico and is
now widely spread throughout the tropical and
subtropical countries of the world.
It is a perennial hardy evergreen shrub. It
has deep and strong taproot and even the
seedlings are deep rooted. The leaves are
bipinnate, 15 to 20 cm long with 10 to 15 pairs
of pinnate leaves. Inflorescence is globular and
the flowers are white. There are four types of
subabul as described below.
Hawaiian type: The plants are short bushy
and remarkably drought tolerant. It is suited to
hilly terrains in drought prone areas. It is a
prolific seed producer and is good for
fodder purpose. K-341 is a Hawaiian variety.
Salvador type: Tall, tree like and fast
growing having maximum annual biomass
production. Possesses large leaves, pods and
seeds than Hawaiian types. Responds to high
fertilization. Variety K-8 is useful for fodder.
Peru: Tall and extensively branching type and
is ideal for fodder purpose.
Cunningham: It is a cross between Salvador
and Peru types.
Subabul is best suited for warm regions
and grows well between 22 and 30ºC in
regions of 500 to 2000 mm annual rainfall.
Because of its strong and deep root system,
the tree is highly drought resistant. It is
restricted to elevations below 500 m but it
withstands variations in rainfall, sunlight,
windstorm, slight frost and drought. It
cannot withstand waterlogging. It requires a
deep well drained neutral soil and can
tolerate saline and acid soil. It can also be
grown in steep slopes, hilly terrains, gravelly
areas and sandy loams.
Planting of seedlings can be done with the
onset of rains in May-June or September-
October.
Seed viability is high, but possess
dormancy because of hard seed coat. To hasten
germination seeds are to be dipped in
concentrated sulphuric acid for four minutes
and then washed or put in hot water at 80ºC
for four minutes. Sundry the seeds afterwards
for about one hour before sowing.
seeds and slips can be used. A seed rate of
2-5 kg ha-1 is recommended. For sowing, a fine
seedbed is required and seeds are broadcast
at 1-2 cm depth. To protect the seeds from
ants, dusting carbaryl 5 per cent DP at the
time of sowing is effective. When slips are
used, they are planted at a spacing of 40 cm x
20 cm.
Basal application of 5 t ha-1 of FYM along
with 50 kg ha-1 each of P2O5 and K2O is
recommended. Nitrogen @ 100-150 kg ha-1
may be applied in two or three splits.
Intercultivation during early growth stages
is advisable to check weed growth.
It can also be grown as a crop mixture with
leguminous fodder crops.
The first harvest can be done 50 days
after planting and subsequently at 30-40 days
interval. Rainfed crop yields about 35-45 t ha-1
of green fodder whereas the yield will be
increased to about 50-100 t ha-1 under
irrigated conditions.
CONGOSIGNAL GRASS AND SUBABUL
266
AGATHI (Sesbania grandiflora)
The outstanding feature is its extremely fast
growth rate, especially during the first three to
four years. Average wood yield of 20 to 25 m3
per ha is commonly achieved. It is easy to
propagate by direct seeding. Prolific
nodulation and extremely large nodules are
A seed rate of 3-4 kg ha-1 is recommended.
Sowing is preferably done during February-
March in a nursery or polythene bags or in
situ at 2-3 cm depth. Give irrigation if there is
no rain. Seedlings (1.5 to 3 months old with
6-8 leaves) are planted in the main field. A spacing
of 1 m x 0.1 m is recommended for a pure
crop of fodder, 1.5 m x 0.2 m for planting in
boundaries and borders of coconut gardens and
2 m x 0.2 m when raised along boundaries.
It can grow under a wide range of
conditions as a range plant, roadside plant, in
pastures etc. The land should, however, be
cleared of bushes, ploughed and levelled
before sowing.
A basal application of N:P2O5:K2O @
20:50:30 kg ha-1 is recommended.
Since the early growth of the crop is slow,
the tender plants are to be protected from
aggressive weeds. Two or three inter-row
cultivation is essential to check weeds in early
life. Once established, even vigorous grasses
seldom smother the plants.
Leucaena combines well with many
grasses like guinea, pangola, dinanath, Hybrid
Napier etc.
Subabul is a highly nutritious leguminous tree
fodder with 27-34 per cent protein. The fodder is
rich in carotene and vitamin A. Pro vitamin A
content is the highest among all plant species.
The foliage contains an uncommon amino acid,
mimosine, which is toxic to non-ruminants at levels
of about 10 per cent of the diet.
Subabul starts flowering at 125-150 days
after planting. First cutting is done after
5-6 months at a height of 70-80 cm from the
ground level at a time when the plants reach a
height of 1.5-1.75 m. Subsequent harvests
can be made at 50-60 days interval depending
on the re-growth. When planted in boundaries,
the main shoot is not cut; only side branches
are cut for fodder, leaving the top three
branches.
In gravelly soil and in low rainfall areas, a
yield of 25-30 tonnes per ha per year may be
obtained. The irrigated crop may produce
100 t ha-1 of green fodder per year in seven to
eight cuttings.
HEDGE LUCERNE (Desmanthus virgatus)
It is a small shrub, 2 to 3 m tall and roughly
resembles leucaena. It is a native of tropics
and subtropics of the new world, palatable,
aggressive, persistent and tolerant to
heavy grazing. It has 22 per cent protein in
leaves and 10-15 per cent in stems. It is
highly productive, yielding about 40 to
70 tonnes of green fodder per ha per year. No
poisonous principle is observed in the foliage.
Because of its pithy stem, the harvesting is
easier. It is an ideal plant for wasteland
development.

FODDER LEGUMES
FODDER COWPEA (Vigna unguiculata)
Cowpea is the most important leguminous
fodder crop suitable for both summer and rainy
seasons, mainly due to its quick growing habit
and high yielding ability.
Cowpea is indigenous to Africa and
India. It has been cultivated from very early
times for human consumption. Fodder
cowpea can be profitably grown as a
summer crop in rice fallow of sandy loam soils
where water is not available to raise a
subsequent crop. It can be considered as a
complementary crop in the rotation sequence
of rice-rice-cowpea because of the leguminous
organic residues available for fertility
enrichment.
Cowpea is grown as a seasonal crop, which
is  bushy, trailing or climbing. Stems are 1 to 3
m long, glabrous or slightly hairy. Leaves are
trifoliate, inflorescence auxiliary having a few
to several flowers. Pods are linear and
cylindrical.
A number of varieties like Karnataka
local, RS-9, UPC-1956, UPC-5287 and UPC-
9805 are recommended for cultivation for
fodder purpose.
Cowpea is best suited for moderately
humid areas of the tropics and subtropics. It
usually grows in latitude between 30oN and S
and up to 1500 m elevation. The plant
cannot withstand frost, excessive and
prolonged waterlogging, while some varieties
are resistant to heavy rains. The optimum
temperature required for its growth varies from
15 to 27oC. Cowpea can be grown on a wide
range of soils from heavy to sandy loam with
a pH range of 5.0 to 6.5. Saline, alkaline or
waterlogged soils should be avoided. Heavy
clays encourage vegetative growth with less
seed production.
Cowpea for fodder purpose can be grown
in any month if irrigation facilities exist. In
Kerala, it is raised as a rainfed crop during
May and also as summer crop in rice
fallows.
Two to three ploughings are required to
produce a coarse seedbed for the crop.
SHEVRI (Sesbania aegyptica)
It is a promising perennial fodder shrub for
both dry and wet areas. The sub-marginal lands
that are not suited for agricultural
purposes can be used for growing this
fodder plant. The leaves and young twigs form
nutritious forage to animals. The plants can be
sown at a spacing of 100 cm x 50 cm. When
cut at 50 cm height at 60 days
interval, green fodder yield of 12 tonnes per
ha per year can be obtained.
its characteristic features. Cattle relish both
its leaves and pods. After cutting, shoots
re-sprout with vigour. It is not toxic to cattle.
It can be planted very densely @ 3000
stems per ha. It has been viewed as a source
of pulp for paper industry. Leaves contain
36 per cent crude protein. Agricultural crops
continue to grow well when intercropped
with S. grandiflora whose open crown allows
sunlight to pass. It is adapted to the moist
tropics with annual rainfall in excess of
1000 mm.

STYLO (Stylosanthes spp.)
Stylosanthes is a genus of summer
growing perennial pasture / fodder legumes.
Most of its species are native of south and
central America and the Caribbean Islands.
This is a fodder cum leguminous cover crop,
which is suited for intercropping in coconut
gardens, either alone or in combination with
other fodder grasses. The crop controls soil
erosion by giving a protective soil cover.
It also helps to smother weed growth.
The genus Stylosanthes consists entirely
of herbs and small shrubs. Usually they have
a crown of growing points near the soil
surface. This enables the plants to overcome
the excessive damage caused by grazing
animals. They have indehiscent seeds,
regulating dormancy. The seed has hooks for
dispersal through animals. The seeds can also
pass through the digestive system of animals.
In some species due to the presence of
viscid hairs, they are not eaten in some
Shallow furrows at 3 m apart for leading
irrigation water may also be provided. It can
be broadcasted or drilled in lines. For seed
crop, line sowing is preferred. Seed rate
recommended is 40 to 50 kg ha-1  for a
broadcast crop and 15 to 40 kg ha-1 for drill
sown crop. For drilling, spacing of 30 to 40 cm
between rows and 6 to 15 cm between plants
is recommended.
For rainfed crop, at the time of land
preparation, FYM @ 10 t ha-1 is applied and
basal application of N, P2O5 and K2O @ 25,
60 and 30 kg ha-1 is recommended. For
irrigated crop in addition to the basal dose of
40: 30: 30 kg N: P2O5: K2O ha-1, topdressing
of N and K2O each at 10 kg ha-1 after each
cut is to be given.
A pre-sowing irrigation is important for the
proper germination of the crop. If there is lack
of soil moisture, shallow irrigation at 3-4 cm
depth once in 15 days during summer and once
in a month during post-monsoon period is good.
One or two weeding may be required in
the early growth stages to combat weed
problems. Usually high seed rates are
effective in smothering weeds.
Cowpea is tolerant to moderate shade. So
it can be successfully grown as intercrop with
maize, sorghum, bajra, guinea grass, napier
grass etc. to get high yields. In Kerala
cowpea is also raised as an intercrop in
coconut gardens.
As a fodder crop, the first cutting can be
given 45 days after planting and subsequent
two cuttings at 30 days intervals. A single
cut crop yields 25 to 30 t ha-1 whereas green
matter yield of 40 t ha-1 is obtained from
multi-cut cowpea.
Cowpea is used as fodder crop for green
feeding, hay-making, grazing and also for
ensiling in mixtures with sorghum or maize. The
grains are used as human food as well as
animal feed. Cowpea is also used as green
manure crop and as cover crop in plantations.
The feeding value of cowpea forage is high. It
is superior to other legumes like soybean
because of its low fibre content and
minimum wastage in feeding livestock. It has
about 16 per cent crude protein and 20 per
cent crude fibre.
Cowpea is a self-pollinated short day plant.
The percentage of hard seed is low and viability
under storage lasts for 3 years.

FODDER COWPEA AND STYLO
seasons of the year. The plant thrives well in
light soils due to its deep rooting system.
The crop is suited for growing in warm,
humid tropical climate. It is fairly drought
resistant and shade tolerant. It can be
cultivated in areas receiving less than
1000 mm of rainfall and in less fertile soil, acid
soils, gravelly sandy soils and also in
ill-drained soils.
In humid tropical environments,
S. guianensis thrives very well and can
withstand flood and drought lasting for short
periods. Germination and growth are favoured
at high temperatures.
In less fertile soils like sandy coastal soils,
phosphorus fertilizer should also be added along
with sowing of seeds so as to help the
development of root nodules.
Sowing is to be done with the onset of
southwest monsoon during May-June.
Irrigation is required if there is no proper soil
moisture at the time of sowing.
The following are the perennial types of
stylosanthes, ideally suited for growing in the
state.
Brazilian 
lucerne 
(Stylosanthes
guianensis) : This is used as a pasture legume
in a number of tropical countries; Varieties are
usually erect to semi-erect. They are generally
not profusely branched at the base. It can grow
up to 1.5 m in height, particularly when it gets
support from the associate grasses. The
trifoliate leaves are long, rather narrow and
pointed. The stems are coarse and hairy. In
some of the varieties the leaves are sticky. The
flowers are small and yellow producing single
seeded pods. It does not tolerate shade and
can grow very well in areas receiving 900 to
4000 mm of rainfall. It is very tolerant to low
fertility, but responds well to phosphate and is
sensitive to copper deficiency. Stylo seed
should not be sown below 7 to 13 mm. A seed
rate of 2 kg ha-1  is usually satisfactory.
Although Stylo is usually nodulated by naturally
occurring Rhizobium strains, these however,
will not be as effective as the commercial
strains. The main variety commercially grown
is Schofield. This is an erect variety and very
late in flowering. Other varieties are Cook,
Endeavour and Graham.
Townsville stylo (Stylosanthes humilis) : This
annual type stylo is also found suitable for
growing in Kerala.
Caribbean stylo (Stylosanthes hamata cv.
Verano): This is a short-lived perennial
legume similar to Townsville stylo. It is slow
growing and develops a flat crown under
grazing. Erect stem may grow up to 80 cm.
The stems of Verano are smooth. As against
the bristly stems of Townsville stylo it has a
line of very fine, short white hairs on one side
only. The flowering spike of Verano
produces double seeds; the upper has a reduced
hook about 3 to 5 mm long, while the lower
seed has no hook. Verano combines many of
the virtues of both annuals and perennials.
Shrubby Stylo (Stylosanthes scabra) : This is
a perennial shrub. Its deep root system enables
the plant to remain green even in very dry
season. The recommended varieties of shrubby
stylo are Seca and Fitzroy.
Seeds of stylo are very small. The seed rate
is 2 to 3.5 kg ha-1 when grown as an
intercrop in coconut gardens. For grass
legume mixtures, 1.5 kg ha-1 is sufficient. Seeds
are soaked in water overnight and mixed with
Rhizobium culture before sowing.
Prepare a fine seedbed. Seeds are mixed
with sand when sown as a pure crop or mixed
with grass seeds for mixtures. Seeds are sown
broadcast and covered with thin layer of
soil or dibbled at a spacing of 30 cm

FODDER CEREALS
FODDER MAIZE (Zea mays)
Maize grows best in warm climate where
the day temperature is fairly light. Heavy rains
and dry hot winds are not suitable. Favourable
annual rainfall is 60-100 cm. The crop comes
up well in soils with good drainage and fair
moisture status.
The optimum season for sowing is the
last week of June to second week of
July and September to October. The crop
can be raised throughout the year in areas
where irrigation facilities are available.
The land is ploughed two or three times and
beds and channels are formed. Seeds can be
either broadcasted or dibbled at a spacing of
30 cm between rows and 15 cm between
plants.
Hybrid varieties are Deccan, Ganga-5,
Ganga safed-2, and Ganga-3 and composite
variety Vijay.
Seed rate for broadcasting is 80 kg ha-1 and
for dibbling 40-60 kg ha-1 (to be dibbled at 5-6
cm depth @ two seeds per hole).
FYM @ 10 t ha-1 may be applied at the
time of preparation of land as basal dressing.
N, P2O5 and K2O at the rate of 120, 60 and
40 kg/ha respectively, may be given as
topdressing. Weeding may be done according
to necessity.
First cutting of maize can be taken after
60 days of planting or at the milky stage of the
crop. A second cut can also be taken if there
is sufficient moisture in the soil.
between rows. The depth of sowing should be
5-10 mm. Seeds germinate within a week.
The variety Cook produces seeds well.
A seed rate of 5 kg ha-1 is better for seed
production. Apply phosphorus @ 120 kg and
lime @ 375 kg per ha for maximum yield. For
seed production, irrigate with 33 mm of water
once in 9 days during summer months from
January to March. A total of 10 such irrigations
are required during the period.
Recommended dose of N, P2O5 and K2O
for both annual and perennial stylosanthes are
20, 80 and 30 kg per ha respectively. For
perennial crops, phosphorus @ 80 kg ha-1 and
potash @ 30 kg ha-1 may be applied in
subsequent years. Application of lime
@ 375 kg ha-1 is also recommended in acid soils.
Gap filling may be done 15 days after
sowing. First weeding is given 45 days after
sowing. A second weeding and hoeing may also
be done after the first harvest. Gentle raking of
the interspace after the application of
fertilizers in the subsequent years may be done.
First harvest is taken 3-4 months after
sowing and subsequent harvest at 45 days
intervals or according to the growth of the crop.
A maximum of 4-5 harvests can be taken in a
year for a perennial crop, which will remain in
the field for 3 years. The crop yields 25-30 t
ha-1 green fodder per year.

STYLO AND FODDER MAIZE
GREEN MANURE CROPS
Sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea)
It is a vigorous growing green manure crop,
which can be incorporated at 10 weeks after
sowing. It does not withstand waterlogging.
The seed rate is 25-35 kg ha-1. The green matter
yield is 15-20 t ha-1. Quantity of nitrogen fixed
by the crop is 75-80 kg ha-1.
Daincha (Sesbania aculeata and S. rostrata)
Sesbania aculeata
It is a quick growing succulent green
manure crop, which can be incorporated at
about 8 to 10 weeks after sowing. This crop
adapts to varying conditions of soil and climate.
It can be grown even under adverse condi-
tions of drought, waterlogging, salinity etc.
Recommended seed rate is 20 to 25 kg per ha.
The green matter yield is 10-20 tonnes per ha.
Quantity of nitrogen fixed is 75 to 80 kg per ha.
Sesbania rostrata
It is a green manure crop, which has
nodules both on the stem and root. It thrives
well under waterlogged condition. The normal
seed rate is 30 to 40 kg per ha. To get early,
uniform germination and vigorous seedlings,
seeds have to be scarified with concentrated
sulphuric acid for 15 minutes and then washed
thoroughly with fresh water and sown immedi-
ately. A green matter yield of 15 to 20 t ha-1
equivalent to 150-180 kg N ha-1 is obtained
within a period of 8 to 10 weeks.
Wild indigo or kolingi
(Tephrosia purpurea)
It is a slow growing green manure crop
suitable for light soils. It resists drought but does
not withstand water stagnation. The seed have
a waxy, impermeable hard seed coat and do
not quickly germinate. To hasten germination,
the seeds are to be abrased with sand or
steeped in hot water at 55ºC for two to three
minutes. The seed rate is 20-25 kg ha-1 and
the green matter yield varies from 8 to 10 t ha-1.
When kolingi is sown in an area for two or
three seasons continuously, scattered seeds will
give rise to volunteer plants and there is no
need for further sowing.
Indigo / Bengal indigo
(Indigofera tinctoria)
Indigo resembles kolingi, but has more leafy
habit. It shows resistance to drought. Better
yield is obtained when two irrigations are given
and when grown in clayey soil. Seed rate is 20
kg ha-1. Green matter production is 8-10 t ha-1.
FODDER SORGHUM (Sorghum sp.)
Fodder sorghum is an ideal tropical
forage crop. It is fairly drought resistant and
suited for areas where moisture is a limiting
factor for crop growth. The crop can be raised
during both monsoons. All soils except sandy
soils are suited for the crop. Apply N, P2O5
and K2O fertilizers @ 60, 40 and 20 kg per
ha, respectively. Important varieties are
M.P.Chari, MPKV-1, JS-20, S-1049 and
JS-3.
FODDERV SORGHUM AND GREEN MANURE CROPS
272
 GREEN LEAF MANURE CROPS
Gliricidia (Gliricidia maculata)
It is a shrub, which takes up a tree habit
under favourable conditions of soil and
climate. For green leaf purposes, the shrub
should be kept low by pruning or lopping at a
height of 2-3 m. The shrub can be pruned two
or three times a year and it withstands repeated
lopping. Within two years after planting, the
plants are ready for lopping. Each plant gives
5 to 10 kg of green leaves annually.
Subabul (Leucaena leucocephala)
This species, a native of Central America,
occurs as a branched shrub. It is a promising
forage tree crop, the leaves of which
contain about 3-4 per cent of N. Leucaena fixes
about 500-600 kg N ha-1 per year.
Cassia (Cassia auriculata)
Propagated by seeds. During flowering tree
is topped (stem and branches cut) and loppings
used for green leaf manuring.
273
GREEN LEAF MANURE CROPS
AILANTHUS OR MATTI (Ailanthus triphysa)
Ailanthus trees flower in February-March
and the fruit, a reddish brown samara,
ripens in March-April, which represents the
ideal time for seed collection.  The seeds can
be stored only for a few months.  Alternate
wetting and drying improves seed
germination. The procedure involves soaking
the entire quantity of seeds in cold (room
temperature) water in the evening and draining
the water next morning, followed by
drying the seeds under shade during the day.
The cycle is repeated for two to three days.
AGROFORESTRY
Agroforestry refers to land management
systems that integrate agricultural crops with
forest crops.  It is a collective term for all land
use systems and practices in which woody
perennials are deliberately grown on the same
land management unit as crops or animals,
either in some form of a spatial arrangement
or in a time sequence and in which there is a
significant interaction between the woody
perennials and the crops or animals.
Types of Agroforestry
The major classes of agroforestry include,
agrisilviculture, silvopastoral, agrosilvopas-
toral and other (miscellaneous) systems.
Agrisilviculture refers to systems in which
agricultural crops are integrated with trees on
the 
same 
land 
management 
unit
either in time or space.  Examples include
taungya, alley cropping, multipurpose trees
either as woodlots or as scattered trees on
farmlands or on farm boundaries, crop
combinations involving woody perennial
plantation crops, growing commercial crops in
association with planted shade trees or trees
in natural forests, shelterbelts, energy planta-
tions, enriched fallow and so on.
Silvopastoralism represents land manage-
ment systems in which forests including
forest plantations are managed for the
concurrent production of wood and livestock.
They also refer to situations in which trees are
scattered in pasture/grasslands, protein banks/
cut and carry fodder production system
involving woody perennials and the like.
Agrosilvopastoral systems, the most
intensive form of land management, are
systems in which the land is managed
concurrently for the production of agricultural
and forest crops and for rearing of domesti-
cated animals.
In addition, there are many agricultural
practices associated with forest that strictly do
not fall under the above categories.  These
include, collection of non-timber forest
products from forests, growing trees around
wetlands and other water bodies in which fish
culture is practised, apiculture with trees and
multipurpose woodlots etc.
Trees in Agroforestry
Many tree species (woody perennials) are
encountered in agroforestry.  These include
common timber species such as ailanthus
(matti), teak, wild jack and multipurpose tree
species  such  as  mango,  jack,  tamarind,
erythrina, gliricidia etc.  Species-specific
recommendations for some important
timber (softwood and hardwood) trees are
given below.

CASUARINA (Casuarina equisetifolia)
Casuarina is a large evergreen tree with a
straight bole and numerous, long, slender,
drooping, jointed, leafless branchlets arising
from rough woody branches.  The jointed
branchlets, which are partly deciduous, are
green and perform the functions of leaves.
Leaves are minute scale like and arranged in
the form of a cup at the joints of the branchlets.
Bark is brown, rough, fibrous and exfoli-
ating in longitudinal strips.  Wood is very
Nursery practices
Raised beds of 10 m x 1 m are formed.
Preferably sand, soil and FYM (1:1:1 ratio)
must form the top layer of the beds.  Sowing is
done after the bed is watered. Usually
sowing is done by broadcast method (or
dibbling) in Nov-December, for June
planting and March-April, for October-
November planting.  After sowing, a thin layer
of soil is sprinkled on the beds to cover the
seeds.  The beds are also mulched with green
leaves to reduce the evaporation losses and
dusted with carbaryl 10 per cent to prevent
insect attack.  Seed rate is 1 kg per bed.  After
sowing, watering is done with a fine rose-can
twice a day for 10-15 days and once a day
afterwards.  The nursery beds also must be
weeded as and when necessary.
Pricking out
Germination takes place in about 8-10 days
after planting and the seedlings attain a height
of 10-15 cm in six weeks time.  They are then
pricked out into polythene bags containing
1:1:1 mixture of sand, soil and FYM.
Planting practices
Containerised stock (commonly in polybags,
but also in root trainers) is planted in pits (15-
20 cm cube) at 2 m x 2 m spacing with the
onset of rains, in the case of monospecific
woodlots. To suit the requirements of
intercropping, the row-to-row spacing can be
altered. Ailanthus is ideal for planting in the
homestead or farm boundries either in single
or staggered paired rows at a spacing of
2.5 m x 2.5 m.
Two to three weedings may be necessary
in the initial years to keep the plantation
weed - free.  Fertilizers may be applied @
30-40 g N, 15-20 g P2O5 and 15-20 g K2O per
year per sapling from the second year to the
fifth year and thereafter once in three years
for a pure plantation.
In case too many lateral branches are
produced, pruning may be practised. The trees
can be felled/harvested over a period of 8 to
10 years.
Pests
Nursery:  The two major pests are shoot
webber (Alteva fabriciella) and defoliator
(Eligma narcissus).  Shoot webber is
economically more important because it will
damage the terminal shoot and can result in
epicormic branch formation. It can be
controlled by application of quinalphos at
0.05 per cent.
Young plantations:  The above two are the
major pests in young plantations also, but
control measures may not be cost effective.
If required, 0.1 per cent quinalphos can be
applied using rocker sprayer. Shoot webber
affects seed production. Usually control
measures are not adopted but any insecticide,
which is recommended under the nursery, can
be used.
275
AILANTHUS OR MATTI  AND CASUARINA
hard, but liable to crack and split.  It is used as
timber, poles, pulp and paper besides fuel-
wood.  Casuarina is grown as an ornamental
tree throughout the tropical and subtropical
parts of India.  In addition, it can be grown in
agroforestry combinations involving diverse
crops.  Fodder grasses, other agronomic crops
such as pulses, oil seeds and vegetables,
coconut palms and tree crops such as teak and
ailanthus are important in this respect.
Propagation
Propagation is by seeds or through
vegetative means. For seedling production,
about half kg seeds are sown on raised nursery
beds of 10 m x 1 m.  This will produce about
10,000 good quality seedlings.  If the soil is
sandy, mix farmyard manure with the
topsoil.  After sowing the seeds, a thin layer of
sand is sprinkled to cover the seeds.
Usually sowing is done in Nov-December.
Regular watering and shading of the
nursery beds are necessary to facilitate rapid
seed germination. Germination takes about 10
days and seedlings attain a height of
10-15 cm in 6 weeks.  They are then pricked
out into polythene bags or transplanted into
beds of size 1 m x 10 m in January-February.
Vegetative propagation is by branch
cuttings, stump cuttings and layering.  For
vegetative propagation by rooting of branch
cuttings, treat 5-7 cm long cladode cuttings with
rooting hormones. The hormone- treated
cladodes are transferred to presoaked
vermiculite and kept in a mist chamber.  About
hundred per cent rooting is obtained within 15
days.  The rooted cuttings are then
transferred to a mixture of sand, soil and farm
yard manure (2:1:1) for hardening. After
15 days, the hardened propagules can be
transferred to the field.
Planting and stand management
Casuarina has a wide environmental
adaptability and hence occupies sites
ranging from arid regions to coastal zones.
Being an actinorhizal plant, casuarina is
capable of biological nitrogen fixation.
Therefore, it thrives best on sandy soils low in
nitrogen and has the potential to improve the
nitrogen capital of impoverished sites.
Site preparation includes ploughing the land
2-3 times and making 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm
pits before the onset of monsoon.  The pits are
filled with FYM and topsoil.  Planting is done
immediately after the first rain.  Block planting,
row planting and line or strip planting are
common.  Spacing varies depending on the
objective and the end product.  Usually a
spacing of 75 cm x 75 cm is adopted.   One or
two weeding is done immediately after the
rains. When the trees are about 3 m in height,
the lateral branches are pruned to a height of
about 2 m.  Pruning is usually done at the end
of the second year or after the beginning of
the third year.  In plantations established at close
spacing (75 cm x 75 cm), one thinning in the
second year or third year depending on tree
growth is desirable, where 25-50 per cent of
the trees are felled.  In mixed species systems
such as agroforestry, spacing and thinning
practices are mainly dependent on the cropping
systems and the nature of the associated
species.  If the associated crops are shade
intolerant generally wider spacing and or
intensive thinning are recommended.
Fertilizers may be applied at the rate of
20-25 g N, 15-20 g P2O5 and 15-20 g K2O per
seedling per year from the second year to the
fifth year.
Injuries and protection
Damping off, seedling blight, stem
canker and seedling rot are encountered
in the nurseries. Stem wilt or bark
blister disease caused by Trichosporium
vesiculosum is a serious disease in the
plantations. The disease affects trees of 3-4
years and causes mortality up to 80 per cent.

EUCALYPTUS (Eucalyptus spp.)
Eucalyptus is an Australian genus
comprising of 140 species. They are evergreen
species, all more or less aromatic and
containing oil glands in their leaves. Mysore
gum (Eucalyptus tereticornis), flooded
gum (Eucalyptus grandis), blue gum
(Eucalyptus globulus) and lemon-scented
gum (Eucalyptus citriodora) are the important
eucalyptus species grown in Kerala. Of these,
Mysore gum and flooded gum are important
timber species in the low- and mid-altitudinal
zones of the state, respectively. The cultivation
practices of these two species are described
below.
E. grandis grows best in deep, permanently
moist, well-drained soils. E. tereticornis also
prefers moist and well-drained soils such as
loamy sands or alluvial loams, with high nutrient
availability.  A certain degree of salinity is
tolerated, but strongly acid soils are ill suited.
E. tereticornis adapts to a variety of sites, but
responds poorly to excessively long dry periods.
It is very easy to regenerate both species and
they are good coppicers.  The number of seeds
per kilogram for E. grandis is 2.5 million,
whereby roughly 630 viable seeds can be
expected per gram. In the case of
E. tereticornis one gram contains
approximately 540 seeds.
Planting stock
Three-month-old containerized stock
(polybag seedlings or root trainer seedlings) is
recommended for planting.  For seedling
production, sow the seeds in seed tray in
February.  Trays should be kept moist with a
fine spray of water until germination begins.
Germination begins 7-9 days after sowing.  The
seedlings should be pricked out when they have
two pairs of leaves into polybags of size
22 cm x 10 cm or root trainers.  Planting stock
of high yielding disease resistant clones are
available at the KFRI / Kerala Forest
Department nurseries.
Planting and stand management
Best time for planting is the beginning of
rains. Planting is usually done in 20 cm x
20 cm x 20 cm pits (for clones use 30 cm cube
pits) at 3 m x 3 m spacing.  For production of
pulpwood and fuel-wood, 6 -10 year rotations are
used without thinning.  Depending on site
conditions, E. grandis and E. tereticornis may
respond to mineral fertilization with
accelerated growth. Fertilizers may be
Maintaining a soil pH of 6.5 to 6.8 and treating
the plantation with fungicidal sprays can control
this disease.  Other diseases include stem
canker and dieback caused by Phomopsis
casuarinae, pink disease caused by Corticium
salmonicolor, root rot disease caused by
Ganoderma lucidum and heart rot caused by
Polyporus glomeratus, Fomes fastuosus and
F. senex.  Stem canker and dieback can
be controlled by spraying carbendazim @
0.05per cent.
Insect pest problems to the tune of regular
epidemic infestations inflicting extensive
economic losses rarely occur in casuarina.
Harvest
Casuarina seedlings growing rapidly at the
rate of about 1.2 to 1.5 m per annum
during the initial seven to eight years are
usually harvested in about 7-10 years.  Yield
of high density fuel-wood plantations varies
from 10-20 tonnes per ha per year on 7-10
years rotations.  Higher yields are reported
from irrigated and fertilized sites.
277
CASUARINA AND EUCALYPTUS
MANGIUM (Acacia mangium)
Mangium is a major fast-growing tree
species in forestry plantation programmes in
Asia and the Pacific.  It tolerates varied site
conditions and has adaptability to different
planting objectives. Mangium shows most
vigorous growth on well-drained, fertile soils
in high rainfall areas (>2000 mm annually) in
the humid tropics.
Propagation
Flowering in mangium is precocious.  It
starts to flower and produces seeds 18-20
months after planting.  Pods can be collected
from the trees in January-February under
Kerala conditions, when the pods turn very
dark-green to light-brown in colour.  Seeds are
extracted manually after sun-drying.  Pods and
seeds should not be left to dry in the sun for
long.  Store the seeds under dry and
insect/rodent-free conditions.  The number of
seeds in one kg of pure seed varies among
trees (mean: 125,000 seeds per kg).
applied at the rate of 30 g N, 30 g P2O5 and
15g K2O per sapling per year during the
second, third and fourth years.
Injuries and protection
Polyphagous insects seem to attack the
nursery stock. Quinalphos or malathion 0.05
per cent is recommended against them.
Drenching the containers with chlorpyrifos is
a preventive measure against termite attack in
plantations. Quinalphos 0.05 per cent
solution is recommended to control stem borer
attack.
Cylindrocladium leaf blight and pink
diseases are common in eucalyptus trees. To
control Cylindrocladium leaf blight, spray
carbendazim 1 g l-1.  Bordeaux paste is
recommended against pink disease. Use
disease tolerant clones for, preventing the
incidence of both diseases.
Uses
E. grandis wood is pink to pale reddish
brown in colour. It has good bending properties.
It is used for housing construction, floors,
furniture, crates, and veneers, in the paper
industry and as fuel-wood. E. tereticornis
produces dark red wood.  It is hard, strong,
tough, heavy, very durable and resistant to
termite attack.  It is used for a wide range of
construction applications, suited for trench
linings and fuel-wood. E. globulus and E.
citriodora leaves are used for commercial
production of Eucalyptus oil.
Pre-sowing treatment and nursery
practices
To break dormancy of mangium seeds, hot
water treatment is recommended.  The seeds
are tied in porous cloth and immersed in near
boiling water (90°C)
 removed from the heat
source for not more than 30 seconds. Pour off
the water. Add cold water (room temperature)
20 times of the seed volume. Let stand
overnight to imbibe and sow the seeds in the
nursery beds/seed trays. Seed inoculation with
appropriate rhizobial strain is recommended
before sowing. Mangium seedlings are ready
for pricking out in 6-10 days after sowing.
Polythene bags are the most common
containers used in the tropics for pricking out.
Mangium seedlings attain a target size of
25-40 cm height in about 12 weeks.  Seedlings
are hardened by progressively reducing
watering and removing shade in the nursery.
If the seedlings have grown larger than the
target size in the nursery, they may be lopped.
EUCALYPTUS AND MANGIUM
278
Planting and stand management
Planting is usually done in pits of 20 cm
depth and 10-12 cm diameter.  In monospecific
stands, spacing of 2 m x 2 m or 2.5  m x 2.5 m
is common. However, if saw - log production
(large diameter stems) is the objective, wider
spacing (3-3.5 m between rows and between
plants) should be followed. In agroforestry
situations, spacing within rows and between
rows must consider the effect of shade and
root competition on the yield of associated
crops. Shade tolerant crops such as turmeric
and ginger can be intercropped with Mangium
trees planted at 2 m x 4 m or 4 m x 4 m spacing.
The crops can be raised in one meter wide
beds laid in between the planting rows of
Mangium.
First weeding must be carried out two
months after planting and thereafter at
regular intervals depending on weed growth.
On favourable sites, mangium plants emerge
and dominate the weeds within two years, thus
not requiring any further weed control.
Fertilizers may be applied @ 30-40 g N,
15-20 g P2O5 and K2O per seedling per year
from the second year to the fifth year.
Mangium needs regular pruning and thinning
if the plantation objective is to produce
quality saw logs on 15 to 20 year rotation. These
operations in general are not required for pulp
wood production on  6 to 8 years rotation.
However, multi-stemed seedlings may be
‘singled’.  In pruning, branches are carefully
removed in one or more steps along the bottom
trunk up to about 6-7 m height.  For saw log
production regimes is given as Table 33.
Silvicultural schedule is recommended. The
average wood yield per tree on a 15 years
rotation is about 0.7 to 1.0 m
3.
Injuries and protection
Although root rot disease caused by
Ganoderma sp. (red rot), Phellinus sp.
(brown rot) and Rigidoporus lignosus are
major problems in mangium stands, there are
no specific control recommendations against
these fungi.  Signs of the disease are evident
on the roots after the tree has fallen or upon
excavation. Depending on, which fungus
causes the disease, there may be dark
reddish granular rusty brown encrustation or
white thread-like rhizomorphs on the surface
of the rots.  The usual method of controlling
root rot caused by fungi that spread by root
contact is to remove and destroy all diseased
roots and woody debris.

MANGIUM
TEAK (Tectona grandis)
Teak is the paragon among Indian
timbers.  It is a large tree that attains a height
more than 30 m.  Teakwood is extensively
used in construction, for making door/
window shutters and frames, furniture,
cabinets, railway coaches and wagons, and
ship/boat building. It is an ideal wood for
parquet and decorative flooring and excellent
wood for wall panelling. The species is
indigenous to India and the Southeast Asian
region.  In India teak is distributed naturally in
the peninsular region.  It prefers a warm moist
tropical climate with mean annual precipitation
of 1100-2000 mm and a well-drained fertile soil.
Being a strong light demander it does not
tolerate overcrowding and does not withstand
waterlogging.
Propagation
Seeds (fallen fruits) should be collected from
vigorously growing middle-aged trees
characterized by straight boles, desirable
branching habit, good form and less fluting.
Freshly fallen intact fruits with inflated
calyx from such trees can be collected
during December-February. The ground
must be cleared before hand by removing
litter and other materials to facilitate seed
collection.
endemic areas, can be achieved by using
copper fungicides. The best way to prevent
pink disease, however, is to plant tolerant
varieties.
Progressive decay of the heartwood (heart
rot) is another malady afflicting mangium trees.
Normally, fungi that decay heartwood do not
attack sapwood; such trees continue to grow
to maturity and may outwardly appear healthy
and vigorous.  However, since heart rot is
progressive, there will be considerable decay
cull at the end of the rotation.  A variety of
basidiomycete fungi have been associated with
this malady. At present there are no control
measures against mangium heart rot.  The best
way is to avoid injury to trees and wound
dressing.
Although about 30 insect species are
reported to be pests of mangium, only a few
such as root feeders, branch and stem
borers and the red coffee borer are considered
economically important. Root feeders
(Sternocera aequisignata) can be controlled by
chlorpyrifos application to the soil or
seedbeds.  To prevent branch and twig borer
(Sinoxylon anale) occurrence, remove and
burn all broken branches in which breeding
takes place.  The only effective method to

Utilization of mangium wood
Timber is used for a variety of purposes
like wood-based panels, pulp and paper
industry etc.  Mangium wood gives attractive
furniture, cabinets, moulds and door/
window components.  However, the presence
of flutes and incidence of rots and termite attack
will detract both the quality and
quantity of sawn timber from mangium logs.
Therefore, mangium has greater potential as a
component of composite wood products such
as veneer and plywood, laminated
veneer lumber, fibre boards etc. and for
chemical uses such as pulp, paper and
tannin production, besides fuel-wood.
MANGIUM AND TEAK

After cleaning and drying the seeds may be
safely stored in gunny bags or sealed
containers.  Seeds of diameter greater than
9 mm are usually collected.  For convenience
in storage and transport, the bladder like
calyx of the fruit is removed.  This is done by
half-filling a bag with the fruits and
vigorously rubbing and shaking it or by
beating with sticks, after which the remains of
the calyces are separated from the nuts by
winnowing. Due to hard seed coat,
germination of one-year old seeds is better than
that of fresh seeds.
Pre-sowing seed treatment
1. Teak seeds kept in jute sacks should be
soaked in water during night time and dried
in sun during day time. This practice is to
be continued for one week.
2. Termite feeding:  Spread the teak fruits on
the ground in a 5 cm layer immediately
after collection.  After about five weeks
the termites remove the exocarp
and subsequent germination after
alternate wetting and drying is found to be
better.
Nursery practices
Raised beds (30 cm high, supported with
split areca stems) of 10 m x 1 m are formed.
Sand and soil mixed with FYM form the top
layer. Sowing is done after the bed is
watered. Usually the sowing is done by
broadcast method or dibbling in April-May.
Seed rate is 3-5 kg of seeds per bed.  After
sowing, the seeds may be pressed into the
beds.   A thin layer of soil also can be sprinkled
to cover the seeds.  The beds are also mulched
with green leaves to reduce evaporation losses.
The bed is then dusted with carbaryl 10 per
cent to prevent insect attack.Traditional
mulching materials may be substituted with a
single layer of newspaper.
One-year-old seedlings of 1-2 cm (thumb
thickness) at the thickest portion below the collar
are uprooted from mother beds and used for
making stumps.  Stumps with 15-20 cm of root
at 2-3 cm of stem prepared with sharp knife
are commonly used for planting.  Teak
seedlings can be produced in shorter duration
by using polythene bags or root trainers.  Three
to four month old teak seedlings are pricked
out from the germination beds into polythene
bags (30 cm x 20 cm) in the month of March/
April.  Three- month-old root trainer seedlings
are also popular, of late.
Planting
With the pre-monsoon showers, stump
planting is done in crowbar holes during April-
May (four to six weeks before the onset of
regular monsoons).  The site must be cleared
of stubble or other competing vegetation, if any.
If containerized planting stock (polybags, root
trainer) is used, then optimal time of
planting may be after the onset of southwest
monsoon in June-July.  They are usually planted
in pits of size 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm.  Spacing
recommended for monospecific woodlot is
2 m x 2 m.  However, if intercrops are proposed
to be raised, then row-to-row distance can be
altered.  For one or two row strip plantings at
farm boundaries, a closer plant-to-plant spacing
of 1 m could be employed initially and later
thinned to attain better size.
Weeding and fertilization
Six or seven weeding may be necessary
during the first two years.  Teak is very
susceptible to weed competition. Fertilizers
may be applied @ 30-40 g N, 15-20 g P2O5
and 15-20 g K2O per plant per year from the
second year to the fifth year and thereafter
once in three to four years for 10-12 years.  In
agroforestry situations, if the intercrops are

THORNY BAMBOO (Bambusa arundinacea)
Bamboos are woody perennial grasses that
occur in the tropical and subtropical
evergreen and deciduous forest formations of
Asia-Pacific. Important uses of bamboo include
paper and pulp industry, fuel, food, feed, house
construction and scaffolding, making
several articles of everyday use, besides
controlling soil erosion.  One hundred and
thirty wild and cultivated bamboo species are
reported to occur in India. They exist under
diverse ecological conditions, often as an
under-storey in many forest types. In
agroforestry, thorny bamboo is perhaps the
most important species in Kerala.
fertilized, the quantities of chemical
fertilizers applied to teak can be proportionately
reduced or even skipped.  Providing life-saving
irrigation during the summer season favours
teak growth.
Thinning
For a fifty-year rotation, monospecific teak
plantation on a good site (initial spacing
2 m x 2 m), thinning may be carried out at
4, 8, 12, 18, 26 and 36 years after planting.
Thinning in short rotation (25-30 years) high
input plantations can be at 4, 8, 12 and
16 years.  The thumb rule governing
thinning is that trees should not be allowed to
compete with each other for site resources, as
intense competition may depress teak growth.
Therefore, considering the site characteristics,
tree growth rate and merchantability of the
thinned out materials, a flexible thinning
schedule can be adopted.  A teak density
management diagram can be used for this
purpose.  In general thinning is delayed on poor
sites.
Mixed plantations
Fruit/spice/medicinal trees also can be
successfully intercropped with teak throughout
its growth.  Additionally, inclusion of
nitrogen fixing trees such as Gliricidia or
Leucaena (subabul) either in alternate rows
or every third row not only improves teak
growth but also saves chemical nitrogenous
fertilizers.  However, manage (by lopping or
pruning) the nitrogen fixing tree component in
such a way that it does not compete with teak
for light.
Pests, diseases and their control
White grubs feed on roots in the nursery.
Vascular wilt disease (Burkholderia
solanacearum) is noticed in nursery and young
plantations. As preventive measures against
this disease, maintain proper drainage and avoid
root injury.  Leaf spot disease (Phomopsis sp.
and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides) in
nursery and young  plantations can be controlled
by carbendazim 0.05 per cent application.
Against pink disease (Corticium salmonicolor)
in young plants, apply Bordeaux paste.
Defoliators (Hyblaea purea) and
skeletonisers (Eutectona machaeralis) can be
controlled by quinalphos 25 EC 0.05 per cent
spray.  However, only in small plantations /
woodlots chemical control through
insecticide spray is advocated.  For controlling
stem borer (Sahyadrassus malabaricus) apply
0.2 per cent quinalphos at the site of infection
after removing the frass.  Avoid injury to root
and collar to prevent bud rot and heart rot
occurrence. Cut and remove the parasitic
plants 
(Dendrophthoe 
falcata 
var.
pubescens) before fruiting.
TEAK AND THORNY BAMBOO

Propagation
Bamboos are propagated either by seeds
or vegetative means (offsets, division, culm/
rhizome cuttings or layering).  In general,
bamboos are monocarpic, i.e. they flower only
once and die after producing seeds.  Most of
the economically important bamboos flower
gregariously at long intervals of 30-40 years.
Although large quantities of seeds are
produced during gregarious flowering, they are
viable only for about six to eight months.  Seeds
can be germinated in nursery beds and pricked
out into polybags of size 18 cm (flat width) x
22 cm.  One year-old seedling can be used for
planting. However, when seeds are not
available, bamboos are propagated
vegetatively.
Propagation by offsets is the common
method of vegetative propagation.  One-year-
old culms in a clump are given a slanting cut at
about 90 to 120 cm above the ground. The
rhizomes to which they are attached are dug
out with the roots intact.  The shoot portion is
then cut off to a length sufficient to
include a well-developed bud.  These offsets
are planted out sufficiently deep in the soil to
cover the first two or three nodes. Planting
should be carried out immediately before the
rainy season.  During extraction care must be
taken to avoid damage to roots and
rhizomes of mother clumps.
Work at the KFRI has shown that using
rooted culm cuttings is a viable alternative to
the laborious offset method.  For vegetative
propagation using culm cuttings, extract 2 to 3
year old culms from healthy clumps by
cuttings just above the first node during March-
April.  Trim the leaves and side branches
without injuring the auxillary buds.  Prepare
two-node cuttings (leaving about 5-7 cm on
either side of the nodes) using a sharp knife or
saw.  Make a small slit (about 2 m long and
1 cm wide) or drill holes (about 7 mm diameter)
in the middle of the inter node.  Wrapping in
moist gunny bag or embedding in boxes
containing moist saw dust might minimize
exposure of the cuttings.  Pour about 200 ml
of NAA (1-naphthalene acetic acid) solution
(100 ppm) carefully into the culm cavity through
the slit and close the slit/hole by wrapping with
a polythene strip.  Ensure that the polythene
wrapping is tight so that the solution does not
leak out.  After extraction, the culm cuttings
should be treated with NAA as quickly as
possible.
Prepare raised nursery beds of 10 m x 1 m
and fill with a mixture of soil and sand (3:1).
One week prior to planting, drench the
nursery bed with  30 litres of carbendazim 0.05
per cent to prevent fungal attack.  Place the
cutting horizontally  (the opening facing
upwards) across the nursery bed.  About 50-60
cuttings may be conveniently planted in a raised
nursery bed.  Cover the cuttings with a thin
layer of soil.  Provide shade and water the
beds regularly till the onset of monsoon
but avoid waterlogging. Rooted cuttings can
be transplanted to the field in about four
months. Cuttings sprouted and rooted at both
the nodes of a culm cutting must be separated
carefully through the middle to get two plants.
Propagation by division is usually done in
the case of dwarf bamboos, which are easy to
handle.  It involves splitting / dividing the mass
of rhizomes and planting out the culms in
small clumps with two or three culms
attached.  Other methods of vegetative
propagation include rhizome cuttings and air
layers.  Sections of fresh living rhizome of the
preceeding year about 15 to 30 cm long
containing at least one bud and air layers form
successful means of propagating some bamboo
species.

THORNY BAMBOO
ROSEWOOD (Dalbergia latifolia)
Rose wood is an important timber yielding
tree  of South India. It is the costliest timber  in
the world trade. It varies in size according to
locality and attains its maximum growth  in the
southern region  of Western Ghats. It reaches
to a maximum height of  40 m and a girth of 6.0
m. Uncontrolled felling caused the widespread
removal of rose wood from  our forests.
bamboo plantations is 10 m x 10 m. Propagules
can be planted in pits of size 45 cm x 45 cm x
45 cm.  Fertilizers may be applied @ 40 g N,
10 g P2O5 and 75 g K2O per plant per year in
1-2 year old plantations.
Competitive interactions in bamboo-
based agroforestry
Being perennial grasses, bamboos have
higher root length densities than dicots.  Thus
in mixed species system, bamboos may out-
compete the field crops or other tree crops
grown in association.  However, interspecific
competition in bamboo-based agroforestry
systems can be overcome by planting crop
8-9 m away from the bamboo clumps.
Trenching (30-40 cm wide and 50-60 cm deep
at 5-6 m away from the clumps) to spatially
isolate bamboo roots from the rest of the crops
is recommended, if crops are to be planted at
shorter distances. Bamboo root competiti-
veness is usually a function of its rooting
intensity with crown radius.  Larger clumps
have wider foraging zones usually extending
to about 8 to 9 m. Therefore canopy reduction
treatments such as pruning and culm thinning
are appropriate to surmount interspecific
competition. Pruning up to a height of 1.5 above
the ground is recom-mended in plantations of
four year and above.  Also remove the dry
and dead culms from the centre of the clump to
reduce congestion.
Pests and diseases
The bamboo plantations in Kerala do not
face any serious insect problems. Young plants,
however, are likely to be affected by shoot
borers and sap suckers. In bamboo nurseries,
damping off caused by Rhizoctonia solani is
a major disease. It can be controlled by
prophylactic fungicidal treatment and by
regulation of shade and watering. In young
plantations, rhizome bud rot (Pythium sp.,
Fusarium sp.), rhizome decay (Pseudomonas
sp.) and basal culm decay (Fusarium sp.) are
important.
Extraction of bamboo culms
Either all the old culms, i.e. those more than
three years old (six years in the case of clumps
regenerated from seedling) or a certain number
of mature culms are removed annually.  Older
culms in the interior of the clumps should be
removed in a horseshoe pattern. The height of
cuttings is usually at 30-50 cm above ground.
It is necessary that cuttings should leave at
least one node above the ground to prevent
rainwater soaking into the rhizome.
WILD JACK OR AINI (Artocarpus hirsutus)
Ideally suited for boundary planting and as
scattered trees on the farm field.
Performance 
under 
monocultural
situations is not promising.  Seeds or wildings
(scattered seedlings found profusely on
the farm fields) can be collected during
the monsoon season and planted at
the desired spots in the field.  On farm
boundaries, closer plant-to-plant spacing
(1 m) can be adopted.
THORNY BAMBOO, WILD JACK OR AINI AND ROSEWOOD
284
Wayanad district of Kerala is famous  for
the abundance of rose wood trees.
Artificial Propagation
Propagation is possible both by direct
sowing and by planting seedlings, root
suckers and sections of lateral roots. Stump
planting of nursery seedlings is favoured,
particularly in the west coast. Mature
pods are  collected from the trees during
November-December.  For direct sowing it is
advisable to break the pods into one seeded
parts.  It can  be stored up to 6 months after
sun drying.  Seed weight is 18000 seeds/kg.
Soaking in cold water for 24 hours before
sowing will result in 80 per cent germination.
Instead of direct sowing, nursery raised
seedling or stumps are also used to raise
plantations. Seeds are sown in raised nursery
beds during rainy season. Seeds start
germinating within one week. The beds are
regularly watered and weeded. One year old
seedlings are  used to prepare stumps. Stumps
are prepared by pruning shoots having a
diameter of more than 3 cm and roots at a
length of  30 cm. Seedlings of 30 cm tall, 3 cm
collar diameter, 30-40 leaves, 10-15 cm root
length are normally transplanted. Through tissue
culture, good planting materials can be
produced which was proved by the research
work carried at the Kerala Agricultural
University, College of Forestry. During
initial years, the seedlings should be protected
from weeds, cattle and fire.
Natural regeneration
Under natural conditions, regeneration by
seeds and  root suckers takes place.  Wind
dispersed seeds will  germinate in the early
part of the rainy season. The conditions
favourable for seed germination and seedling
growth are moderate shade, loose and fairly
moist soil. For the further development of
saplings overhead light is necessary. The
seedlings should be protected from fire, weeds
and cattle. The tree produces a large number
of root suckers from its long, horizontal,
superficial root branches. Root suckers can also
be used for propagation. Wounding of roots by
digging around trees stimulates root sucker
production.
Planting and stand management
Saplings of rosewood can be planted in pits
of 30 cm cube made at a spacing of 5 x 5 m.
Pits are taken before the onset of monsoon
and filled with 5 Kg of FYM and top soil. Initial
growth of tree is found to be relatively low.
Even though habitat is deciduous, it is evergreen
in  the moist zone of its distribution. In dry areas
it shed leaves during February-March and then
flushes soon. White flowers will be produced
during January-February. Fruit will start
developing during March and takes 7-8 months
to mature. It is drought resistant. It stands a
fair amount of shade, especially when young,
but benefits greatly by overhead light. In too
open situations, it tends to become crooked and
branchy. Though it can withstand fire, fire
protection measures are beneficial for the
economic development of Indian rose wood
forests.  The growth of the tree is very slow. It
thrives best on well drained, deep, moist soil,
particularly in the  neighbourhood of perennial
streams. Weeding particularly during the early
stages are recommended. Depending up on the
age and size, about 50-70g of N, 30-50 g P2O5
and 30-50g K2O along with 30 Kg of FYM per
plant is applied from second year onwards
during monsoon.

ROSEWOOD
SANDAL (Santalum album)
Sandal is  a beautiful sacred tree and has
been widely described in the ancient Hindu
scriptures and epics.  The tree is a native of
India.  This crooked thin branched evergreen
tree is one of the costliest timbers.  The world
famous sandal wood oil is extracted from its
heartwood.  Full grown trees will attain about
12-13 m height and 1-2 m diameter. It is found
in most parts of India. Sandal, which is
distributed from sea level up to about 1800 m
height, is found to grow in a variety of soils.
Sandal which grow on sandy soil are more
fragrant. Places where average annual
rainfall  is about 700-1600 mm is best suited
for its growth.
Artificial propagation
Usually nursery raised seedlings are
transferred to field.  Pods are collected
during the month of April, May, September and
October. Collected pods are soaked in
water and dried well after removing fleshy
portion.1 kg pod contains 6000 seeds.
Dipping seeds in Gibberellic  acid  50 ppm will
be effective for  germination. Cold water
dipping for 24 hrs will result in 30-40 per cent
germination. Soil beds of size 10 x 1m are used
for sowing. Before this, soil has to be
thoroughly mixed with Ekalux.  2 ½ kg seeds
can be sown in  each bed.  Beds have to be
covered with hay.  Healthy seedlings are to be
transferred in polythene bags. If seedlings are
to be retained in the polythene bags
beyond one year, host plants are necessary.
Host plant will help it in its early stages of
growth.  Branches of the host have to be  cut
down (removed) frequently.
Natural regeneration
Natural  regeneration  is  by bird  dispersed
seeds. Seedlings are naturally seen in shrubby
diseases. Damping off disease by
Phytophthora is also common particularly in
nursery which can be controlled by drenching
Bordeaux mixture 1 per cent. Pests of Coccidae
and Membracidae family also attack these
plants. Shoot webber Atteva sp. and defoliator
Eligma is seen in some places which can be
controlled by Quinalphos 0.05 per cent.
Timber
The sapwood is narrow and pale yellowish
white in colour, often with a purple tinge. The
heart wood ranges in colour from golden
brown  through shades of light rose, purple with
darker streaks  to deep purple with rather
distinct black lines, darkening with age. It is
fragrant, heavy, narrowly interlocked grained
and medium coarse textured. The timber is
stronger and much harder than teak and has a
slightly higher elastic limit than Burma teak.
Harvesting is done after 60-70 years. One cubic
meter  wood  weighs  about  880 kg.
Uses
Indian rosewood ranks among the finest
woods for furniture and cabinet work.  It is
also a valuable decorative wood suitable for
carving and ornamental ply boards and
veneers. It is used for making windows, doors,
agricultural implements etc. It is grown in
coffee plantations as a shade tree.  The bark
of the tree contains tannin.  Parts of the tree
are reported to be useful as stimulant and
appetiser and also used for the treatment of
dyspepsia, diarrhoea, leprosy, obesity etc.
Leaves are used as fodder.  It increases the
soil nitrogen content. So it is use in agro forestry
and social forestry programmes.

areas / places well surrounded by thick
vegetation. This is meant for protection against
sun rays, animals, drought etc. Natural
propagation becomes easier if soil is wet and
a host plant like Lantana is available near.
Planting and management
After a period of 8-10 months, seedlings of
size of 20 cm tall, 5cm girth with 20-25 leaves
with brownish stem and small branches are
transferred  to field.  Three methods are used
for field preparation. In one method, seeds are
allowed to germinate by placing in small pits.
This method is practiced usually in shrubby
areas, where sprouting seedlings are well
protected during rainy season.
In the second method, seeds are placed in
large pits / soil mound along with host plants.
In the third method, seeds are allowed to
geminate within polythene bags and transferred
to field in 50 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm pits with a
spacing of 3 m between plants filled with 5kg
FYM. Host plant is also planted along with
each sandal seedling.  This is the best method.
Suitable host plants are Pongamia pinnata and
Casuarina equisetifolia.
Sandal is a semi root parasite.  It means
that during the early stages of its development,
it absorbs food from another plant
(host plant).  Flowering begins after 2-3 years
of vegetative growth.  It happens twice in a
year from March to May and September to
December. As these two flowering  seasons
coincide, both buds as well as mature pods are
found on the same plant.  Simultaneously, shade
bearing capacity changes gradually and the
tree later becomes a light dependent one.  Small
root suckers  are seen arising from the cut
portions.  Sunlight will produce small cracks
on the outer  skin surface of the  plant especially
in the case of young trees. In extreme
conditions, the wood may get exposed and the
plant will undergo total damage.  In order to
give protection from this, the surrounding
vegetation has to be retained. Fertilization is
done with 30-50 g N, 25-50g P2O5 and 30-50g
K2O in addition to 40 g FYM per plant per
year depending upon the size and age of plant.
Plant  protection
Sandal spike disease is a serious
problem. This is believed to be caused by
mycoplasma like organisms.In affected plants,
growth of leaves gets stunted (assumes a spike
like form and hence the name “spike disease”)
and later premature leaf fall occurs. Within
2-3 years, plant will die.  A preventive measure
is yet to be known.  However, removal of
affected plant parts or plants as a whole from
the field is recommended against spike disease.
Spike disease is transferred by pests like
Jassidus indicus, Moono albimaculata etc.
These vectors can be controlled by quinalphos
0.05 per cent. Sandal is also affected by stem
borers such as Zeuzera coffeae, Aristobia
octo-fasiculata etc. which can be controlled
by spraying dimethoate 0.05 per cent.
Timber
Sapwood is whitish or yellowish white with
no smell.  Heartwood changes in colour from
yellowish brown to reddish brown and has a
good smell.  Heartwood is produced only after
20 years of growth.Usually trees are uprooted
instead of cutting from the ground level as oil
content  in roots is greater.  One cubic meter
wood  weighs about 897-1137 kg. The “Kerala
Preservation of  Trees Act 1986”  has put
restriction on cutting this tree.  Permit is needed
for its collection, retention or sale. One can
keep up to 3 kg of sandal for domestic purposes
without licence.  A sanctioned certificate of
ownership from Tahsildar  is to  be submitted
before Divisional Forest Officer by people who

SANDAL
In Kerala, Kampakam is also known as
Thampakam, Irippu, Irumpakam etc.  This
round headed huge tree is found in the wet
evergreen forests of Western Ghats.  Full
grown tree usually attains 30-37 m height and
4-4.5 m breadth at the end of 40 years. Mostly
distributed in areas which are located in
between sea level and 1100 m above it.   Heavy
rainfall and properly drained and aerated soil
are necessary for its growth.  Seen abundantly
along river banks and hill slopes with fertile soil.
Artificial propagation
Artificial propagation is by seeds.Seeds can
be stored in sacks up to 20 days. 1 kg will
contain about 2500 seeds.  Both direct sowing
or by transferring nursery raised seedlings to
fields are practiced. It is good to sow seeds
soon after collection as they are recalcitrant.
In the case of direct sowing, shady and weed
free localities are preferable.  Shade trees
should be removed after 4-5 years of growth.
Usually a distance of 3m x 3 m or 4 m x 4m
are used. If nursery raised seedlings are used
for planting,  shady areas have to be preferred.
After sowing, soil covering of  thickness  not
more than 4 mm  is given. If there is no rainfall,
regular watering is essential.Germination takes
place within 2-3 weeks.
Natural regeneration
Seen in forests by germination of wind
dispersed seeds during rainy season. Only in
sunny regions, seedlings are found to  grow
well.
Planting and management
Seedlings of 14 to 16 months  old plants are
to be transferred to fields. Planting is done in
pits of 45 cm cube with the onset of monsoon
at a spacing of 4m x 4m filled with 5 kg FYM.
Weeding and thinning are necessary for
seedling growth. From second year onwards
depending on size of plant, 50-70g N, 40-50g
P2O5, 40-60g K2O along with 30 kg FYM are
applied to each plant. If the area is fertile,
within 40 years,  timber of  above  20 m height
and 150 cm diameter will be obtained.
Even though  Kampakam is an ever green
tree, it will drop mature leaves during the months
of December and April. They will produce pale
yellowish flowers during January to February.
Seeds attain maturity during the months of
May-June. They can overcome drought as they
are deep rooted.  They prefer wet areas.
Although they are shade tolerant during their
early stages of growth later it becomes a light
demander. Dense vegetation will destroy its
seedlings. It is sensitive to fire and frost.
Plant  protection
Usually the tree is affected by fungi like
Fomes lamaocnis, Tramelies spongi pellis
etc. which will cause rotting. Leaf spot by
Botryodiplodia theobrommae is serious in
have sandal tree at home. About 75 per cent
of the selling price of a sandal tree goes to its
owner. On the basis of quality, grade 1 kg
sandal costs about Rs. 250-500/-.
Uses
Dark red coloured oil from seeds is used in
making varnishes. It is also found to be
effective in skin diseases. Sandal wood oil from
heartwood and roots is useful for the synthesis
of powder, soap,  perfumes and other cosmetic
items.  Sandal wood and  oil are medicinal and
also has religious importance. Sandal wood is
used in making small boxes, stationery items,
jewellery  boxes etc.

IRUL (Xylia xylocarpa)
Locally this is also known as Irumullu,
Kadamaram, Iruppool, Panka, Pankali etc.
These large sized trees are commonly seen in
the deciduous forests. Mostly found in places
located about 600 m above sea level. In the
forest areas of malabar, a large number of
trees having 30 m height and 2.5 m diameter
can be seen.  Profusely branched stem is its
characteristic feature. Reddish ash bark is
very rough and  cracky. In dry areas stunted
growth is reported. Grows well in places
where annual rainfall is above 1000 mm and
atmosphere is hot as well as humid. River
banks and places with red soil are best suited
for its growth. Lateritic soil is also found
to be good for this species. Poor growth in
clay soil.
Artificial propagation
This is effected by direct sowing or by
planting stumps and seedlings from nursery or
seedlings from forest. Sun dried seeds are
used for sowing in the field. This method is
found to be the most efficient one. Soaking the
seeds in cold water overnight enhances
germination. Seeds are sown on loose soil.
Avoid  clay soil. Weeding is necessary during
seedling stage. Soaking the seeds in growth
hormones like IAA 250 ppm or GA 50 ppm
for 30 minutes will enhance germination to
70 per cent.
Natural regeneration
Large number of seedlings are naturally
found growing in forests. They are fire and
drought resistant.
Planting and management
Planting in the field is done at a spacing of
4m x 4m. Standard pits are filled with rich top
soil and FYM 5 kg. In addition to FYM, from
second or third year onwards, 50-70g N,
50-60 g P2O5 and 50-70g K2O is also added to
each plant depending on size. Growth  is
fast during favourable season. It attains a
diameter increment of about 6 cm/year. Felling
can be done after a period of 30-50
years growth.
At the end of the winter season, leaf fall
will start. Soon after new sprouts and
flowers will be produced. Light  yellow flowers
possess a good smell. Pods are of length
10-15 cm and diameter 4-5 cm and these
brownish red pods have the shape of shoes.
8-10 seeds are present in one pod. 1 kg  pod
contains more than 3000 seeds. During the early
stages of growth, shady regions are preferred.
Later they become light demanding. Root
suckers are abundantly produced in certain
regions.  It is a very good coppicer also.
some parts. Plants are also affected by stem
borers like Xyleborus, Mussicus etc. which
can be controlled by quinalphos 0.05 per cent.
Timber
Timber is having more strength, weight and
hardness than teak. One cubic meter timber
weights about 945 kg. It is not easy to differen-
tiate heartwood and sapwood. Reddish brown
timber possess white patches here and there.
Uses
As bark contains tannin, it is used in
tanning industry. Termite and pest infections
are rare, so it used in manufacture of furniture,
railway sleeper, buildings etc.

KAMPAKAM AND IRUL
MAHAGONY (Switenia macrophylla)
It is an evergreen tree attaining a height of
about 30-40 m and a diameter of about
3-4 m within a span of 30-35 years.  This is an
exotic species with bark peeling feature.
Abundant growth occurs in places with
average annual rainfall of 1500-5000 mm and
in fertile laterite soil.
Artificial propagation
Easiest method of propagation is by
using seeds.Seeds are obtained  by drying the
collected pods.  Viability lasts for only up to
7 months.  Seeds are placed in small pits at a
distance of 7.0 cm x 7.5 cm or 10 x 10 cm.
Germination starts within 2 weeks.
Seedlings of height of 30cm, 2cm diameter with
about 20 leaves  are transferred to pits in the
field.  Direct sowing is found to be successful.
Seedlings can also be transplanted in polythene
bags. Polybaged seedlings having a height of
30cm with 20 leaves are found to be better
Plant  protection
In fire damaged areas, xylia trees  are
found to be infected by fungi like  Fomes,
Polystictus etc. Stem borers and defoliators
also cause severe damage. Growing of trees
in healthy environmental conditions, preventing
fire, grazing etc. is found to be more effective
than using pesticides, fungicides etc.
Timber
Reddish brown heartwood posses white
lines.  Sapwood is pale coloured.  Has more
strength  and hardness than teak. One cubic
meter timber weights about 832-944 kg.  Wood
is termite resistant. Sawn wood can be stored
for about 10-15 years without any preservative
treatment.
Uses
Due to the presence of resin in the wood,
they can resist the attack of fungi, termites etc.
Hopea timber was used in the manufacture
of railway sleepers. It is also used in making
pillars of huge building, bridges etc. It can resist
damage by water. Pulp is used in paper
industry. During the ancient period, the timber
was used for making coal in iron furnace.
Bark is having medicinal value. Powdered
bark mixed with honey is a good medicine for
diarrhoea, vomiting, gonorrhoea etc. Skin
contains tannin also. Pod is edible. Leaves can
be used as a bio fertilizer.  Suitable for rearing
Lac insect.
planting materials in the main field.
Natural regeneration
By the  germination of fallen seeds.
Removal of shade is essential for its
germination.
Planting and management
Poly bagged seedlings are the best planting
materials in the main field. Planting is done
in pits of 35 cm cube filled with top soil and
10 kg of FYM. Pits are taken with the onset
of monsoon and planting is done during
June-July. Unlike other species slightly wider
spacing of 3m x 3m is given in the main field.
Though the trees are evergreen in nature, leaf
fall occurs during the months of February,
March.  Red coloured young leaves appear to
develop at about the beginning of
April-May months. Pod maturation occurs in
a year. The tree is somewhat shade tolerant.
Extreme shade is detrimental. Frost

THEMBAVU (Terminalia tomentosa)
This tree is known as “Crocodile barked
tree” as the thick, dark coloured, spitted bark
looks like the skin of a crocodile.  Very
suitable for afforestation purposes in open
places with clayey soil.  It grows to about
36 m height and attains a diameter of about
4 m if the climate is favourable. It grows
well in places located at about 800 m above
sea level.
Artificial propagation
By direct sowing or by planting nursery
raised seedlings. In the case of direct
sowing, seeds are sown in lines keeping a
distance of 12 cm between. Soaking the seeds
in cold water for 24 h will result better
germination. Weeding is necessary.  Thinning
is also essential for their healthy growth.
Planting and management
Planting is done in pits of 30 cm cube
along with onset of monsoon at  a distance of
5m x 5m. Plants are generally sensitive
and watering and weeding are important
during the initial years of establishment
of plantation. Leaf fall occurs during
January-February. Young leaves appear  during
March and April.  Bunches of white flowers
are produced during the months of May-June.
Pods get matured within 5-6 months.  Root
system  grows deeply in the soil. Small suckers
are seen sprouting out from the exposed roots.
Best coppicer also. Though the tree can grow
in almost all  types of soils, laterite soil with
proper drainage is best suited.  It is drought
sensitive and frost resistant.
Plant  protection
Wood rot is caused by Dacdalea flavida,
Fomes melanoporus, Ganoderma lucidum
etc. Metanestria hyrtaca, Denia litura etc.
cause premature leaf fall. Fungal diseases can
be controlled by spraying carbendazim
0.05 per cent.
Timber
Heartwood is dark ash coloured
with black spots and lines.  Sap wood is
reddish white.  Though this is not good as that
of teak, industrially it is very important.   One
cubic meter wood weights about 375-761 kg.
sensitive.  Can be cultivated as a mixed crop
in teak plantations. Fertilization at the rate of
30-50 g N, 40-50 g P2O5, 50-70g K2O along
with 20-30 kg FYM per plant depending on
size is good from second year onwards.
Plant protection
Fungi like Botryodiplodia theobromae and
Coletotrichum gloeosporioides produce leaf
spot disease. This can be controlled by spraying
carbendazim 0.05 per cent .The stem borer,
Hypsophylla robusta is also found to infect
the tree.  Cultivating mahagony in blocks, along
with cashew tree will prevent the attack of
stem borers.
Timber
One cubic meter of  timber with annual rings
weighs about 560 kg and is of light
reddish in colour.  The wood is durable,
attractive and has high demand in the
market.
Uses

MAHAGONY AND THEMBAVU
Venga  is one of the largest trees of
deciduous forests. Highly branched (spreading)
crown is its characteristic feature. Reddish
gum is seen flowing through the timber. It
attains a height of about 30 m and diameter of
about 2 ½ m. Grown in steep hill slopes and
plain areas. In Kerala, it is found in regions
located about 1070 m above sea level. Even
though they grow in almost all types of soil,
good drainage is essential. Regions having
rainfall 75-200 cm is best suited.This light
dependent tree becomes frost  sensitive during
the later stages of growth.
Artificial propagation
Artificial propagation is by seeds. Seeds are
collected from full grown trees and  soaked in
cold water for about 2-3 days before sowing.
Germination stars with in 10-15 days.Seedlings
of 10cm height are transplanted in polythene
bags filled with potting mixture. Bagged
seedlings are kept under partial shade in
nursery. One kg of seed lot contains about 1000
seeds.
Natural regeneration
Natural propagation is by seeds.  In the
seedling stage, shade is necessary. Protecting
trees from animals and fire and also ploughing
the soil enhances natural propagation.
Planting and management
Site preparation includes ploughing the land
and making 30 cm cube pits before the onset
of monsoon. Pits are filled with red soil and
5 kg FYM. Planting is done at a spacing of 4m
x 4m along with south west monsoon. Fertilizer
mixture of 60-70 g N, 50-60 g  P2O5, 50-70 g
K2O along with 25-30 kg FYM per plant is
recommended from 2nd or 3rd year onwards.
In the seedling stage shading is necessary.
Lateral branches are pruned from third year
onwards.
Plant  protection
The fungi, Polyporus gilvus,Ganoderma
lucidum, Fomes fastuvosue etc. are commonly
found to infect this tree. Common fungicides
can be used to prevent their attack.
Timber
Sapwood is pale white. Yellowish brown
heartwood possess dark lines. 1 m3 timber
weighs about 800 kg. The timber is highly
durable upto or more than 20-22 years.
Drying of timber in sun light,  after  soaking  in
water for about 6 weeks is effective in
improving durability and also useful for
removing stains.
Uses
This tree is best suited for agroforestry and
social forestry.  Used as a shade tree in the
tea and coffee plantations of South India.
Gum-keno obtained from Pterocarpus is used
for dyeing, printing, tanning etc. Leaves are
used as cattle feed and green manure.  Flowers
and bark have medicinal properties also.
Timber is used for the manufacture of posts,
buildings, beams, furniture, boat, agricultural
instruments etc.
VENGA (Pterocarpus  marsupium)
Uses
Wood is used for making building, furniture,
railway sleepers etc. Tassar silkworm moths
eats its leaves. Bark contains tannin, hence
used in tanning industry. Gum from the
tree has medicinal value. Juice from bark
is a good colouring agent for cotton and
silk cloths.
THEMBAVU AND VENGA
292
Chadachi, also known as Uthi, has
the timber  looks like that of teak and  is
most commonly found in the moist deciduous
forests of Kerala.  Usually they attain a
height of 12 m and 1.5 m diameter.  But
remarkable growth is seen in trees growing
along the Western ghats which possess a height
of 24 m and a diameter of 2 m. This grows
well on soil which is best suited for teak
plantations.  Even though best growth occurs
in full sun light, they are shade tolerant. It is
also frost sensitive. Root suckers are produced
abundantly. This species is also a good
coppicer.  Leaf fall occurs during the month of
March and new leaves are produced during
the month of April.  Flower production is in
February and seeds begin to mature during
May.
Artificial propagation
Seeds can be collected during the months
of June-August and can be stored up to
4 months.  Artificial propagation is possible by
direct sowing or by planting stumps or nursery
raised seedlings in the field. Warm water
treatment of seeds are found to be good for
better germination.
Planting and management
Planting and management practices are
similar to that of venga.
Plant  protection
In the case of old trees, wood rot is caused
by the fungus Ganoderma sp.  Therefore, aged
trees have to be cut and removed as early as
possible. Grown up trees are also affected by
stem borers and defoliators, which can be
controlled by spraying quinalphos 0.05 per cent.
Timber
Heart wood is reddish brown with black
patches. Brown colour of sapwood deepens
with age. More strong and elastic than Teak.
One cubic meter timber has about 785 kg
weight.  Easy for felling and sawing.
Uses
Timber is used for making furniture,
vehicle parts, windows, doors etc. Skin
and timber have some medicinal property.  Coir
is made from skin fibres.  Seeds are edible.
Leaves are good cattle feed. Mucilaginous
extract from leaves is good for hair health.
CHADACHI (Grewia tilifolia)
PUNNA (Calophyllum ionophyllum)
This is a medium sized  evergreen tree  best
suited for protecting sea shores. Ash coloured
or dark green leaves are its characteristic
features.  Grown well in sandy and alluvial soils.
Mostly distributed along sea shores and also in
the tropical evergreen forests. Cultivated as
shade giving plants along road sides and also
as ornamental one.
Artificial propagation
Artificial propagation is by direct sowing
or by planting nursery raised seedlings.  Pods
are collected during the month of  March.  One
kilogram contains about 250 seeds.  Hard coat
is to be removed. Soaking the seeds in cold
water for 12 hours or warm water for
40 minutes is recommended for enhancing

Rotting is caused by fungi belonging to the
genus Fomes.  Young plants are also infected by
fungi like Trichosoma which can be
controlled by spraying 1 per cent Bordeaux mix-
ture.
Timber
Sapwood has pale reddish white colour.
Heartwood  is reddish brown with mottled dark
lines.  Felling and sawing are very easy.  It
can be kept in water for a long period of time
without any damage.  One cubic meter
  timber
weighs about 655 kg.
Uses
Wood is used for making posts, beams,
furniture etc.  Used  in plywood industry  also.
Dark green coloured oil from seeds is a good
fuel and used for making soap, varnishes etc.
Oil cake is a fertilizer.  Saponin in the leaves is
detritus to fishes.
AGROFORESTRY SYSTEM
Agrisilvicultural systems
Shade loving crops such as ginger
perform better in the inter-spaces of tree
species such as ailanthus (at four years of age,
planted at a spacing of 2 m x 2 m; with
60 per cent of the light in the open).
Multipurpose tree species like ailanthus,
teak, vellapine, silver oak and green manure
yielding trees can be successfully interplanted
in the older coconut plantation (preferably
above 30 years of age), often in association
with other field crops including medicinal plants
such as kacholam.  Depending on the space
available (between coconut palms), one or two
rows of multi-purpose trees can be accommo-
dated in the middle (spacing 1-2 m between
plants). Tree management such as lopping/
pollarding etc. is important to prevent any
possible inter-specific competition between the
multipurpose tree component and the coconut
palms.
germination. Soaking in dilute sulphuric acid
for 20 minutes is also found to enhance germi-
nation.
Planting and management
Planting is done mainly during the
monsoon season. Pit planting is recommended
at a spacing of 3m x 3m. It prefers a sandy
loam soil. Watering is essential in summer
months particularly during initial stages of
development. It can be raised both as pure
crop and also interplanted with banana or
pepper.  Two to three weeding are necessary
during the initial stages of development.
Fertilizers at the rate of 25-30 g N.,15-20 g
P2O5 and 20-25 g K2O can be applied
depending up on size and age. There is
regional variations in flowering seasons.  In
Kerala, flowers are produced during the months
of  March-April.  Pods get matured at the time
of May-June.  This is a light demanding tree.
Fire and wind will cause severe damage.

AGRO-ECOLOGICAL ZONES OF KERALA
Agricultural productivity and agro-
biodiversity of an area are largely governed
by the overhead climate and qualities of land
and soil. In the tropics and subtropics, where
sunlight and temperatures are not limiting, it is
often the precipitation and the capacity of the
land and soil to retain water that control
biological productivity. An agro-ecological
delineation is characterised by distinct
ecological responses to the macro-elements,
which are reflected in the vegetation, soils and
agricultural land use.
The concept of agro-ecological delineations
was developed by FAO (1976, 1978) with
strong emphasis on comparable agro-climatic
parameters to delineate agriculturally potential
areas suitable for particular crops or
combination of crops so that optimum
production potential is achieved. The
significance of homogeneous agricultural
environment, as realised in the agro-ecological
unit is of particular importance in effective and
sustainable land use to enhance agricultural
output for meeting the increasing demand for
food, fodder, fibre and other products. With
the growing demand for food, fodder and fibre,
there is overuse of land or faulty planning of
land use that has resulted in soil health hazards
such as soil degradation and deterioration of
land quality.
The Planning Commission, consequent to
a mid-term appraisal of the planning targets
of the VII Plan (1985-1990), divided the
country into 15 broad agro-climatic zones
based on physiography and climate. In the
scheme the entire Kerala State formed part
of zone 12, West Coast Plains and Ghat region.
The process emphasized development of
resources and their optimum utilization in a
sustainable manner within the framework of
resource constraints and potentials of each
region. This implied a departure from the
previous practice of planning with focus on
specific crops and fertilizers, treating the state
as a unit of planning. The State Agricultural
Universities were advised to divide each zone/
state into subzones, under the National
Agricultural Research Project (NARP).
Accordingly a map of 127 subzones was
prepared, based primarily on rainfall, existing
cropping patterns and administrative units. For
Kerala State 8 subzones were delineated.
1)
Northern zone
2)
Southern zone
3)
Central zone
4)
High altitude zone
5)
Onattukara zone
6)
Kuttanad and Kole zone
7)
Pokkali zone, and
8)
Low rainfall zone
Kerala Agricultural University revised the
NARP delineation of agro-ecological subzones
to generate an Agro-ecological Zones Map of
the state (Kerala Agricultural University,
2007). The basis of spatial delineations was
variability in altitude, rainfall pattern, soil type
and topography. The revision resulted in
delineation of 13 agro-ecological zones for the
state.
The National Bureau of Soil Survey and
Land Use Planning (NBSS & LUP) generated
a map of Agro-ecological Regions of the
country (Sehgal et al., 1992) by integrating
climate, physiography, length of growing period
and soils, an improvement on the agro-climatic
zone map of the Planning Commission which
considered only physiography and climate for
delineation of zones. The agro-ecological
regions (AER) map of NBSS & LUP had 20
regions and the entire state of Kerala formed
part of region 19: Western Ghats and Coastal
Plains, hot humid-perhumid eco-region, with
295
AGRO-ECOLOGICAL ZONES OF KERALA
red, laterite and alluvium-derived soils and
growing period of 210+ days. The Bureau also
generated an agro-ecological subregion map
by subdividing the 20 AER’s into 60 subregions
(Velayutham et al., 1999). Two subregions
found a place in the scheme for Kerala,
Subregion 19.2, Central and South Sahyadri:
hot, moist subhumid to humid agro-ecological
subregion and Subregion 19.3, Coastal Plain:
hot humid to per-humid agro-ecological
subregion.
It was felt by researchers and planners of
the state that the delineations by Planning
Commission, NBSS & LUP and KAU fell
short of fully characterising the agro-ecological
variability in the state. In order to address the
problem and to generate an agro-ecological
units map of the state, the Kerala State
Planning Board commissioned a project to
National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use
Planning in 2008. The analysis of agro-ecology
of Kerala State based primarily on climate,
geomorphology, land use and soil variability
resulted in delineation of five agro-ecological
zones and twenty three agro-ecological units.
AGRO-ECOLOGICAL ZONES
Agro-ecological zones are broad spatial
divisions with emphasis on physiographic
features. The state has been divided into five
agro-ecological zones (AEZ’s). Figure 1
present the spatial distribution of the
agro-ecological zones in the state.
1. Coastal Plain
The Coastal Plain agro-ecological zone
comprises the nearly level to gently sloping
lands along the coast at elevation below 30
metres and lying between the sea and the
midlands. It includes sandy beaches, sandy
plains, coastal laterites and low lying areas such
as estuaries, backwaters, submerged lands,
swamps, marshes, kayal lands and broad
valleys. The zone covers 5,09,246 ha (13.10
%) in the state.
2. Midland Laterites
Midland Laterites agro-ecological zone
comprises undulating to rolling lands
interspersed with narrow valleys between the
coastal plain on the west and foothills and hills
on the east, extending from the southern end
to the northern end of the state. The elevation
ranges from 30 to 300 metres. The zone covers
10,56,385 ha (27.18 %) in the state.
3. Foothills
The undulating to rolling lands and low hills
between the midland laterite on the west and
high hills on the eastern side constitute the
Foothills agro-ecological zone. The terrain has
only very narrow valleys. The elevation ranges
from 300 to 600 metres. The zone covers
4,60,074 ha (11.84 %) in the state.
4. High Hills
The hilly region comprising Western Ghats
and plateaus extending from south to north
constitute the High Hills agro-ecological unit.
The Western Ghats and highland plateaus rise
600 metres above mean sea level, with a
number of peaks well over 1800 metres. The
Western Ghats comprise Central Sahyadri, the
Nilgiris and South Sahyadri. The mountains are
essentially plateau remnants of two or three
altitudinal zones. Slopes of hill ranges can be
as high as 80 per cent. The zone covers
15,53,225 ha (39.97 %) in the state.
5. Palakkad Plain
The Palakkad Gap, resembling an inland
plain with low elevation, is a prominent physical
feature along the valley of the Bharathapuzha
river. The gently sloping lands of Palakkad,
east of Kuthiran hills, flanked on the south and
north by Nelliyampathy hills and Attappady
hills, respectively and merging to Tamil Nadu
uplands through the gap in Western Ghats
constitute the agro-ecological zone, covering
1,60,006 ha (4.12 %) in the state.

AGRO-ECOLOGICAL UNITS
Twenty three agro-ecological units
(AEU’s) have been delineated for the state
based on climatic variability, landform and soils.
Of them, five are identified for the special soil
and hydrological conditions in the coastal zone
requiring unique management strategies. The
spatial bounding limits (external) of the agro-
ecological units have been made to correspond
to the administrative boundaries of panchayats.
That is to say that any agro-ecological unit is
a collection of panchayats. This has been done
to facilitate planning of development activities
on an administrative basis. Figure 2 present
the spatial distribution of the agro-ecological
units and Table 1 provides the area covered
by the units.
AEU 1: Southern Coastal Plain
The Southern Coastal Plain agro-ecological
unit is delineated to represent the nearly level
coastal lands where sands are the dominant
soil type. The unit comprises 42 panchayats
along the coast from Thiruvananthapuram to
Ernakulam district. The climate is tropical
humid monsoon type (mean annual temperature
27.6°C; rainfall 2360 mm).
Probability of annual moderate drought is
one year in a block of ten years. Probability of
moderate drought during NE monsoon period
is twice in ten years. Probability of two
consecutive weeks receiving more than
20 mm rainfall is high from mid-April to 1st
week of December. Soil moisture is generally
adequate for crops from mid-April to 3rd week
of December. Length of growing period for
annual crops is 33 weeks and dry period
(duration of soil moisture deficit) 19 weeks.
Coconut plantations on uplands and rice in
lowlands are the major land use. The unit
covers 56,782 ha (1.46%) in the state.
AEU 2: Northern Coastal Plain
The Northern Coastal Plain agro-ecological
unit represents the coastal plain north of
Ernakulam district and comprises 77
panchayats along the coast from Thrissur till
the northern end of the state. The unit with
tropical humid monsoon climate (rainfall 3133
mm; mean annual temperature 28°C) has
dominantly sandy soils on nearly level lands.
Probability of annual, moderate drought is
once in ten years. Probability of moderate
drought during NE monsoon period is twice in
ten years. Probability of two consecutive
weeks receiving more than 20 mm rain fall is
generally high from 2nd week of May to 1st
week of November in a year. Soil moisture is
usually adequate for crops from 2nd week of
May to end of November. Length of growing
period for annual crops is 30 weeks and dry
period (duration of soil moisture deficit), around
five months. Coconut plantations on uplands
and rice in lowlands are the major land use.
The unit covers 1,22,970 ha (3.16 %) in the
state.
AEU 3: Onattukara Sandy Plain
The special agro-ecological unit Onattukara
Sandy Plain is delineated for the sandy plains
extending into the midlands from coast and
covering 43 panchayats in Kollam and
Alappuzha districts. Climate is tropical humid
monsoon type (mean annual temperature
27.6°C; rainfall 2492 mm) and soils are sandy.
Probability of annual moderate drought is
negligible. However, probability of moderate
drought during NE monsoon period is twice in
ten years. Probability of two consecutive
weeks receiving more than 20 mm rainfall is
high from April to November. Soil moisture is
adequate for crops from 2nd week of April to
2nd week of December. Length of growing
period of annual crops is 37 weeks and dry
AGRO-ECOLOGICAL ZONES OF KERALA
298

299
AGRO-ECOLOGICAL ZONES OF KERALA
period (duration of soil moisture deficit), around
four months. Coconut plantations on uplands
and rice in lowlands are the major land use.
The unit covers 67,447 ha (1.74 %) in the state.
AEU 4: Kuttanad
Kuttanad is a special agro-ecological unit
delineated to represent the waterlogged lands
spread over 69 panchayats of Alappuzha,
Kottayam and Pathanamthitta districts. Large
parts of these lands are below, at or just above
sea level. Climate is tropical humid monsoon
type (mean annual temperature 27.6°C; rainfall
2,746.1 mm).
Probability of annual moderate drought is
negligible. However, probability of moderate
drought during NE monsoon period is probable
in one year for a block of ten years. Probability
of two consecutive weeks receiving more than
20 mm rainfall is high from mid-April to end
of November. In the limited areas of upland
soil, moisture availability is adequate from mid-
April to 3rd week of December. In the uplands
length of growing period for annual crop is 34
weeks and length of dry period (duration of
soil moisture deficit) is around four months.
Hydromorphic soils, often underlain by
potential acid-sulphate sediments and unique
hydrological conditions characterize the unit.
Seawater ingress into Kuttanad is controlled
through bunds and barrages to facilitate rice
cultivation. Lowlands which dominate the unit,
are under water the year round. Rice
cultivation is made possible by dewatering
(pumping out water from fields). Coconut is
grown on the uplands and bunds of the unit
and rice in lowlands. The unit covers 1,26,931
ha (3.27%) in the state.
AEU 5: Pokkali Lands
Pokkali Lands, another special agro-
ecological unit, is delineated for the lowlands,
often below sea level, in coastal areas of
Ernakulam district and extending to parts of
Thrissur and Alappuzha districts. The unit
covers 34 panchayats. Climate is tropical
humid monsoon type (mean annual temperature
27.6°C; rainfall 3,049 mm).
Probability of annual drought is negligible
but the probability of moderate drought during
NE monsoon period is twice in ten years. The
probability of two consecutive weeks receiving
more than 20 mm rainfall is high from 3rd week
of April to 3rd week of November. Soil moisture
is adequate for crops on uplands from mid-
April to mid-December. Length of growing
period for annual crops is 34 weeks while the
length of dry period (duration of soil moisture
deficit) is around four months.
Hydrology and soils are similar to those in
Kuttanad. However, seawater inundation is not
controlled and hence soils are acid-saline.
Coconut is raised on uplands and a special kind
of rice cultivation, locally known as Pokkali
cultivation, is done in lowlands. The unit
covers 39,765 ha (1.02%) in the state.
AEU 6: Kole Lands
The Kole Lands agro-ecological unit, spread
over the coastal part of Thrissur district and
extending to southern coastal parts of
Malappuram district covers 40 panchayats.
Climate is tropical humid monsoon type (mean
annual temperature 27.6°C; rainfall 2,902 mm).
Probability of annual, moderate drought is
once in ten years. The probability of moderate
drought during NE monsoon period is twice in
a block of ten years. A severe drought during
NE monsoon period may occur once in a block
of ten years. Probability of two consecutive
weeks receiving more than 20 mm rainfall is
high from 2nd week of May to 1st week of
November. In the upland, soil moisture is
AGRO-ECOLOGICAL ZONES OF KERALA
300
adequate for crops from 2nd week of May to
end of November. The length of growing period
for annual crops is 30 weeks while the length
of dry period (duration of soil moisture deficit)
is almost five months.
These lands too are, for most part, below
sea level. Seawater ingress into these lands is
controlled through barrages and weirs to
facilitate rice cultivation. The soils are
hydromorphic acid clays, often underlain by
potential acid-sulphate sediments. Coconut is
grown on the uplands of the unit and bunds
and rice in lowlands. The unit covers 71,142
ha (1.83 %) in the state.
AEU 7: Kaipad Lands
The Kaipad Lands agro-ecological unit
occurs along the coast of Kozhikkode, Kannur
and Kasaragod districts as isolated stretches
of waterlogged lands. The unit covers only
16 panchayats. Climate is tropical humid
monsoon type (mean annual temperature
27.3°C; rainfall 3,254 mm).
Probability of annual drought is negligible.
However, the probability of moderate drought
during NE monsoon period is three years in a
block of ten years. Probability of two
consecutive weeks receiving more than
20 mm rain fall is high from mid May to 2nd
week of November. In uplands soil moisture
is adequate for crops from mid-May to last
week of November. The length of growing
period for annual crops is 27 weeks and length
of dry period (duration of soil moisture deficit)
is around five months.
The lowlands, often below sea level, do not
have any protection against sea water
inundation. The hydromorphic, acid-saline, clay
soils are often underlain by potential acid-
sulphate soils. Coconut is grown on the uplands
of the unit and bunds and rice in lowlands. The
unit covers 24,209 ha (0.62 %) in the state.
AEU 8: Southern Laterites
The Southern Laterites agro-ecological unit
spread over 24 panchayats in south-western
part of Thiruvananthapuram district is
delineated to represent the uniqueness of
climate and soils. The area with tropical moist
subhumid monsoon climate receives low
rainfall compared to the other areas of midland
laterites (mean annual temperature 27.1°C;
rainfall 1,884 mm). However, the well-
distributed rainfall from both SW and NE
monsoon restricts the dry period to just three
months in a year.
Probability of moderate annual drought is
once in ten years and of drought during NE
monsoon period twice in ten years. Probability
of two consecutive weeks receiving more than
20 mm rainfall is high from 3rd week of April
to 3rd week of December. Soil moisture is
generally adequate for crop production from
mid-April to mid-January of the following year.
The length of growing period for annual crop
is almost 38 weeks and the dry period
(duration of soil moisture deficit) is only for
3 months.
The soils, though acid and having low-
activity lateritic clay, unlike in other parts of
laterite terrain, are practically free of gravel
and plinthite. Coconut on uplands intercropped
to a variety of annual and other perennial
crops and rice, tapioca, banana and vegetables
on lowlands are the major land uses. The unit
covers 38,727 ha (1.02%) in the state.
AEU 9: South Central Laterites

COMPOSTING
VERMICOMPOST AND COIRPITH COMPOST
Composting is a biological process in which
microorganisms decompose organic matter and
lower the carbon-nitrogen ratio of the substrate.
It is generally prepared from organic waste
material such as crop residue, household waste
etc.
Methods of composting
The available residues in the farm are
collected and stored till they form sufficient
mass for compost making. A trench of suitable
size, say, 4-6 m long, 2-3 m broad and 1–1.5 m
deep is dug, the accumulated residues is well
mixed and spread in a layer of  30 cm in
thickness, along the length of the trench. This
layer is well moistened by sprinkling cowdung
slurry and water over it. A second layer of
identical thickness of the mixed residues is then
spread over the first layer. The process is
repeated till the heap rises to a height of
45 cm to 60 cm above ground level. The top is
then covered with a thin layer of soil. After
three months of decomposition, the mass is
taken out of the trench and formed into a
conical heap above the ground, moistened with
water if necessary and covered with soil. After
one or two months, the manure will be ready
for application in the field.
Vermicompost
Vermitechnology is a process by which all
types of biodegradable wastes such as farm
wastes, kitchen wastes, market wastes,
biowastes of agro-based industries, livestock
wastes etc. are converted to nutrient rich
vermicompost by using earthworms as
biological agents. Vermicompost contains
major and minor nutrients in plant available
forms as well as enzymes, vitamins and plant
growth hormones.
Species suitable: Eudrillus eugineae has
been identified as the most ideal species of
earthworm for vermitechnology under Kerala
conditions.
Vermicomposting of farm wastes
Pits of size 2.5 m length, 1 m breadth and
0.3 m depth are taken in thatched sheds with
sides left open. The bottom and sides of the
pit are made hard by compacting with a
wooden mallet. At the bottom of the pit, a layer
of coconut husk is spread with the concave
side up to ensure drainage of excess water
and also for proper aeration. The husk is
moistened and above this, biowaste mixed with
cowdung in the ratio of 8:1 is spread up to a
height of 30 cm above the ground level and
water is sprinkled daily. After the partial
decomposition of wastes for 7 to 10 days, the
worms are introduced @ 500 to 1000 numbers
per pit. The pit is covered with coconut fronts.
Moisture is maintained at 40 to 50 per cent.
After around 60 to 75 days, when the compost
is ready, it is removed from the pit along with
the worms and heaped in shade. The worms
will move to bottom of the heap. After one or
two days the compost from the top of the heap
is removed. The undecomposed residues and
worms are returned to the pit for further
composting as described above. The
vermicompost produced has an  average
nutrient status of 1.5 per cent N, 0.4 per cent
P2O5 and 1.8 per cent K2O with pH ranging
from 7.0 to 8.0. The nutrient level will vary
with the type of material used for composting.

VERMICOMPOST AND COIRPITH COMPOST

Precautions
1. The composting area should be provided
with sufficient shade to protect it from
direct sunlight.
2. Adequate moisture level should be
maintained by sprinkling water whenever
necessary.
3. Preventive measures should be adopted to
ward off predatory birds, ants, rats, etc.
Vermicomposting of coconut leaves
Weathered coconut leaves can be
converted into good quality vermicompost in
a period of three months with the help of
earthworm, Eudrillus sp. On an average,
6-8 tonnes of leaves  will yield 4-5 tonnes of
vermicompost with about 1.2, 0.1 and 0.5 per
cent  N, P2O5 and K2O respectively.
Vermicomposting of household wastes
A wooden box of 45 cm x 30 cm x 45 cm
or an earthen/plastic container with broad
base and drainage holes may be selected. A
plastic sheet with small holes may be placed
at the bottom of the box / container. A layer
of soil of 3 cm depth and a layer of coconut
fibre of 5 cm depth may be added above it
for draining of excess moisture. A thin layer
of compost and worms may be added above
it. About 250 worms are sufficient for the box.
Vegetable wastes of each day can be spread
in layer over the coconut husk fibre. Top of
the box may be covered with a piece of sac
to provide dim light inside the box. When the
box is full, it can be kept without disturbance
for a week. When the compost is ready, the
box can be kept outside for 2-3 hours so that
the worms come down to the lower fibre layer.
Compost from the top, may be removed, dried
and sieved. The vermicompost produced has
an average nutrient status of 1.8 per cent  N,
1.9 per cent P2O5 and 1.6 per cent K2O, but
composition will vary with the substrate used.
Mass multiplication of earthworms
Earthworms can be multiplied in 1:1 mixture
of cowdung and decaying leaves in a cement
tank or wooden box or plastic bucket with
proper drainage facilities. The nucleus culture
of earthworms is to be introduced into the above
mixture at the rate of 50 numbers per 10 kg of
organic wastes and properly mulched with dried
grass, straw or wet gunny bag. The unit should
be kept in shade. Sufficient moisture level
should be maintained by occasional sprinkling
of water. Within 1-2 months, the earthworms
multiply 300 times, which can be used for
largescale vermicomposting.
Preparation of vermiwash
Method 1
The system consists of a plastic basin having
a capacity of 20 litres, a plastic perforated
wastepaper basket and a PVC pipe of 5 cm
diameter and 30 cm length.The waste paper
basket is covered with a nylon net and placed
at the centre of the basin upside down. A hole
is made at the bottom of the waste paper basket
so that a PVC pipe of 5 cm diameter can be
placed into the basin through the hole in such a
way that one end of it touches the basin. The
PVC pipe is perforated so that the leachate
from the basin seeps through the wastepaper
basket and collects in the PVC pipe, which
can be siphoned out by a kerosene pump. The
basin outside the wastepaper basket, is lined
with a layer of brick pieces at the bottom and
a 2-3 cm thick layer of coconut fibre of  2-3
cm placed above it. After moistening this,
2 kg worms (about 2000) are introduced into
it and 4 kg kitchen waste is spread over it.
After one week, the kitchen waste turns into
a black well decomposed compost. Two litres
of water is sprinkled over the compost
containing worms. After 24 hours, the leachate
collected in the PVC pipe is removed by
309
VERMICOMPOST AND COIRPITH COMPOST
siphoning. The collected leachate is called
vermiwash, which is actually an extract of
compost containing worms. This is used for
soil application and foliar spray in different
crops. Vermiwash is honey-brown in colour
with a pH of 8.5 and N, P2O5 and K2O content
200, 70 and 1000 ppm respectively. For large
scale collection of vermiwash, a cement tank
of size 80 cm x 80 cm x 80 cm with a side tap
is constructed. A layer of small brick pieces
or gravel is placed at the bottom of the tank.
Above it a layer of fibre of 3-4 cm thickness
in placed. A definite quantity of biowaste
(4 kg) is added to the system along with 2 kg
of earthworms. After two weeks, the entire
mass of biowaste will turn to brownish black
compost. It is sprinkled with  2 litres of water.
Vermiwash is collected through the side tap
after 24 hours. Biowaste can again be added
to the system and the process repeated.
Method 2
This is a simple and economical technique
to collect vermiwash. The system consists of
an earthen pot of 10 kg capacity with a hole at
the bottom, which is filled with pieces of stone
up to a height of 10 cm from the bottom. A
plastic net is spread over this. Then a thick
layer of coir fibre along with humus containing
1500-2000 worms of Eudrillus euginae or
Isenia foetidae is added to the pot. The hole
situated at the bottom of the pot is fixed with a
water tap through which vermiwash is
collected. The kitchen waste of each day is
added to the container.  The composting
process is allowed to continue for a week or
more till brownish black mass of compost is
obtained. Occasionally, two or three
tablespoons of fresh cowdung slurry is poured
on the humus as feed for the worms. After
the formation of compost,  the entire mass is
soaked with two litres of water. After 24 hours,
about 1.5 litre of vermiwash can be collected.
This process can be continued for one or two
weeks till the brown colour of wash
disappears. The less enriched compost that
remains in the pot can be collected and used
as fertilizer. Later, the pot can be emptied and
set up again to continue the process.
The vermi wash, either alone or in
combination with botanical pesticides can
be used for pest management in kitchen
gardens.
Recommendation for crops
When vermicompost is applied as organic
manure instead of FYM, the quantity of
in-organic fertilizers can be reduced to about
half the recommended dose.
Coirpith composting
Coirpith, is produced in large quantities as
waste material of the coir industry.
Every year, approximately 2.5 lakh tonnes of
coirpith accumulate in Kerala as waste.
Coirpith has wide C:N ratio and its lignin rich
nature does not permit natural composting
process as in other agricultural wastes.
Mushrooms belonging to the genus Pleurotus
have the capacity to degrade part of the
cellulose and lignin present in coirpith by
production of enzymes such as, cellulases and
lactases, bringing  down the C:N ratio as well
as lignin content.
Method of composting
Materials required: Coirpith 1 tonne, urea
5 kg, mushroom (Pleurotus) spawn 1.5 kg.
A shaded place of 5 m x 3 m dimension may
be selected and levelled after removing weeds.
100 kg coirpith may be spread uniformly. Spread
300 g (one bottle or cover) of Pleurotus spawn
on this and cover with a second layer of
100 kg coirpith. On the surface of the second
layer, spread 1 kg urea uniformly. Repeat this

BIOFERTILIZERS
The use of biofertilizers is  important while
practising integrated plant nutrient
management as well as organic farming. Some
of the commonly used biofertilizers in Kerala
are as follows.
1. Rhizobium (Bradyrhizobium and
   Azorhizobium)
It induces better root nodulation and stem
nodulation in inoculated plants and thereby
brings down the requirement of nitrogen
fertilizer for the cultivation of pulses, oil seeds
and legume green manures. Commercially it
is available as carrier based inoculum. Method
of application is seed treatment.
2. Azotobacter
Suitable for upland crops like vegetables,
tapioca, plantation and orchard crops. It is
available as carrier-based inoculum. It fixes
about 15–20 kg of N per ha under ideal
upland conditions and thereby reduces the
requirement of nitrogen fertilizers by
10-20 per cent. Methods of application are seed
treatment, seedling dip and direct soil
application.
3. Azospirillum
It is suitable for both upland and wetland
conditions and is available as carrier-based
inoculum. It fixes about 20-25 kg N per ha
under ideal conditions, thereby effecting a
reduction of 25 per cent in the quantity of
N fertilizers required. Treatment with
Azospirillum also induces better root formation
in inoculated plants. Hence this biofertilizer
is also recommended for rootinduction
in polybag raised seedlings of plantation and
orchard crops as well as  vegetables. The
isolates of Azospirillum brasilense strains
AZR 15 and AZR 37 from Kuttanad soils are
highly effective for rice, vegetables and
nursery plants.
Methods of application
Seed treatment: For treating 5-10 kg seeds,
500 g culture is required. Moisten the seeds
by 
sprinkling 
water 
or 
rice-gruel
water. Take 500 g culture in a plastic tray/basin,
add moistened seeds, mix well and dry in shade
for 30 minutes. This may be sown immediately.
Seedling root dip (for transplanted crops):
Slurry of the culture is prepared by mixing 500
g culture with 50 ml of water and the roots are
dipped in the slurry for 15–20 minutes before
transplanting.
Soil application: Mix the culture with FYM
or compost in the ratio 1:25 and apply directly
in the soil.
sandwiching process of one layer of coirpith
with spawn followed by another layer of
coirpith with urea up to 1 m height. Sprinkle water
if necessary to keep the heap moist. Allow
the heap to decompose for one month.
The coirpith is converted into good manure
after 30-40 days and the lignin content is
reduced from 30 per cent to 40 per cent.
Another significant change is the lowering
down of C: N ratio from 112:1 to 24:1.
This coirpith compost contains macro
nutrients as well as micronutrients. It has the
unique property of absorbing and retaining
moisture to about 500-600 per cent. It improves
the water infiltration rate and hydraulic
conductivity of soil.
311
VERMICOMPOST AND COIRPITH COMPOST AND BIOFERTILIZERS
Inoculation for paddy: Mix 2 kg of
culture in 60 litres of water and soak the seeds
required for 1 ha (60 kg) for 24 hours before
sowing. At the time of transplanting, dip the
roots of seedlings for 15-20 minutes in the
culture slurry prepared by mixing 2 kg inoculum
with 40 litres of water. This slurry can be used
for treating seedlings required for
1 ha. Another 2 kg culture may be applied in
the field along with FYM or compost.
4. Blue green algae (BGA)
Mainly recommended for wetland rice
cultivation. It is available as carrier-based
inoculum and it fixes about 25-30 kg N per ha
under ideal conditions. However, the use of
this biofertilizer is not feasible in acidic soils
with pH below 6.0.
Method of application
Broadcasting in the rice fields at the rate
of  10 kg ha-1 one week after transplanting.
5. Azolla
It is suitable for wetland rice cultivation.
The required quantity of azolla will have to be
raised in the farmers field itself. Fixes  about
25 to 30 kg N per ha.
Method of application
Apply fresh azolla at the rate of 10 t ha-1 at
the time of ploughing.
6. Phosphate solubilising bacteria and fungi
Recommended mainly for upland crops
raised in neutral and slightly alkaline soils.
Available as carrier-based inoculum. Enables
the efficient utilization of cheaper sources of
phosphatic fertilizers such as rock phosphate by
the crop plants.
Method of application: Seed treatment and
direct application.
7. Vesicular/Arbuscular mycorrhiza
    (VAM/AMF)
Vesicular arbuscular mycorrhiza (Glomus
spp.) is mostly recommended for upland crops,
especially for raising container and tissue
culture plantlets and transplanted crops. It
mainly improves the uptake of available P by
inoculated plants. There is also an enhanced
absorption of water and other nutrients such
as N and K and certain micronutrients.
Mycorrhiza inoculation can improve the
survival and establishment of tissue culture
plantlets under field conditions as well as induce
better resistance against certain soil borne plant
pathogens. It is commercially available as
granular inoculum consisting of infected roots
and soil with mycorrhizal spores. It is given as
soil application.
VAM is suitable for tropical tuber crops.
The inoculation can be done by placing inoculum
(3-5 g/sett) beneath the sett before planting.
The rate of spore load in the inoculum should
be to the tune of 50 to 400 spores per 100 g
soil medium.
Application techniques of biofertilizers
1. Seed treatment
Five hundred grams of commercially
available inoculum will be required for treatment
of seeds for one hectare area. For this, thick
slurry of the carrier-based inoculum is initially
prepared by mixing 500 g of the inoculum in
1.25 litres of water. The stickiness of the
biofertilizer on seed surface can be significantly
improved by using 10 per cent jagerry solution
or 5 per cent sugar solution supplemented with
40 per cent boiled and cooled gum arabic
solution or rice-gruel water. The required
quantity of seed material is then gently mixed
with this slurry without damaging the seed coat.
The treated seeds are spread evenly over a
gunny bag and dried in shade and sown
BIOFERTILIZERS
312
immediately in moist soil. The treated seeds
should never be exposed to direct sunlight for
a long period of time since the UV rays of
solar radiation will reduce the population of
inoculated bacteria on seed surface
significantly.
2. Seedling treatment
This method is mainly recommended for
transplanted crops. The roots of seedlings to
be transplanted are dipped in water slurry of
the biofertilizer (500 g in 2.5 litres of water)
for 20 minutes, prior to transplanting.
3. Soil application
Soil application is generally recommended
for all types of biofertilizers except Rhizobium,
Bradyrhizobium and Azorhizobium. The
method is to apply the biofertilizer after mixing
with dried FYM, compost or vermicompost at
the rate of 1:25. For crops of six-months
duration, the recommended dose is 1-2 kg ha-1.
This can be increased to 2-4 kg ha
-1for crops
of more than six months duration. For perennial
crops, 10 to 25 g of the biofertilizer is to be
applied in the root zone during the first year
and 25 to 50 g during subsequent years. This
can be done at the time of sowing, transplanting
or during intercultivation.
Factors influencing the efficient use of
biofertilizers in Kerala
1. Use adequate quantity of organic
manure (as per the recommendation for
each crop) along with biofertilizer
application. This is essential to ensure better
survival, growth and activity of the
introduced microbial inoculum in acidic
soils.
2. Liming is essential if the soil pH is
below 6.0. In moderately acidic soils,
the application of lime at the rate of
250 kg ha
-1 is recommended along with
biofertilizer treatment.
3. Irrigation is essential during summer months
after biofertilizer application to ensure the
survival of the introduced microbial
inoculum in the soil.
4. Since N biofertilizers can supplement only
a part of the nitrogen requirement of the
inoculated plant, low dose of nitrogen and
full doses of phosphorus and potassium as
per the recommendation may be applied.
This is essential to ensure better plant
growth and yield. Similarly, in the case of P
biofertilizers, the full doses of nitrogen and
potassium should be applied. However,
there should be a gap of at least one week
between application of biofertilizer and
chemical fertilizer.
5. Use only biofertilizers, which are
manufactured as per the quality
para-meters prescribed by the Bureau of
Indian Standards. In the case of bacterial
biofertilizers, the prescribed standard is that
in the final product, the population of the
desired bacterium should not be
less than ten million per gram of the
carrier material and there should not be
any contamination with other micro-
organisms when examined at 1:100000
dilution. Further, it should have a shelf life
of at least six months.
6.
The commercially available biofertilizer
should always be used before the expiry
date marked on the culture packet.
7.
Top dressing with superphosphate
at the rate of 25 kg ha
-1 10 days after
inoculation of BGA will enhance its growth
under field conditions.
8.
Since the occurrence of green algae in rice
field can affect the normal growth and
proliferation of BGA, the population of
green algae should be controlled initially
by applying copper sulphate at the rate of
4 kg ha
-1.
313
BIOFERTILIZERS
9. In moderately acidic soils of pH around
6.5, root nodulation by Rhizobium and
Bradyrhizobium can be improved by
pelleting with finely powdered calcium
carbonate. (See recommendation under
cowpea)
10. Application of P2O5 at the rate of
1 kg ha
-1 is recommended once in 4 days
in P2O5 deficient soils to ensure good
growth of azolla. The development of a
reddish purple colour in azolla is a typical
symptom of P2O5 deficiency.
11. Since a floating population of azolla can
release its bound nutrients only during
decay in the soil, it is essential to
incorporate azolla in the soil prior to the
transplanting of rice seedlings.

GUIDELINES FOR MAXIMIZING FERTILIZER USE
EFFICIENCY
Choice of a fertilizer depends on unit cost
of nutrient present in it and its agronomic
efficiency under a given situation. Fertilizer is
a valuable input and measures should be taken
to reduce its losses and to increase its uptake
and utilisation by the crop. Selecting a situa-
tion-specific fertilizer and choosing the time and
method of application according to crop
demand would minimize losses and
increase its efficiency.
Nitrogenous fertilizers
Most crop plants recover only 25-35 per
cent of the nitrogen applied as fertilizers.
Losses occur by ammonia volatilisation,
denitrification, immobilization to organic forms,
leaching and run off. Utmost care should
be bestowed in selecting the type of
fertilizer as well as the timing and method of
application.
Choice of the nitrogen fertilizer
1. In submerged rice soil, ammoniacal and
ammonia producing fertilizers like urea are
most suitable since ammonia is the most
stable form of nitrogen under such
conditions.
2. For acidic upland soils, ammoniacal
fertilizers are most suitable during rainy
season since ammonium is adsorbed on soil
particles and hence leaching losses are
reduced. Adsorbed ammonium is gradually
released for nitrification and thus
becomes available to crops for a longer
period.
3. In highly acidic upland soils, urea is
preferred to ammonium sulphate as the
former is less acid forming.
4. In alkaline upland soils of low rainfall
regions, nitrate fertilizers are preferred to
ammoniacal fertilizers or urea since
ammonia may be lost by volatilization
under alkaline conditions.
Management of nitrogenous fertilizers
1. Almost all the nitrogenous fertilizers are
highly amenable to losses and since most
of the crops require nitrogen during the
entire growth period, split application is
necessary to ensure maximum utilization by
crops.
2. More number of splits may be given for
long duration crops as well as perennial crops.
3. Nitrogen losses from fertilizers are more
in coarse textured soils with low
cation exchange capacity (CEC) than in fine
textured soils. Hence more number of splits
is necessary to reduce loss of fertilizer
nitrogen from sandy and other light soils.
4. For medium duration rice varieties,
nitrogenous fertilizers should be given in
three splits, as basal, at maximum tillering
and at panicle initiation stage.
5. In coarse textured sandy or loamy soils, the
entire dose of nitrogenous fertilizers may
be applied in 3-4 splits at different stages
of growth of rice crop.
6. In areas where split application of
nitrogen is not feasible due to water
stagnation after planting/sowing, full dose
of nitrogen as basal may be given in the
form of neem coated or coal tar coated
urea.
7. In double cropped wetlands, 50 per cent of
N requirement of the first crop may be
applied in the organic form.
315
GUIDELINES FOR MAXIMIZING FERTILIZER USE EFFICIENCY
8. As far as possible, liming should be done
one or two weeks prior to the application
of ammoniacal or ammonia forming
fertilizer like urea since ammonia is likely
to be lost by volatilization if applied along
with lime.
9. Almost 70 per cent of N in urea applied
by broadcast to flooded soil is lost by
volatilization, immobilization and by
denitrification
Measures to reduce the loss of N from
applied urea
1. Urea super granules or urea briquettes may
be used in places where soil is clayey and
has cation exchange capacity more than
10 cmol (+) per kg of soil.
2. Sulphur or lac coated urea is suitable where
soil is liable to intermittent flooding and in
situations where water management is
difficult. This is more suitable for direct
sown crop.
3. Urea may be mixed with moist soil and kept
for 24-48 hours before application to the
field. Alternatively, urea may be mixed with
moist soil, made into balls of about three
inch diameter and dried under shade. The
balls may be placed deep into subsoil.
4. Mixing urea with one fifth its weight of
neem cake (5:1) prolongs the period of
nitrogen availability to the crop.
5. For submerged soils, coating urea with coal
tar and kerosene (100 kg urea is mixed with
2 kg coal tar dissolved in one litre
kerosene) before mixing with neem cake
is preferred to simple mixing with neem
cake.
6. Coating urea with neem extract (contain-
ing about 5 per cent neem triterpenes) at
1 per cent rate and shade drying for 1 to
1.5 hours before applying in direct seeded
puddled lowland rice increases nitrogen use
efficiency.
7. As far as possible, urea may be applied by
deep placement or plough sole placement.
Deep placement of prilled urea or super
granules during the last ploughing followed
by flooding and planting is beneficial in light
soils. Urea briquettes or super granules may
be placed between four hills of transplanted
rice, whereas sulphur coated or lac coated
urea may be broadcast on the surface.
8. Foliar spray of 5 per cent urea solution can
be practised in situations where quick
response to applied nitrogen is required. If
power sprayers are used, the concentra-
tion may be increased to 15 per cent. Fresh
urea should be used to avoid toxicity due to
biuret.
Phosphatic fertilizers
Fertilizer phosphorus is an expensive
input and its management poses serious
problems due to several complexities in its
behaviour in different types of soil. This often
results in its poor recovery from applied
fertilizers.
Choice of phosphatic fertilizer
1. In slightly acid, neutral or mildly alkaline
soils, water soluble phosphatic fertilizers are
more suitable.
2. In wetland rice soils, water soluble phos-
phatic fertilizers are preferable as pH of
most of the submerged soils is near neutral.
3. In strongly acidic soils whose pH does not
rise above 5.5 to 6.0 even on submergence,
phosphatic fertilizers containing citrate soluble
form of P like basic slag, dicalcium
phosphate, steamed bone meal etc. are
suitable.
4. For highly acidic upland soils or
submerged soils whose pH will not rise
GUIDELINES FOR MAXIMIZING FERTILIZER USE EFFICIENCY
316
above 5.5 even on submergence,
powdered rock phosphate is suitable. Soil
acidity converts tricalcium phosphate in
rock phosphate to plant available
monocalcium form.
5. For short duration crops where quick
response is required, water soluble
phosphatic fertilizers are most suitable.
6. For perennial crops like rubber, oil palm,
coffee, tea, cardamom etc. phosphorus in
the form of rock phosphate can be
applied.
7. In black soil (Chittur taluk of Palakkad
District) phosphatic fertilizers containing
water soluble phosphate like single
superphosphate are most suitable.
Management of phosphatic fertilizers
1. Acid soils have to be amended with lime,
dolomite or magnesium silicate and
alkali soils with iron pyrite or sulphur
before application of phosphatic fertilizers.
This will help to reduce fixation and increase
availability of P.
2. Surface application or broadcasting is
preferred for shallow rooted crops whereas
placement in the root zone is advantageous
in deep rooted crops.
3. Rock phosphates can be used advanta-
geously in rice, grown in acid soils
during the virippu season. Powdered rock
phosphate may be applied and mixed
thoroughly with soil by ploughing. After two
or three weeks, the field may be flooded,
worked up and planted with rice. Under this
situation, phosphorus in rock phosphate gets
converted to iron phosphate, which on
subsequent waterlogging becomes available
to the rice crop.
4. When soil available P status is medium to
high P application can be skipped. For low
P status soil , P should be applied @ 45 kg
P2O5 ha-1 .
5. K status of soil is maintained by straw
incorporation. After straw incorporation, if
soil analysis prior to cropping season
indicates low K status, K should be applied
@ 15 kg K2O ha -1.
6. Rock phosphate can be used successfully
as a phosphatic source for leguminous
crop since its root system can extract
phosphorous from rock phosphate.
7. In single crop wetlands where rice is grown
in the virippu season, application of
phosphatic fertilizers can be dispensed with
for the rice crop, if the second crop
(usually legume or green manure) is given
phosphatic fertilizers.
8. In case of rice-legume cropping sequence
in acid soils, application of rock
phosphate to the pulse crop helps to skip
phosphatic fertilizers in the succeeding rice
crop.
9. Since phosphorus requirement of seasonal
crops is confined to the early stages,
phosphatic fertilizers are to be applied
at the time of seeding or planting. Top
dressing of phosphatic fertilizer leads to
wastage of the fertilizer nutrient. Further,
excessive phosphates may lead to
deficiency of micronutrients such as zinc,
boron etc.
10.Under adverse soil conditions and where
quick result is required, spraying
water-soluble phosphatic fertilizers like
triple superphosphate or hot water extract
of superphosphate can be resorted to.
Potassium fertilizers
For most crops, potassium can be
supplied as muriate of potash. But in crops like
tobacco and potato, muriate of potash may
cause chloride injury, reducing quality of the
produce. In such cases, K may be applied as
potassium sulphate.

GUIDELINES FOR MAXIMIZING FERTILIZER USE EFFICIENCY
GUIDELINES FOR MAXIMIZING FERTILIZER USE EFFICIENCYAND BEEKEEPING
318
BEEKEEPING (APICULTURE)
True honey bees belong to the family
Apidae and genus Apis. They are social
insects living in colonies. A colony consists of
a queen, several thousand workers and a few
hundred drones. There is division of labour and
specialization in the performance of various
functions. They build nests (combs) with wax
secreted from the wax glands of worker bees.
The bees use these cells to rear their brood
and store food. Honey is stored in the upper
part of the comb; beneath it are rows of pollen
storage cells, worker brood cells and drone
brood cells in that order. Some Apis species
build single comb in open, while others build
multiple combs in dark cavities.
Species of honeybees
There are four species of honeybees in
India. They are:
Rock bee (Apis dorsata): They are giant bees
found all over India in sub-mountainous
regions up to an altitude of 2700 m. They build
single comb nests with an area up to
1 m2 or more. They are good honey gatherers
with an average yield of 50-80 kg per colony.
Little bee (Apis florea): They are the
smallest of the true honeybees found in plains
Management of potassium fertilizers
1. In coarse textured soils and in heavy
rainfall regions, potassium fertilizers should
be applied in as many splits as possible, to
reduce loss of potassium.
2. In fine textured soils, the entire dose of
potassium fertilizers may be applied as
basal.
3. In acid soils, potassium fertilizers should be
applied only after lime application to
prevent loss of potassium by leaching.
Lime
Acid soils are characterised by high
saturation of the exchange complex with
hydrogen and aluminium. Crops grown in such
soils suffer due to unavailability of most plant
nutrients, especially calcium. Application of
liming materials increases the availability of
nutrients and alleviates Ca deficiency.
Liming materials
Burnt lime [CaO], slaked lime [Ca (OH)2],
powdered limestone [CaCO3] and dolomite
[CaMg (CO3)2] are some of the materials used
as sources of calcium.
Management
1. In acidic submerged soils, flooding brings
about rise in soil pH and hence response to
lime is less marked.
2. Legumes are benefitted most by liming.
3. For better results, liming materials should
be incorporated into the soil.
4. For seasonal crops and in situations where
immediate results are required, burnt
lime or slaked lime may be used. For
perennial crops, powdered lime stone or
dolomite is sufficient.
5. Extreme care should be taken while
broadcasting burnt lime and slaked lime as
they can cause scorching of leaves.
6. In case of wetland rice, drain the field prior
to lime application and reflood
after 24 hours. Flushing the soil by
sequential flooding and draining will help to
wash out the displaced acid from the soil.
7. In extreme case of calcium deficiency,
1 per cent solution of calcium chloride may
be applied by foliar spraying.
319
BEEKEEPING
of India up to the altitude of 500 m. They build
single vertical combs. They are poor honey
yielders and yield about 200 – 900 g of honey
per colony.
Indian bee (Apis cerana indica): They are
the domesticated species, which construct
multiple parallel combs with an average honey
yield of 6-8 kg per colony per year.
European bee / Italian bee (Apis melli fera):
They are also similar in habits to
Indian bees and build parallel combs. They are
bigger than all other honeybees except Apis
dorsata. The average production per colony
is 25 – 40 kg.
Stingless bee (Trigona iridipennis): In
addition to the above, another species is also
present in Kerala known as stingless bees.
They are not truly stingless, but the sting is poorly
developed. They make nests in the ground,
hollows of trees, bamboo, rocks or cracks of
walls. Honey and brood cells are separate in
the nest. They are efficient pollinators. They
yield 300-400 g of honey per year.
Swarming
Swarming is the natural instinct of
honeybees to reproduce its colonies. By
swarming, strong colonies are divided
naturally. It occurs mostly when the colony
population is at its peak. Some of the
several reasons for swarming are sudden
honey flow, sudden failure of queen to lay eggs,
congestion in the colony, want of breeding
space, bad ventilation etc. Dividing the colonies
or keeping young queen or preventing over
crowding of bees or adding new combs can
prevent swarming.
Absconding
Absconding is the total desertion of colony
from its nest due to incidence of
disease / pest attack, too much interference
by human beings or robbing of honey by bees
from other colonies. Proper hive management
can prevent it.
Communication
The worker bees communicate with other
bees about the exact location of nectar,
pollen, water, next nesting site etc. by means
of dances. Round dance is performed when
the food is located within 100 m from hive and
wagtail dance to communicate the location of
food source when it is more than 100 m away
from the hive.
Bee space
It is the space large enough to permit the
free passage for worker bees but too small to
encourage bees building a comb and too large
for bees to deposit propolis in it.
Indian bee (Apis cerana indica)
This is the domesticated hive bee in Kerala.
A colony consists of a queen, 20,000 to 30,000
workers and a few drones. This species has
gentle temperament and responds to smoking.
Lack of flora leads to absconding by bees. It
also has a strong tendency for swarming. It
yields 8-10 kg of honey per colony per year.
Bee-box
ISI Type-A box is recommended for the
State of Kerala. A division board may be added
to the bee box for adjusting the internal space
depending on the strength of the colony. It can
be procured from beekeepers. Wild feral
colonies can be hived. Beekeepers in different
regions use local hives made of low cost wood.
The wood should not have a strong smell. Kail
(Pinus excelsa), teak (Tectona grandis), toon
(Toona ciliata) anjili (Artocarpus hirsutus),
punna (Calophyllum inophyllum) etc., are
some of the suitable woods. The hives should
be preferably painted white on outside to
protect the timber from weathering.
 BEEKEEPING
320
Hiving wild colony
It is done during evening hours. Smoke the
colony slightly, cut out the combs one by one
and tie to the brood frames with
plantain fibre. Arrange them in the box.
Location of beehives
The apiary must be located in well-drained
open area, preferably near orchards, with
profuse source of nectar, pollen and water.
Windbreaks may be provided by planting
shrubs, flowering plants and also creepers like
antigonon. Shade must also be provided. Ant
wells are fixed around the hive stand. The
colonies must be directed towards east, with
slight changes in the directions of the bee box
as a protection from rain and sun. Keep the
colonies away from the reach of cattle, other
animal, busy roads and streetlights.
Management of colonies
Inspect the beehives at least once in a week
during brood rearing/honey-flow seasons
preferably during the morning hours. Bright,
warm and calm days are suitable. If sunlight
falls directly on the beehive spread cloth or a
towel over the same. Look for freshly laid eggs
to ensure that the colonies are healthy. Clean
the hive in the following sequence, the roof,
super/supers, brood chambers and floorboard.
Observe the colonies regularly for the presence
of healthy queen, brood development, storage
of honey and pollen, presence of queen cells,
bee strength and growth of drones. Look for
the infestation by any of the following bee
enemies.
Wax moth (Galleria mellonella): Remove
all the larvae and silken webbings from the
combs, corners and crevices of bee box.
Wax beetles (Platybolium sp.): Collect and
destroy the adult beetles.
Mites: Clean the frame and floorboard with
cotton swabs moistened with freshly made
potassium permanganate solution. Repeat until
no mites are seen on the floorboard.
Diseases: The dead larvae due to Thai sac
brood virus (TSBV) in the comb cells may be
removed and destroyed.
Management during lean season
Remove the supers and arrange the
available healthy broods compactly in the brood
chamber. Provide division board, if necessary.
Destroy queen cells and drone cells, if noted.
Provide sugar syrup (1:1) @ 200 g sugar per
colony per week for Indian bees. Feed all the
colonies in the apiary at the same time to avoid
robbing.
Management during honey flow season
Keep the colony in sufficient strength before
honey-flow season. Congestion in the hive must
be avoided and surplus honeybees are drawn
to supers. Provide maximum space between
the first super and the brood chamber and not
above the first super. Place queen excluder
sheets in between brood and super chamber
to confine the queen to brood chamber.
Examine the colony once in a week and frames
full of honey should be removed to the sides of
the super and such frames can be raised from
brood to super chamber. The frames, which
are three-fourth filled with honey or pollen and
one-fourth with sealed brood should be taken
out of brood chamber and in its place empty
combs or frames with foundation is added. The
frame with comb foundation should be placed
next to the brood nest. The combs, which are
completely sealed or two-third capped may be
taken out for extraction of honey and returned
to supers after honey extraction. This helps
the colonies to activate the bees to collect and
store more honey. Two or three such
extractions are possible during a surplus flow.
Extraction of uncapped honey will result in
fermentation. Honey extraction, after the flow
is over, should be avoided to save the bee
colonies from robbing. Care should be taken
to retain sufficient combs with honey in the
brood chamber or reduce the lean period.
321
BEEKEEPING
Migratory beekeeping
The moving of bee colonies from one place
to another to capture increased nectar flow of a
particular flora is called migratory beekeeping.
Copious flow of extra floral nectar available
on rubber trees during January-April is
exploited by shifting beecolonies to these
plantations during this period.
Similar practice is done in cashew
plantations and in other orchards too.
Maintaining bee colonies in orchards will
increase the yield, since pollination is more
efficient in such orchards.
Shifting of colonies is done after sun set.
Colonies should be prepared as follows.
Extract available honey and fasten all the weak
combs to frames with plantain fibres. Secure
the frames to the chamber with packing. Close
the bee entrance with cotton. Then secure the
bee-box (floorboard, brood chamber, supers
and roof) firmly with strong threads. Do not
tilt or topple beehives while stacking them in
the conveyance or during transit. Avoid strong
jerks and shocks while transporting.
Set up the beehives as described above at
the new site. Inspect the condition of combs
and tighten loose threads, if any. This inspection
should be done only in dim light. Next morning
remove the cotton plug at bee entrance. Later
provide comb foundation sheets, if necessary
and provide sufficient space for storage of
honey.
Extraction of honey
Honey is extracted only from super combs
using honey extractor. The sealing of cells on
combs is removed with sharp knife
before placing in the extractor. Extractor
should be worked slowly at the beginning and
at about 150 rpm at the end for about 1 to 2
minutes. Then the sides of the frames are
reversed and the extractor is again worked.
Extracted honey is filtered through muslin cloth.
Providing a bee escape between the brood and
super on the day prior to honey extraction keeps
the bees away from the super. Remove the
escape soon after honey extraction.
Processing of honey
Heat the honey to 45ºC by keeping it in a
water bath. Sieve it to remove wax particles,
debris, dust and pollen. Again heat it to a
temperature of 65ºC in water bath and maintain
it for 10 minutes. Then cool and filter it in
80-mesh muslin and store in glass, porcelain,
earthenware, enamelware or stainless steel
containers. Bulk storing can be made in mild
steel containers lined with bee wax.
Italian bee (Apis mellifera)
It is a native of Europe introduced to
Himachal Pradesh and Punjab during 1962-64
and introduced to Kerala on a trial basis from
Haryana in November 1992. It maintains a
prolific queen, swarms less, has gentle
temperament and is a good honey-gatherer. It
is known to be resistant to TSBV. A healthy
colony may contain 60,000 to 80,000 worker
bees. The following modifications are to be
followed in beekeeping with Italian bees.
Bee-box
Langstroth beehive with ten frames each
in brood and super chambers and a division
brood chamber is recommended. The brood
and super chambers are of the same size.
Procuring bee colonies
Colonies can be obtained either by
dividing existing colonies or by buying from
other agencies.
Location of beehives
Follow the practices as in Indian bees, but
use a strong four-legged stand well protected
from ants and other crawling insects by
providing ant wells.
Management of colonies
Apart from the management practices
followed for Indian bee, the practices as
 BEEKEEPING
322
mentioned below may be followed.
Sources of pure water should be available
near the apiary. Stagnant water or water in a
container is not appropriate because it can
spread nosema disease. Flowing water near
the apiary should serve as a good source. As
an alternative, water trickling from a
container set on a stand and falling on a
slanting wooden plank can be provided.
During the brood rearing season (growth
period) from October to January, replacement
of old queens by young healthy ones, uniting
the weak colonies and giving supplementary
feeding as and when required should be done.
Colonies should be provided with enough space
for brood rearing and food storage, by giving
comb foundation sheets one at a time.
In areas where queen mating is a
problem, especially when only a few colonies
are kept in isolated pockets, the colony with
virgin queen is to be transferred to areas where
more number of colonies are kept so as to
ensure the availability of queen in sufficient
numbers and afterwards returned to the former
apiary.
During honey flow season (January-April),
provide raised combs in the super and the
number of combs to be added depends on the
strength of the colony. Only ripe honey is
harvested when two-third of the comb cells
are capped so that honey contains less than
20 per cent moisture. Care should be taken to
see that the bee colonies are not stripped of all
the honey stores. Enough stores of honey
should be ensured in the hive at the end of
honey flow for use during the following lean
period. For migratory bee keeping, follow the
practices as adopted for Indian bees.
Extraction of honey
The sealing of comb is removed with a
sharp knife and the extraction done in an
extractor designed for langstroth size frames.
Extracted honey is filtered through a coarse
cloth to remove the impurities.
Processing of honey
To be done as described under Indian bees.
During the lean season (May-September),
remove the super chambers, arrange the
available healthy brood combs in the brood
chamber and use division boards to restrict the
space. Provide artificial feeding once in a week
by way of 1:1 sugar syrup in water. Each colony
may require syrup prepared from 500-750 g
sugar a week depending on the size of the
colony and availability of stored food. When
there is dearth of natural source, pollen
substitutes may be provided in the colony.
Pests and diseases
Brood mite (Tropilaelaps clareae): Infests
the brood and the infestation is severe during
the major brood rearing season (October-
January). These ectoparasites feed on the
haemolymph of developing broods slowly
killing them. Dusting sulphur on the topbars of
the frames @ 200 mg/ frame at 7-14 days
interval during brood rearing season is very
effective in checking the infestation.
Yellow-banded wasp (Vespa cincta): These
predatory wasps catch the bees from both the
hive entrance and inside the hives. Locating
and destroying their nests by burning or
insecticidal usage is an effective control
measure.
Wax moth (Galleria mellonella): Infests
weak and unattended colonies. Proper cleaning
of the hives periodically and keeping the hives
without cracks and crevices can avoid
infestation.
Black ants: Various species of black ants
intrude beehives and take away honey and
pollen and kill the brood and bees, which may
lead to absconding of colony. The apiary should
323
BEEKEEPING
be kept clean and the ant nests destroyed by
insecticidal applications. Ant wells should be
provided for the beehive stands.
Red tree-ant (Oecophyla smaragdina)
If not protected properly, the red tree-ants
can cause considerable damage to the bees
and the brood. The bees that come in
contact with the ground are attacked and killed
by the ants and dragged to their nests by a
number of ants. In the apiary, if the branch of
a tree with these ants happens to come in
contact with the hive, the entire colony is
attacked and destroyed. Providing ant wells
will keep away the ants. Care should be taken
not to keep the colonies near or under the trees
having ant nests.
Bee-eater bird (Merops orientalis)
These predatory birds do much harm in certain
localities. They pick the bees on wings and 30-
43 honeybees have been found in the stomach
of a bird. Attack by these birds is mostly seen
during December-January. These birds are also
very useful in keeping down the insect
population in a locality and hence no large-scale
measures against them can be recommended.
Scaring them away from apiaries is suggested.
Thai sac brood virus
Symptoms
All the larval instars are susceptible to the
disease, earlier instars being more susceptible.
Affected larvae appear slightly plumby
compared to healthy ones when examined on
taking out of the comb cells. The infected
larvae seen stretched on their back in the cells
with the head directed outwards and turned
upwards like the prow of a boat. The dead
larvae look like a sac filled with milky white
fluid when lifted up and it ruptures even with
the slight pressure releasing the milky fluid. The
cadavers change their colour from white to pale
yellow and sunk down to the floor of the cell
and dry up in 10-15 days as brownish black
boat shaped scales, which are easily removable
from the cells.
The sequence of visible symptoms found
in the field is:
1.
Presence of unsealed cells in brood area
containing diseased larvae with their head
directed outwards like the prow of a boat.
2.
Dead larvae are seen lying stretched out
on their back on the floor of brood cells
and look like a sac filled with milky white
fluid when lifted up.
3.
Appearance of dead larvae strewn on the
floorboards, hive entrance or on the floor
near the hive.
4.
Mottled appearance of brood combs with
uncapped cells interspersed with capped
cells or cells with perforated capping.
5.
Appearance of more and more dead
larvae left within the cells without being
ejected by the worker bees.
6.
Appearance of sac like remnants of dead
larvae within the cells.
7.
Lack of cleaning activity within the hive.
8.
Decrease in egg laying rate and irregular
placement of eggs.
9.
Decrease in foraging activity and
presence of idling workers inside the hive.
10.
Dwindling of bee population of the colony.
11.
Desertion of infected hives by the bees
causing total loss to the apiary.
Management
Being a virus disease there is no known
remedy. However, the following measures may
help in minimizing the possibilities of
further spread: a) Keep colonies strong;
b) avoid exchange of hive parts, combs etc.
from infected colonies to healthy colonies;
c) avoid procurement of colonies or swarms
from infected areas.
SERICULTURE
Moriculture
Mulberry can be grown under various
climatic conditions ranging from temperate to
tropical. Its growth depends on many
climatic conditions such as temperature,
humidity, rainfall etc. A temperature range of
24-28ºC, humidity range of 65-80 per cent and
600-2500 mm rainfall are ideal for
optimum growth of mulberry. The soil should
be deep, fertile, well drained, clay loam to loam
and with good moisture holding capacity.
Slightly acidic (6.2-6.8 pH) soil free from
injurious salts is ideal for the growth of
mulberry.
Land preparation
The field is levelled and ploughed deeply
before the onset of monsoon. FYM may be
applied @ 10 t ha-1 for the rainfed crop and
20 t ha-1 for the irrigated crop during land
preparation.
Method of planting and spacing
(a) Pit system (rainfed crop): Spacing
75 cm x 75 cm (pit size 30 cm x 30 cm x
30 cm). (b) Row system (irrigated crop):
Spacing 60 cm x 60 cm (ridges and furrows).
Planting material
The variety K2 gives higher yield and
better quality leaves. Cuttings must be
prepared from shoots of proper maturity (6-8
months) and thickness with well developed
buds. Cuttings of 7-10 cm length and pencil
thickness with 3 or 4 active buds are ideal.
Planting
For irrigated crop, two cuttings should
be planted at each spot along the margin
of the ridge.
For rainfed crop, three cuttings are to be
planted per pit in a triangular manner with a
distance of 15 cm, keeping only one bud
exposed.
Maintenance of the garden (1st year)
After 8 months of planting, 50 kg each of
N, P2O5 and K2O  should be applied per ha
after weeding. First harvest can be taken six
months after planting by leaf picking.
Second dose of 50 kg N per ha should be
applied 8 weeks after the first leaf harvest.
Two more crops can be taken at an interval of
3 months, by leaf picking.
Manuring
For rainfed crop apply FYM @ 10 t ha-1
as a basal dose and topdress every year at the
time of annual pruning. Fertilizers are
applied @ 130:65:65 kg ha
-1 of N:P2O5:K2O in
two split doses. For irrigated crop, FYM is given
@ 20 t ha
-1 as basal dose. Fertilizers are applied
@ 300:120:120 kg ha
-1 of N: P2O5: K2O in five
split doses.
Pruning
For rainfed crop, bottom pruning is done in
May-June. Two top clippings in August/
September and December/January are also
practised. Middle pruning is done in
October/November. For irrigated crop,
bottom pruning at 15-30 cm height in May, two
top clippings in August and December and two
middle pruning at 60 cm height in October and
February/March are practised.
Pests
Tussock caterpillars (Euproctis fraterna)
Larvae eat the leaves of the mulberry plant.
Their incidence is frequent during March
to August. Collection and destruction of egg

masses and spraying 1 per cent DDVP are
effective. Waiting period is 3 days.
Jassids (Empoasca flarescens)
Greenish hoppers feed on the underside of
the leaf, suck  sap and cause hopper burn.
Spraying 0.05 per cent dimethoate is
effective. Waiting period is 10 days.
Thrips
These are frequent during summer
season. Attack is severe in rainfed gardens.
Spraying 0.02 per cent DDVP is effective.
Waiting period is 3 days.
Mealy bugs (Maconelliococcus hirsutus)
It causes ‘tukra disease’. The affected
leaves show curling and stunted growth at the
growing point.
Scale insect
When attack is severe, branches dry and
become yellow. Spraying lime sulphur
solution is effective.
Leaf eating caterpillar (Diacrisia obliqua)
Appears frequently between November
and January. Collection and destruction of egg
masses, deep ploughing and flood
irrigation to kill the pupae and application of
0.05 per cent DDVP on the leaves can
prevent the attack.
Root knot disease (Meloidogyne incognita)
Common in sandy loam type of soil
under irrigated conditions. Controlled by
applying neem oil cake at the rate of 400 kg
per ha per year in four equal split doses.
Diseases
Powdery mildew (Phyllactina corylea)
It is more common during November-
February. White powdery patches appear on
the lower side of the leaves.
Leaf rust (Ceratelicum fici)
The attacked portion of the leaves have
whitish brown pustules on both sides, are
deformed and non-nutritive. Infection is
more in November-February. This can be
controlled by spraying carbendazim 0.05 per
cent or tridemorph 0.08per cent.
Leaf spot (Cercospora moricola)
Diseased leaves have a number of
circular or irregular brownish black spots of
varying size. Infection is more common in rainy
season. This can be controlled by spraying
0.05per cent of carbendazim.
Yield
Rainfed crop
: 12000-15000 kg/ha/year
Irrigated crop : 25000-30000 kg/ha/year
Silkworm rearing
Requirements for silkworm rearing
1. Good quality mulberry leaves
2. Rearing house of approximately 20 m
2 for
100 dfls (disease free layings), with good
ventilation, mild temperature (24-28ºC) and
humidity (65-85 per cent).
3. Rearing equipments like chawki stand
(one), wooden trays (10), rearing racks (5),
chopping board (one) and knife, wooden/
bamboo rearing trays (50), chandrika/
netrika (mountage) (40), leaf chamber,
feeding stands, ant wells, rocker sprayer,
wet and dry bulb thermometer and materials
like formaldehyde / bleaching powder,
paraffin paper, cleaning nets, foam rubber
strips and RKO powder are required.
Rearing techniques
Disinfect the rearing house and
equipments two-three days before rearing to
prevent silkworm disease.  First, wash the
rearing house and the equipments with 2 per

cent bleaching powder. Then spray the room
and equipments with 5 per cent bleaching
powder or 2 per cent formaldehyde. Keep the
rearing houses closed  for 24 hours for the
fumes to get diffused.
First incubate the dfls (egg card) at a
temperature of 24-26ºC and RH of 75-80 per
cent, one day prior to hatching (blue egg stage);
cover the eggs with black paper (black boxing).
Next day morning, open it and expose to
diffused sunlight. As the larvae emerge out,
fresh tender leaves collected from the plant
are chopped into 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm size and
sprinkled over the hatched larvae. After half
an hour, transfer the larvae to the paraffin paper
spread in the chawky trays (wooden trays)
using fine brush. Provide wet foam strips
around and prepare a compact bed. Give
another feeding in the bed. Cover with paraffin
paper and stack the trays one over the other
on the stand. Upto 20 layings can be brushed
in a tray of 90 cm x 60 cm.
At the end of each instar, larvae stop
feeding and cast off old skin in 18-30 hours.
When the worms set for moulting, paraffin
paper should be removed and spread on the
bed to dry up. If there are more feeding worms,
a light and thin feeding may be given. All the
worms settle in 6-8 hours. During moulting,
worms should not be disturbed and full
ventilation should be provided. Feeding is
resumed when 90 per cent of worms have
moulted. RKO powder is dusted over the
worms 30 minutes before feeding. After two
consecutive feedings, the larvae with the net
are transferred to a new tray. Mature larvae
stop feeding and prepare themselves for
spinning. Its body becomes translucent, shrinks
in length and constrictions appear on 4
th and
5
th segments. They move towards the
periphery of the trays. Such worms are picked
and transferred to Chandrika / Netrakae. About
1000 worms (400-450 larvae/m2) can be
mounted in a mountage. Mount the entire
larvae within a maximum period of 48 hours
and provide sufficient ventilation during
spinning. Cocoon should be harvested on the
fifth and sixth day after mounting. In rainy and
cold seasons, it should be delayed for one more
day. The cocoons are collected from Chandrika
and transported in light gunny bags to cocoon
market. The cocoon should be marketed
immediately after harvest, so as to avoid adult
emergence. Under average conditions, 100 dfls
of bivoltine will yield 40-60 kg cocoons and
cross breed will yield 30-50 kg cocoons.
Diseases
Pebrine
It is the most destructive disease of silk
worms and is  caused by protozoa, Nosema
bombyscis. The worms become inactive with
poor appetite, the skin becomes wrinkled and
moulting becomes irregular.
Flacherie
It is caused by bacteria and poor rearing
conditions like high temperature, high humidity,
poor ventilation, bad leaf quality, over
feeding etc. aggravates the disease. Digestive
and circulatory systems are damaged and the
symptoms are loss of appetite and diarrhoea.
327
 SERICULTURE AND RODENTS AND THEIR CONTROL
RODENTS AND THEIR CONTROL
Rats are important non-insect pests and
can be grouped into two different groups as
domestic rats and field rats.
Domestic rats
These are found near human dwellings.
1.  House rats (Rattus rattus): There are
two subspecies; one with white belly and the
other with grey belly. Tail length is more than
the length of head and body. They are found in
houses and eat anything that man eats. They
also cause qualitative damage by deposition of
faecal matter, urine and hairs. It damages
gunny bags, plastic containers, clothes,
electric wires etc. House rats damage tender
coconuts and cocoa pods in  the fields. They
also act as carriers of several human and
animal diseases.
2.  House mouse (Mus musculus): Fur is
short without spines. Tail is almost naked and
larger than head and body. The mouse is very
active and is found in houses and gardens. It
can climb up walls. It damages clothes, plastic
containers and food materials.
3. Large bandicoot rat (Bandicota
indica): This is the largest domestic rat. Fur is
Grasserie
Mostly seen in ripening larvae. Caused by
Borrelina virus. Infection is induced by
extreme low and high temperature.
Swelling of the inter-segmental region,
shining skin, rupture of body wall, oozing
of body fluid and endless crawling are
symptoms. Such worms do not moult and spin.
Muscardine
The fungi Beauveria bassiana, Spicaria
prasina and Isaria farinosa are the causal
agents. The infected larvae lose appetite.
Specks of oozing oily substance without any
clear-cut margins appear on the skin. Body
generally hardens and becomes stiff.
Prevention and control
1. Disinfect the rearing room and equipment
before rearing.
2. Use only disease free layings from
authorized agencies.
3. Dip the egg cards in 2 per cent formalin
solution for 20 minutes before incubation.
4. Collect undersized larvae and destroy
regularly by burning or burrowing in soil.
5. Feed good quality leaves of correct stages.
6. Avoid over feeding and under feeding
7. Clean the bed every day and burn the
infested litter.
8. Use RKO powder at every moulting before
resumption of feeding.
9. Maintain humidity only to the desired level.
Pests
Uzi-fly (Trycholyga bombycis)
It is a serious parasite of silkworm larvae
and pupae causing heavy loss. Adult is a large
fly with prominent black and grey stripes. The
fly prefers later instars to the earlier ones for
oviposition.
Management
Prevent the entry of fly into the rearing
room by providing wire mesh or nylon net on
doors and ventilators. Burn the parasitized
larvae. Apply chlorpyrifos on the ground and
crevices of walls of rearing house. Other pests
include ants, lizards, rats, squirrels, dermestid
beetles and birds.
RODENTS AND THEIR CONTROL
328
coarse. Tail length is almost equal to the body
length. Body weight ranges from 750 to 1000 g.
It damages all tuber crops. It also damages
concrete buildings by making burrows under
the basement.
Field rats
1.  Large bandicoot rat (B. indica): Large
bandicoot rats are also seen in the field. So
this can be considered both as domestic and
field rat.
2.  Lesser bandicoot rat (B. bengalensis): It is
a short tailed mole rat. Tail length is only
70 per cent of the body length. Fur is short and
coarse. It is seen making burrows in the paddy
field bunds and also in areas where crops like
tubers, vegetables, coconut and young rubber
are cultivated.
3.  Field mouse (Mus booduga): Fur is short
and coarse and is mostly found in
gardens and fields. Tail is slender and nearly
naked. Tail length is shorter than body and head.
The burrows of this species are found in the
paddy fields. They are found feeding on paddy
grains in the mature crop as well as on seeds
sown in the nursery.
4. White rat (Tatera indica): More than one
rat per burrow is common in this species. The
eyes are large. The tail is longer than the body
and is provided with a terminal tuft of long hairs.
It is double coloured.
5.  Long tailed tree mouse (Vande-leuria
oleracea): The fur is soft and tail is much
longer than the body. They are found in most
parts of India inhabiting trees and shrubs. They
damage the inflorescence of arecanut and
leafy vegetables by cutting its leaves.
6. Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus): These
rats are found in waterlogged areas. This is a
medium sized rat with tail more or less equal
to the length of the head and body. These rats
damage paddy crop. It cuts the plants at the
base and chews the cut portion. Maximum
attack is at the booting stage. The attack
ceases after initiation of flowering. The
damage is usually observed in patches away
from the field bunds.
7. Soft furred field rat (Millardia meltada):
These rats are found in cultivated field in pairs
or small groups of 5 or 6. They are soft furred
without spines. These rats cut the rice plants
in the transplanted crop. The damage starts at
the time of planting and continues up to
harvest. The tillers are cut at the water level.
8. Bush rat (Golunda elliotti): These rats
are seen in places near forest area. They live
under bushes in nests. These rats are
destructive to coffee plants. They feed on their
buds and flowers. They damage paddy by
cutting the plants in dryland paddy areas.
Integrated control of field rats
Rats cause considerable damage to
agricultural practices and other human
possessions in addition to acting as carriers of
several human and animal diseases.
Diseases like bubonic plague and weils
disease (due to contamination of food by the
urine of rats) are caused by rats. It is
necessary that the  importance  of  rat  control
be understood by all. An integrated approach
to control rats involves the joint utilisation
of all feasible control measures in a
complementary manner to maintain the rat
population at a very low level. Integrated
control of field rats involves the following: (a)
preventing their entry into a region or a
building by putting up mechanical barriers or
treating with repellents; (b) encouraging
predators such as snakes, cats, dogs,
mongooses etc.; (c) causing death by a variety
of methods.
329
RODENTS AND THEIR CONTROL
Methods of control
Environmental control
In this method of control rats are rendered
to a hostile environment in which they cannot
survive. The mud walls in villages may be
replaced by thorny hedges thereby preventing
the rats from making burrows. Good house
keeping is regarded as the most economical
and effective way of reducing rat population.
Proper sanitation should be maintained by
keeping food material inaccessible to rats in
rat proof containers. The heap of garbage and
sweepings in streets and towns should not be
kept for a long period. Designing rat proof
godowns and other buildings is another step to
ensure environmental control.
Poisoning
Three types of poisoning are usually
employed to control rats.
1. Acute poisons are those that can kill rats
with a single dose; eg. zinc phosphide.
2. Multiple dose or chronic poisons
require repeated ingestion over several
succes- sive days; eg. anticoagulants.
3. Fumigants are gases and are usually
pumped or released from pellets or
tablets put in through burrow entrances.
Zinc phosphide
It is a dark grey powder and its toxic
action is due to release of phosphine gas. When
it is ingested, phosphine is released causing
injury to the kidneys, liver and lungs
followed by death after a few hours. Zinc
phosphide is used in food baits containing
2 per cent active ingredient.
Pre-baiting for 3-4 days consecutively is
necessary to overcome bait shyness. For
pre-baiting and baiting, the same carrier
material has to be used. Crushed wheat, maize,
bajra, puffed rice, popcorn or rice mixed with a
little jaggery and oil are excellent carriers. To
prepare the carrier, 95 parts by weight of cereal
ingredient is to be mixed with 5 parts of jaggery.
For baiting, zinc phosphide is mixed with
groundnut oil and carrier in the ratio 2:2:96 by
weight. At each bait station, 30-40 g of the
bait mixture will have to be exposed. The
stations may be selected in areas where rats
are frequent, such as areas around kitchen,
store and in homesteads. Expose baits in the
evening and collect them in the following
morning. Conduct baiting for three successive
days.
Repellents
Chemical repellents include malathion
and cyclohexamide which are repellents to
house rats.
Biological control
Both field and domestic rats are subjected
to attack by a range of predators, parasites
and pathogens. The  predators  include  cats,
dogs, snakes, owls, mongooses etc. The
practice of rearing cats in house has been found
to adversely affect rat population. The
utilization of microbial pathogens has not proved
successful in any part of the world.
Trapping
Trapping is the oldest method of
controlling rodents. Almost any trap will catch
some rats, but the response varies with
different species. The rats are easily caught in
cage or box, but a rat trapped in such trap will
be exposed to other rats which  develop trap
shyness and they avoid such type of traps. The
most effective rat traps are those, which can
completely conceal the rats trapped in it; eg.
Moncompu trap. The rat traps can be grouped
into a few categories.
RODENTS AND THEIR CONTROL
330
Live traps (cage or box trap)
1. Automatic traps: These have counter
balanced entrances. When an animal
enters this type of traps, its weight makes
it fall into a cage below. The counter
balance on the trap door brings it back into
place, leaving the rodent in the cage. These
are intended to catch more than one rat;
eg. wonder trap.
2. Remote triggered trap: These work by
upsetting a delicate balance when the bait
stick is disturbed or when the weight is put
on a treadle. Common type of this is the
box or cage trap that captures one rat at a
setting. A box trap is a wooden or metal
box open at one or both ends, having one
or two doors. Some have one or both will
have overhead trigger on which bait is
fastened and the door is released when the
rat works on the bait. Others have a treadle
in the floor on which the rat steps to drop
the door.
3. Glues: A form of trapping in which a sticky
substance entangles the animal.
4. Pot traps: These traps are extensively used
for catching rice field rats. This trap
consists of a wooden plank, a mud pot of
10 inch diameter, a metal strip which carry
bait and a ‘Y’shaped wooden peg to which
needle is tied; eg. Moncompu trap.
The trap is to be set up in rice fields,
after placing the base plank above the canopy
level on a specially erected platform, on poles.
The rats attracted by the bait climb over to the
base plank and try to snatch off the bait tied
on to the metallic strip. Slight disturbance of the
strip dislocates the wooden needle from the
strip slot and causes the pot to fall down
abruptly over the rat. The pot and the plank
are tightly held and removed in that position
and immersed in water after inversion for
killing the trapped rat. Since the live rat does
not see the captured ones, they do not
develop shyness against this type of
mechanical trap.
5. Snap traps: Most of the rat traps fall within
this category and are widely used for
trapping rats. These kill the rat instantly by
snapping shut when the rat nibbles at the
bait placed in the middle of the open trap.
These are variously called as “break back
traps”, “guillotine”, “spring traps”, “saw
toothed traps” and “bamboo traps”
depending upon the materials used in
making them.
6. Kerosene tin trap: It is made by cutting the
top of the tin and filling it with water up to
15 cm from the top. Chaff is floated on the
water surface so that the rat cannot see
water. Attractive and strong smelling bait
like dry fish, fried coconut etc. is pinned on
to a piece of cork or lightwood and floated
on the chaff. A plank is leaned against the
side to enable the rat to climb to the top.
Seeing no water and eager to get the bait
the rat jumps on to the chaff and gets
drowned.
Success or failure of trapping is dependent
up on the following factors.
a. Placement: Traps must be placed where
animals will regularly encounter them.
b. Concealment: It is not advisable to use new
shining traps against rats. To overcome trap
shyness it may sometimes be necessary to
cover the trap with a slight coating of paper
or dry leaves that does not interfere with
the trigger or action.
c. Size and design: Traps should be neither too
small nor too large for the anticipated catch.
d. Mechanical conditions: Putting out traps
that are in poor working conditions is a
waste of time and effort.
e. Number of traps: Large number of traps
331
RODENTS AND THEIR CONTROL, CONTROL OF LORANTHUS AND BIOCONTROL .....
relative to the expected size of the rodent
population should be used.
f. Bait used: Fresh aromatic bait that is most
attractive to the largest species should be
used. Food grains in the houses should be
properly covered so that the rat finds only
the food in the trap.
Trapping is the preferred method of
control in the houses and office building,
because animals that get killed can be easily
removed. Traps can be used profitably to deal
with poison-shy and scattered survivors of
poison campaign.
Control of important species of rats
Lesser bandicoot rat: These attacking
tuber crops can be easily controlled by poison
baiting in rodent burrows. Firstly, locate the
burrows in the field. Open the burrows to a
length of 30 to 45 cm. The rats will come and
close the burrows with soil within 30 minutes.
Then it can be again opened and poison bait
can be inserted into the burrow.
From bait preference studies indicate that,
prawn powder as the most effective bait. Dry
prawn available in the market is heated and
powdered. A few drops of vegetable oil are
added and zinc phosphide 1-2 per cent  is mixed
with the bait. This zinc phosphide bait can be
put inside the burrow preferably on a dry leaf.
No pre-baiting is necessary for these rats in
the garden lands since it has no bait shyness.
Norway rat: The most effective method of
control has been found to be the Moncompu
trap. Firstly,  fresh rat-damages in the field have
to be located. The rats have a habit of visiting
the same area on subsequent days. Hence the
traps should be placed in such spots.
BIOCONTROL OF SALVINIA (Salvinia molesta)
Release of Cyrtobagous salviniae
weevils is found effective for the control of
salvinia. Even one pair of weevil is sufficient
for establishment in a locality. But for
practical consideration 50 to 100 weevils
are recommended for release in a particular
area. When collection of weevil is not
possible, about one kg of infested salvinia can
be used as the inoculum. Release may
preferably be made whenever tender salvinia
Most of the tree crops of Kerala like
mango, cashew, sapota, apple, pomegranate
and nutmeg are infested with parasitic weeds
from Loranthaceae and Viscaceae families.
The weed infestation affects the growth and
vigour of the tree crops resulting in yield decline
and gradual death of the trees.
• Spraying Ethrel  (ethephone 39% SL)@
25ml/l will result in complete defoliation
of the parasite within 48 hours.
CONTROL OF LORANTHUS
• In case of  regrowth after 3-4 months of
application, padding with 2,4-D (1gm in
20 ml soaked in sponge or oasis) kept in a
few nodal points on the root, after scraping
the bark of the parasite will completely
eliminate the weed.
 Precaution
• Indiscriminate spraying of ethrel  (including
aerial spraying) is not recommended.
• Use of protective clothing, goggles and
hand gloves are recommended.

growth is available. If the plants are very old,
they may be removed mechanically to
promote re-growth and then weevils are to be
released. Almost 100 per cent control of the
weed will be obtained in a span of 12-18
months.
The rate of natural dispersal of the
weevil is rather slow and hence it is
desirable that the infested weed mats are
redistributed at periodic intervals. In canals
used for navigation, the rate of spread of the
weevil is found to be quite adequate.
BIOCONTROL OF PAPAYA MEALY BUG
USING PARASITOID
Papaya mealy bug – Paracoccus
marginatus (Pseudococcidae): Papaya
mealybugs colonise lower side of the papaya
leaves along the veins and later cover the
fruits. Due to the mealy bug infestation, the
younger plants are killed outright.
Biological control: Acerophagus papayae
(Encyrtidae) is a parasitoid imported from
Puerto Rico. The parasitoid successfully
suppressed the mealybug population in Kerala.
The parasitoid is very specific and did not
colonise other species of mealybugs. Release
rate is 25 to 50 numbers per plant. The
parasitoid is parasitizing the second
instar nymphs of mealybugs. It is very active
and have good host searching ability and
suppress the mealybug within 3 to 4 months
depending upon the size of the colony.
Mass production of the parasitoid: The
parasitoid can be successfully mass produced
in the laboratory on papaya mealybug
colonies grown on potato sprouts and shoots.
Two month old potatoes are procured, washed
in water, disinfected using 5% Sodium
hypochlorite solution. Make slight cut on the
potato and treat in Giberelic acid 100 ppm
solution for half an hour. After air drying keep
the potatoes on sand and cover with black cloth
for germination. Good sprouts are produced
within two weeks for mass culturing mealy
bugs. The parasitoids are then released to the
colonies of the mealy bug. A. papyae has very
less pre oviposition period, sex ratio is 1:1,
fecundity 50–60, Total life cycle is completed
in 16–20 days.
ECOFRIENDLY MANAGEMENT OF WATER HYACINTH
(Eichhornia crassipes) IN WATER BODIES
Water hyacinth in water bodies can be
managed by spraying 5 per cent Cashew Nut
Shell liquid (CNSL) emulsion followed by
spraying 40 per cent Wetable Powder
formulation (WP) of Fusarium pallidoroseum
(5 per cent). Spraying may be repeated with
WP 5 per cent alone, after 2 weeks if any new
sprouts develop.
Preparation of 5 per cent CNSL emulsion
To prepare 10 litres of 5 per cent CNSL
emulsion, 500 ml of CNSL and 50 g bar soap
are required. Slice the bar soap and dissolve
in 500 ml of water. Pour 500ml. of CNSL slowly
and stir vigorously to get a good emulsion. Dilute
this one litre solution by adding 9 litres of water
to get 10 litres of 5 per cent CNSL emulsion.
Note:
A minimum of 30 minutes may be given
between the application of CSNL and
Fusarium pallidoroseum.
In moving water bodies fencing with rope
and coconut leaf is recommended.

BIOCONTROL AGENTS AGAINST PLANT PATHOGENS
BIOCONTROL AGENTS AGAINST PLANT PATHOGENS
Arbuscular mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF)
Inoculation with AMF at the time of plant-
ing in the nursery or main field improves the
growth and tolerance of crop against root
pathogens, particularly Phytophthora,
Pythium, Rhizoctonia and root nematodes of
black pepper, cardamom, ginger, turmeric,
cowpea, upland rice and transplanted veg-
etables.
Trichoderma
Biocontrol of soil borne plant pathogens
involves mass introduction of antagonistic
microorganisms in the soil. Trichoderma spp.
is a group of broad-spectrum antagonists
subjected to detailed studies for their potential
as biocontrol agents. They are effective against
the foot rot of pepper (T. viride, T.
longibrachiatum), rhizome rot of cardomom
(T. longibrachiatum, T. virens) and ginger (T.
viride). A mixture of neemcake-cowdung mix-
ture is used as food base for Trichoderma spp.
Dry neem cake and cowdung are to be
powdered and mixed at 1:9 ratio  to get a coarse
texture and then moistened by sprinkling
water. Add the commercial preparation of
Trichoderma spp. (available in polythene
packets) @ 1-2 kg per 100 kg of neemcake
cowdung mixture. After thoroughly mixing,
cover it with a perforated polythene sheet or
ordinary newspaper and keep it in shade for
4-5 days for multiplication. Again mix well and
keep for three more days for further multipli-
cation. This preparation is ready for incorpo-
ration in the soil. Cowdung alone can also be
used as the food base; but, since neem cake is
found to be a better substrate, a mixture of the
two is found better than  using cowdung alone.
If cowdung alone is used, mixing has to be
done at 5 days interval and it will be ready for
use only on the 15th day. This Trichoderma
incorporated neemcake-cowdung mixture can
be used in the potting mixture in nursery beds
and in the field; ie. wherever cowdung is used
as a manure.
For the management of foot rot of Black
pepper, Trichoderma harzianum is recommended
by fortifying 50kg farmyard manure or neem
cake with  1kg of the mother culture and
incubated for 10-15 days before application in
the field (@ 1kg/vine). The mother culture in
liquid formulation can be incorporated with
sterilized coir pith compost @ 1l/20kg and apply
@1kg/vine as above.
Prophylactic application of Trichoderma is
effective for the management of sheath blight
of rice. Trichoderma viride  as - Seed
treatment (10 g/kg seed) + Soil application
(2.5kg ha-1) one week after transplanting +
Foliar spray (10g l-1) after one month is
effective for the management of sheath blight
of rice under upland condition. Seed treatment
can be recommended for submerged rice.
Pseudomonas fluorescens
(Ad hoc recommendation)
Pseudomonas fluorescens are a group of
bacteria very effective against disease incited
by species of Phytophthora, Pythium,
Rhizoctonia, Fusarium, Colletotrichum,
Ralstonia and Xanthomonas in various crop
plants in the nursery as well as in the main
field.
Isolates of Pseudomonas fluorescens have
been developed by the Kerala Agricultural
University for the disease management and
growth promotion of crop plants. This is found
highly effective for the management of foot
rot and fungal pollu of black pepper, sheath
blight and bacterial leaf blight of paddy,
bacterial leaf spot and Phytophthora infesta-
tion in betel vine, bacterial wilt of solanaceous
vegetables, bacterial leaf blight of anthurium

334
and Colletotrichum and Phytophthora infes-
tation in vanilla and rhizome rot of ginger. The
organism significantly improves the growth and
biomass production of crop plants.
Application of Pseudomonas fluorescens
at the rate of 10 g formulation  mixed with
2 kg of well decomposed farmyard manure or
compost and applied in the basin of pepper
vine in the field can also help control foot rot.
Method of application
The time of application and the frequency
of application may vary depending on the crops.
The application may be repeated based on the
intensity of the disease incidence.
The talc-based formulation at 1-2 per cent
level may be used for soil drenching and
spraying. Seedlings/cuttings are treated with
Pseudomonas culture by dipping the root/tip
of cuttings in slurry of Pseudomonas (250 g
in 750 ml for 20 minutes). For seed treatment
in paddy the talc based culture may be added
to the water used for sprouting at the rate of
10 g per kg of seed.
For transplanted crop, root dip treatment at
the time of transplanting, followed by a spray
30 days after transplanting can be recom-
mended. For black pepper, drenching the
nursery plants immediately after planting
followed by one or two sprays depending on
the extent of disease. For managing foot rot of
pepper in the main field, drenching the base of
the vine and spraying the plant with Pseudomo-
nas culture at the rate of  10 g/litre at the
onset of monsoon can be practised. A second
spray may be given, if necessary, during the
mid-monsoon period.
Chemical fertilizers and plant protection
chemicals should not be used along with
biocontrol agents.
SOIL SOLARIZATION
Solarization is a method of hydrothermal
disinfection. This is done by covering moist soil
with transparent polythene sheet and
exposing it to direct sunlight during the
hottest period of the year.
Methods of solarization
a. Nursery bed
The nursery bed for raising seedlings is to
be levelled and pebbles present on the
surface removed before solarization.
Incorporate the required quantity of organic
manure in the soil and irrigate at  the rate of 5
litres per m2. Cover the beds with 100-150
gauge transparent polythene sheets. Seal the
edges of the sheet with soil to keep it in
position in order to maintain the temperature
and moisture inside the polythene mulch.
Adequate care is also to be taken to see that
the sheet is in close contact with the surface
of soil to prevent the formation of air
pockets between the soil and polythene sheet.
Keep the sheet in this way for 20-30 days.
Protect it from stray animals and birds.
After the period of solarization, remove the
sheet and the bed is ready for sowing and
transplanting.
b. Potting mixture
The required type of potting mixture is to
be prepared as per the recommended
practice. Spread this mixture on a levelled
ground to a height of 15-20 cm. Moisten with
335
SOIL SOLARIZATION
water using a rose-can and cover the soil with
polythene sheet and solarize for 20-30 days as
described above. After solarization, the soil can
be used for sowing/planting. This method is
found to be very effective to raise disease free
pepper cuttings.
c. Main field
Solarization can also be effectively used for
the control of soil borne diseases in the main
field. The land used for planting is
initially prepared to a fine tilth and pebbles
removed. Solarization and planting can then be
done as already described.  All the other
agronomic practices are to be followed as per
the package of practices recommendations.
Biopesticides and fertilizers can be
incorporated in soil after removing the
polythene sheet.
Hints for solarization
1. Solarization is to be done in open field
without any shade.
2. Transparent thin polythene sheet
(100 to 150 guage) is to be used, as it is
both cheaper and more effective in
heating due to better radiation transmittance
than thicker sheets.
3. Summer months are more suitable for
solarization.
4. Soil should be kept moist during
solarization to increase the thermal
sensitivity of resting structures of soil-borne
plant pathogens and weeds and to
improve heat conduction.
5. Solarization period may be extended to
one month or more to ensure pathogen
control at deeper layers.
6. Summer showers will not affect solarization.
However, excessive seepage of water into
the bed during solarization should be
avoided.
7. Potting mixture should never be heaped and
solarized, as this will drastically reduce the
efficiency of the technique.
8. Soil should be in good tilth allowing close
contact between the plastic sheet and the soil
to prevent the formation of air pockets, which
will reduce heat conduction.
Benefits of solarization
1. Control of fungal pathogens: Several soil
borne pathogens can be controlled by
solarization. This includes fungi like
Pythium, Phytophthora, Fusarium,
Rhizoctonia etc.
2. Control of nematodes: Population
reduction of nematodes like Meloido-
gyne, Heterodera, Xiphinema, etc. can
be achieved by solarization.
3. Control of weeds: A number of commonly
occurring weeds particularly annuals can
be effectively controlled by solarization.
These include, among monocots, Cynodon
dactylon, Cyperus rotundus and
Digitaria ciliaris and among dicots,
Crotalaria 
muconata, 
Indigofera
hersuita and Noxia sp.
4. Plant growth response: Increased growth
response is observed in plants cultivated in
solarized soil. This is mainly evident as
increase in plant height, number of leaves,
better root formation, increased root
nodulation in legumes and yield.

MUSHROOM CULTIVATION
MUSHROOM CULTIVATION
Species of Pleurotus, commonly known as
oyster mushrooms, grow saprophytically under
natural conditions on trees, dead wood, stumps
and branches. Today several species of
Pleurotus are commercially grown in many
parts of the world. The tropical climate
prevalent in the state is ideal for mushroom
cultivation. Species of Pleurotus and
Volvariella can be successfully cultivated in
the State all round the year on a variety of
agro-wastes like saw dust, vegetable and paper
wastes, oil palm pericarp waste and straw. But
the most suitable substrate is found to be paddy
straw (Table 36).
Variety
Ananthan : Short duration variety of oyster
mushroom. It is an inter-stock hybrid of
Pleurotus petaloides with firm flesh, pure
white colour and is resistant to pest and
diseases. It has good cooking quality as well
as consumer acceptability and can be grown
on wheat, paddy and sorghum straw. On an
average, it takes eight days from spawning to
harvest. Yield potential is 800 g per kg straw.
Bheema : High yielding white milky
mushroom.
Method of cultivation
Polythene bags or tubes of 30 cm x 60 cm
size and 150-200 gauge thickness are taken
for filling the substrate. If the tubes are used,
the free-end is tied with a string. Seven to eight
holes of 0.5-1.0 cm diameter are made all over
the bag for aeration. One kg of well dried, one
year old paddy straw is cut into small bits of
5-8 cm in length and immersed in water for 18
hours. Then the soaked straw is taken out from
water and kept inside the basket for 1-2 hours
to drain away excess water. The soaked straw
is kept under boiling water (100ºC) for 30-40
minutes for surface sterilization or to achieve
pasteurization and then taken out and kept
inside the basket to drain excess water and is
allowed to cool to room temperature. The
pasteurized straw is ready for filling the
bags. Instead of straw bits, small round straw
bundles of 20 cm diameter are also used for
filling the bags. This method is followed to save
time and labour. Now the perforated polythene
bag is filled for about 5 cm height with the above
processed straw and pressed with hand for
making it even. Care should be taken to fill the
bags as compactly as possible for the proper
growth of mycelium. For getting maximum
yield, 2-2.5 per cent (125 g) of spawn is used.
Spawn is taken out from packets and kept inside
a clean container or paper. From this, one
tablespoon full of spawn is sprinkled over the
filled straw around the peripheral region. A
second layer of processed straw is filled and
spawned as above. Repeat the process as
above until the soaked straw is finished. Every
time before spawning, press the straw with
hand for making it compact. If bundles are used
for filling the bags care should be taken to keep
the bundles inside the bag as compact as
possible without leaving any space in between
the bundle. Finally the bag is closed tightly with
twine and beds are kept undisturbed for spawn
running for about 15-20 days inside the rooms,
thatched rodent-proof sheds or in verandas.
The best temperature and humidity for spawn
running ranges from 28-30ºC and 80-85 per
cent respectively. The beds can be arranged
over a platform or in shelves. The spawn
running can be judged from the whitish growth
covering the straw completely. Periodically
observe the beds and discard the conta-
minated ones. After 15 days when the spawn
337
MUSHROOM CULTIVATION
running is complete, remove the polythene bag
by cutting it with blade and keep the bed for
sporocarp formation. The opened beds are kept
in well-ventilated rooms. Relative humidity of
the room should be 80-85 per cent. If
temperature inside the room rises above 30ºC,
the room should be sprinkled with water to lower
the temperature. Diffused light is essential for
normal fruiting. Pinhead formation starts on
20
th day and 2-3 days are required for the
maturation of the fruiting body.
Cropping and yield
Matured and fully opened sporocarps are
harvested by placing the thumb and forefinger
near the base of the fruiting body and twisted in
clockwise direction to get  it detached from the
mycelium. An average yield of 500-700 g can
be harvested from 1 kg of straw. This straw
can be used as enriched cattle feed.
Management of Pests and contaminants
of Oyster mushrooms in Kerala
•
Maintain the pH of the water used to soak
the substrate at 8.0 by adding lime.
•
Cover the holes with cotton or alternatively
put 30 - 40 pin pricks on the polythene cover
of the mushroom bed.
•
Spray 2 per cent garlic in and around the
vicinity of mushroom beds

Cultivation of paddy-straw mushroom
The paddy straw mushroom can be
successfully cultivated in the plains of Kerala
throughout the year where the temperature
ranges between 28-32ºC. The straw beds can
be laid out in sheds, veranda of buildings and
even under shades of trees during summer.
Beds should not be kept under direct
sunlight. Prepare a raised platform of 1 m long
and 0.5 m broad with wooden planks or bricks.
Ten to fifteen kg of well-dried and hand-
threshed straw is required to raise a single
standard bed. For spawning this bed, two bottles
of spawn and about 100 to 150 g of red gram
powder are needed. First the straw is made
into twists of about 5 to 8 m long and 20-25 cm
diameter. The twists are tied into small bundles
and are kept immersed in clean water in tanks
for about 6 to 12 hours. After this, the bundles
are taken out and kept aside for some time to
drain the excess water. The bundles are untied
and the straightened twists are placed length-
wise over the platform in a zigzag fashion. The
twists are placed as close as possible. Keep
another layer over the first layer crosswise.
These two layers form the first layer to be
spawned. Break open the spawn bottles and
carefully divide the spawn into small bits of
2-2.5 cm thick. Place these bits of spawn all
the rate of  along the periphery of the bed,
about 5-8 cm away from the edge and 10 cm
apart. Sprinkle a teaspoon full of coarsely
powdered red gram powder before and after
spawning the first layer. Build the next layer
with one row of twist as done before and
spawn it. Make successive layers until the
straw twists are finished. After placing the last
of twists, press the bed thoroughly from the
top in order to drain excess water. Make the
bed as compact as possible and cover with a
transparent polythene sheet to maintain the
temperature and relative humidity within the
bed. Place another wooden plank over the bed
and keep 4-5 bricks above the plank to get more
compactness. Keep the bed undisturbed for
6-7 days. Slowly remove the sheet and observe
the moisture level of the straw. If the moisture
is excess remove the sheets for half an hour
and then cover it again as before. Small white
round pinheads appear all along the sides of
the bed after 7 days and mature into button
and egg stage on 9
th day. Harvest the mature
sporocarps in egg stage. About 2-3 kg of
mushrooms can be harvested from 10 kg of
straw. Cropping lasts for 2-3 days. After the
harvest, the spent straw can be sun-dried and
used as cattle feed.
Instead of twists, the beds can be laid out
using small bundles of straw each weighing
about one kg. Place four such bundles of straw
side by side over the platform with loose ends
towards the same direction. Over this, place
another four bundles, the loose ends towards
the opposite direction. These eight bundles form
one layer, which is to be spawned as in the

TISSUE CULTURE PROPAGATION OF CROPS
TISSUE CULTURE PROPAGATION OF CROPS
Plant tissue culture is the in vitro culture
of plant cells, tissues and organs under
aseptic condition in defined or semi-defined
media. Tissue culture techniques are increa-
singly being used for the rapid vegetative
propagation of plants. It helps in the mass clonal
propagation of crop plants. It is useful for plants
which do not set seeds or where the viability
of the seeds is poor. Even when conventional
methods of vegetative propagation are
commercially acceptable,tissue culture
propagation can be adopted as it has definite
advantages. It offers an extremely rapid rate
of multiplication. The geometric progression of
tissue culture propagation makes it possible to
produce millions of plants from an initial explant
in a few months. It can speed up the process
of establishing new varieties. Only a limited
quantity of plant tissue is required as the initial
explant. Tissue culture propagation ensures the
availability of plants throughout the year. It
helps in the production of uniform progeny from
cross-pollinated plants. Disease free planting
materials can be made available to the farmers.
Special laboratory facilities and technical skill
are essential for adopting this technique for
mass multiplication of crop plants. Training in
tissue culture is offered by various research
organizations in Kerala.
Procedure
Pipette out the required volume of stock
solutions of chemicals into a one litre glass
beaker. Add components like sucrose and
myo-inositol as solid and allow them to
dissolve. Make up the volume to approximately
950 ml with distilled water. Adjust the pH to
the required value (5.6 to 5.8 for Murashige
and Skoog basal medium) with a few drops of
either alkali or acid, using a pH meter. Add the
required quantity of agar and make up the
volume to 1.0 litre. Pour the solution into a glass
beaker and heat, while stirring, until the agar is
dissolved. Dispense themedium (5 to 15 ml) in
test tubes or flasks and plug with cotton. Plastic
lids or aluminum foil may also be used for the
purpose. Culture jars may be plugged with
plastic lids. Autoclave the vessels containing
culture medium for 15 minutes at 1.06 kg/cm2
pressure (121ºC). While using a pressure
cooker, wait for the continuous flow of pure
steam, put the weight and sterilize for
20 minutes. Explants collected from field
grown plants will have to be disinfected
before inoculating in the culture medium. The
explants are washed in running tap
water first and then in soap solution. They are
then surface sterilized and trimmed
using sterile knives. The commonly used
surface disinfectants are sodium hypochlorite
(0.1 to 2.0 per cent for 15 to 30 minutes) and
mercuric chloride (0.05 to 0.1 per cent for 3 to
20 minutes). The efficiency of the
surface sterilant can be increased, by adding a
few drops of surfactants. After surface
sterilization, the explants should be washed with
sterile distilled water four to five times to
remove the residues. The explants are then
transferred to the sterile culture media in
vessels. This process is called inoculation.
Surface disinfection and inoculation must be
carried out in a laminar airflow chamber. This
equipment can filter the air through a high
efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter of very
small mesh size. This will remove bacteria and
fungal spores. The steady outward flow of
filtered air will ensure a sterile zone in the
equipment, suitable for aseptic manipulations.
The needles, forceps, blades and petri-dishes
used for the manipulation of explants should
be pre-sterilized.
 PROPAGATION OF CROPS AND KEEPING QUALITY OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
340
The tools used in the airflow cabinet may
be kept dipped in 70 per cent ethanol in a
beaker and periodically flamed over a spirit
lamp. After inoculating the explants in suitable
culture media, the cultures are incubated in
rooms under controlled conditions of
temperature (26 + 2ºC), light (200 lux, 18
hours) and humidity (60-80 per cent). Response
of an explant largely depends on the
composition of the culture medium. There are
several basal media, which can be used for
various needs with necessary modifications.
The basal medium is selected to suit the plant
species and the method of in vitro culture. In
general, culture medium consists of salts of
major and minor nutrient elements, vitamins,
amino acids, plant growth substances and a
source of carbon. The established cultures are
sub-cultured to fresh media at intervals of 3 to
5 weeks. The media provided at each
subculture decide the response of the tissue.
Hardening the plantlets to make them adapt to
the outside environment is a critical process,
essentially due to the anatomical and
physiological peculiarities of the plantlets. A
period of humidity acclimatization is necessary
for the newly transferred plantlets to adapt to
the outside environment, during which the
plantlets undergo morphological and
physiological adaptations, enabling them to
develop typical terrestrial plant-water
control mechanism.
Tissue culture techniques for mass
multiplication have been standardized for crops
like banana, pineapple, papaya, black pepper,
cardamom, vanilla, orchids, anthurium, gladiolus
and several medicinal plants. The commercial
adoption of tissue culture clonal propagation is
feasible only when the rate of multiplication is
satisfactory and the cost of plantlets is
acceptable to the farmers. Protocols for the
tissue culture propagation of a number of crops
like red banana, nendran, pineapple, orchid and
anthurium, black pepper, vanilla, medicinal
plants etc. have been developed at the Kerala
Agricultural University and are available for
commercial adoption.
IMPROVING THE KEEPING QUALITY OF
FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
About 30 to 40 per cent of the harvested
fruits and vegetables are estimated to be lost
due to improper harvesting, handling, storage
and transportation in India. If proper care is
taken during these operations, the loss can be
minimized to some extent. Some of the
techniques, which can be adopted, are as
follows.
Harvesting
a. Harvesting must be done at the appropriate
maturity depending up on the marketing
distances and purpose.
b. Harvesting must be done preferably in the
morning hours or late evening to avoid
exposure of the produce to excessive heat,
which will hasten spoilage.
c. Harvesting must be done preferably with
proper harvesting devices suited to the
commodity. For example, mango harvesters
with cutting edges and plastic net can
prevent the damage during harvest and
collection.
d. Avoid impact shock while harvesting fruits
from tall trees; eg. jackfruit, mango etc.
which will cause bruising, leading to
infection.
e. Avoid too loose or too tight packing in gunny
bags while transporting harvested
produces to minimize bruising.
341
Packing
a. Wash the harvested produce in plain
water or in chlorinated water to clean it of
the adhering mud, dirt and residual
pesticides.
b. Remove the infested, rotten and spoiled
friuts.
c. Grading the produce can improve
market acceptability. This can be done at
farmer’s level or at collection points to suit
the standards established by individuals,
industry or government. Grading will also
increase farmer’s bargaining power, as they
are likely to get premium prices for better-
grade products. Similarly buyers can choose
the grades they wish to buy. Possible grading
can be based on colour, shape, size, weight
etc. of the commodity.
During storage
a. Pre-cool the commodity immediately
after harvest to reduce the field heat.
b. Pre-packaging the commodity into unit
packs can reduce the handling losses.
Some of the packaging techniques are
(1) Packing of banana hands at 0.2 to 0.4 per
cent ventilation with polyethylene cover of 150
gauge can  increase the keeping quality upto
10 to 12 days under ambient conditions.
(2) Packing  fresh mushroom (Pleurotus sp.)
in 100 gauge polypropylene pouches without
any ventilation can extend the storage life upto
36 hours at room temperature and up to 7 days
under refrigerated conditions. (3) Fresh tomato
can be stored up to 25 days under ambient
conditions when packed with 35 to 40 per cent
moistened saw dust in the ratio of 1:0.5
(tomato:saw dust). (4) Fresh mature and ripe
sapota can be stored up to 6 days under ambient
conditions when individually wrapped with cling
film.
General storage methods practised to
extend the keeping quality are:
1. By storing the commodity under optimum/
low temperature and humidity.
2. By skin coating using wax emulsion
containing permitted fungicides at
optimum concentrations.
3. By adopting controlled/modified atmos-
pheric storage modifying the oxygen/
carbondioxide ratio within the package.
4. By sub-atmospheric pressure storage.
5. By ventilated storage using ventilated films/
bags.
6. Using evaporative cool chamber
constructed to store temporarily the
harvested produce at the field before
marketing.
LOW COST TECHNOLOGY FOR IRRIGATION AND

of 1mm diameter are drilled on opposite sides
of the pipe, 5 mm away from both ends, at 900
from bottom.  It is centrally attached to a 6
mm micro tube and then to the lateral of the
pipe network through pin connectors.  The
micro tube with sprinkler head unit is held erect
by tying to a riser pipe, fixed near the plant to
be irrigated.
The maximum allowable length of
laterals in this system is 50 m with about
20 sprinkler heads.  An area of 1.0 ha can be
irrigated in two splits by a 0.5 to 1.0 HP
pumping unit with a pressure of 1.0 to 2.0 kg/
cm2. The units are capable of discharging 35
to 45 lph with an area of coverage upto 2.5 m
diameter. Coconut, Arecanut, banana,
vegetables, vanilla, medicinal plants, lawns,
ornamental plants etc. have been found to
respond well to this system of irrigation with
maximum efficiency.
Low cost greenhouse for protected
cultivation
Naturally ventilated greenhouse made of
bamboo/arecanut/GI pipes and covered with
UV stabilized polyethylene sheet are suitable
for growing high value crops like cabbage,
cauliflower, capsicum, tomato and cucumber
round the year. Temperature and humidity build
up inside the green house can be controlled by
natural ventilation through insect proof nets
(40-50 mesh) and by providing the required
height to the structure. The optimum height of
a greenhouse depends on floor area, ambient
temperature, relative humdity, solar radiation
and wind velocity of the locality.
Design of low cost greenhouse
An optimal design of a low cost greenhouse
suitable for homesteads of Kerala  is a gable
shaped structure with a floor area of 75 m2
provided with roof and side ventilation. The
structure should have a ridge height of 4.35 m
and gutter height of 2.5 m. The roof slope
should be around 300, effective side ventilation
not less than 30 per cent and effective roof
ventilation not less than 9 per cent the floor
area of the greenhouse. The temperature inside
the greenhouse increase with increase in floor
area and decreases with increase in height of
the greenhouse. Hence height of greenhouse
has to be increased with increase in floor area.
The structure can be made of arecanut/GI
pipes/bamboo poles. The bamboo/arecanut
poles should be treated with chlorpyriphos (0.2
per cent) to prevent termite attack. The
structure should be covered with UV stabilized
polyethylene sheet (200 micron) with at least
85 per cent light transmissibility. Side ventilators
should be provided on either side of greenhouse
at the floor level and roof ventilators should be
provided at the top level throughout the length
of the greenhouse as shown in figure.
Ventilators should be provided with insect proof
net. Crop yield under the naturally ventilated
greengouse is generally 3.5 times more than
that of open field. Insect and other pest
attack is limited to thrips and mites for which
suitable control measures should be adopted.
Off season production of vegetables is also
possible in greenhouse which fetches a high
market price to the farmer.
Rain shelter cultivation
Rain shelter is a low cost greenhouse.  The
frame of the rain shelter can be made of
bamboo or arecanut palm poles and the roofing
can be done with U. V. stabilized polythene
sheet.  The sides can be kept open to ensure
ample ventilation or can be provided with insect
proof netting or shade net.  Permanent rain
shelter with or without roof ventilation can also
be utilized for growing vegetables during rainy
season.  Frame work can be made by GI pipes
and cladding with UV stabilized film of 200
micron thickness.

drive  from  the prime mover is transferred to
the pulverizer through belt and pulley
arrangement. The pulverizer comprises of
beaters mounted on a horizontal shaft and a
stationary drum.  A sieve is provided at the
bottom of the stationary drum. The beater is
made of a M S flat fitted with semi-circular
sheet, which  is provided with projections in
staggered manner. The projections on the
beater and sieve are too closer, so that the
dried faecal pellet get crushed inside the drum
and expelled through the sieve. The faecal
matter will remain inside the drum until it attains
a size smaller than the sieve size. The
powdered matter will be forced out through
the outlet chute. An outlet chute is provided at
the bottom of the sieve so that powdered faecal
matter is obtained without any loss. The
capacity of the machine is around 45 kg per
hour.

900 ml
Bar soap –
50 g
Water
–
20  litre
Method of preparation
Slice 50 g bar soap into fine flakes and dissolve in 450 ml of boiling water. Cool it and then
add to 900 ml kerosene under violent agitation till the oil is fully emulsified. Dilute this stock
solution by adding 15-20 litres of water for spraying. It is effective against many sucking in-
sects.
TOBACCO  DECOCTION
Materials required
Tobacco waste
– 100 g
Bar soap
– 24 g
Water
– 6  litre
Method of preparation
Soak 100 g of tobacco waste in 900 ml of water for 24 hours. Then squeeze the tobacco
waste and remove all debris by filtering the extract through a muslin cloth or a strainer. Slice
24 g of bar soap into thin flakes and dissolve in 100 ml of water in another vessel. Pour the soap
solution into the tobacco decoction under violent agitation. Dilute this stock solution by adding
6 litres of water. This can be recommeded for managing aphids and other soft bodied insects
infesting vegetable crops.
NEEM SEED KERNEL EXTRACT (NSKE 3%)
Materials required
Neem seed kernel
–
30 g
Water
–
1 litre
Method of preparation
Grind neem seed kernel into coarse powder and put it in a small muslin cloth bag. Keep it
immersed in 1 litre of water in a vessel for 12 hours. Thereafter, squeeze the cloth bag by
dipping in water repeatedly till the water coming out from the cloth bag becomes clear. Squeeze
the cloth bag thoroughly and then remove it. Now the 3% NSKE is ready for spraying.
NEEM OIL – GARLIC EMULSION (2%)
Materials required
Neem oil
– 200 ml
Bar soap
– 50 g
Garlic
– 200 g
Water
– 9 litre
Method of preparation
Slice 50 g bar soap into thin flakes and dissolve in 500 ml of hot water by agitation. Pour
the soap solution to 200 ml of neem oil slowly and stir rigorously. Grind 200 g of garlic by adding
300 ml of water. Filter the garlic extract through a muslin cloth and then add to the prepared
neem oil soap emulsion. Dilute this one litre stock solution by adding 9 litre of water to get
10 litres of 2% neem oil – garlic emulsion.

Appendix  8
PREPARATION OF COMMON FUNGICIDES
Bordeaux mixture (1%)
Dissolve 1 kg of powdered copper sulphate crystals in 50 litres of water. In another 50
litres of water, prepare milk of lime with 1 kg of quick lime. Pour the copper sulphate solution
into the milk of lime slowly stirring the mixture all the while. Test the mixture before use for the
presence of free copper, which is harmful to the plants, by dipping a polished knife in it. If the
blade shows a reddish colour due to the deposits of copper, add more lime till the blade is not
stained on dipping. Always use wooden, earthen or copper vessels for the preparation of
Bordeaux mixture.
In order to confer sticking quality to Bordeaux mixture, rosin washing soda mixture, may
be added. The addition of the sticker is particularly recommended for spraying
conducted during rainy season. For preparing the mixture, 10 litres of water out of 100 litres
required for preparing Bordeaux mixture may be kept apart. Boil 10 litres of water,
preferably in an earthen pot and add 500 g of good quality washing soda (sodium carbonate).
Boil again until the solution becomes slightly dark in colour. Add 1 kg of powdered rosin (arpoos)
in the boiling washing soda solution. Reduce the flame for avoiding frothing,
foaming and spilling over. Boil the solution for 5-10 minutes till black bubbles appear. Cool the
solution until the temperature reaches below 45ºC. The cooled mixture (10 litres) is then added
slowly to the prepared Bordeaux mixture (90 litres) under vigorous stirring.
Bordeaux paste
Dissolve 100 g of copper sulphate and 100 g of quick lime each in 500 ml of water sepa-
rately. Mix together to make one litre of the paste.
Cheshunt compound
Weigh 60 g copper sulphate and 330 g of ammonium carbonate. These two are well
powdered and thoroughly mixed. The dry mixture is stored in an airtight glass container for 24
hours before use. About 25 g of this mixture is dissolved in a little hot water and solution is made
up to 8 litres with cold water and used for soil drenching.
APPENDIX 8

Appendix  9
FUMIGANTS AND ITS USE
(For restricted use only)
Aluminium phosphide
Aluminium phosphide can be used for fumigating rat burrows and for control of pests
infesting stored grains. This is available as ‘Celphos’ or as ‘Aluminium Phosphide’ tablets (3g)
or pellets. For rat control, locate the burrows which contain live rats. For this, seal all burrow
openings with mud in evenings and examine the closed burrows next day. If the mud seal is
opened, such burrows are marked as live ones. In such live burrows, introduce
aluminium phosphide tablets @ 1-2 per burrow and seal off the openings immediately.
For fumigating grains and grain products under cover, use aluminium phosphide
@ 1-2 tablets per tonne of grains, giving an exposure period of 5 days followed by aeration for
a day. For room fumigation, use 5-7 tablets for every 28 cubic metre storage space.
This has to be used under strict supervision of the approved pest control operators.

PESTICIDE GUIDE
The pesticides may be applied according to the severity of infestation of the pest/ infection
of the disease in a need-based manner. Whenever the government bans a chemical,
recommendation for its use automatically stands cancelled. Central Insecticide Board and
Registration Committee, Government of India has published the  list of pesticide formulations
banned in India in its official website (http://cibrc.gov.in). This list is periodically updated by
CIB & RC which will stand applicable to the KAU recommendations, as and when modified.

AD HOC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT OF
SECONDARY AND MICRO NUTRIENTS
A. CROP-WISE RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Rice
Preventive strategies for Zn management
•
Presoak seeds in a 2% ZnSO4 suspension in water (20 g ZnSO4 per litre). 1kg seed to be
presoaked in 1 litre  of  ZnSO4 suspension for 24 hours, drain and keep for sprouting.
•
Fertilizer management: Apply sufficient quantity of organic manure. Incorporate 20 kg
Zn sulfate per ha in the soil before seeding or transplanting.
Treatment of Zn deficiency
If Zn deficiency symptoms are observed in the field, apply 20 kg ZnSO4
.7 H2O per ha.
Foliar spray of 0.5% ZnSO4 solution, (1kg ZnSO4 + ½ kg lime to avoid phytotoxicity in 200
L water ha-1  ie. 5 g ZnSO4 + 2.5 g lime per litre of water) for emergency treatment of Zn
deficiency in growing plants. Apply at tillering (25–30 DAT) and give two or three repeat
applications at intervals of 10–14 days.
Application of magnesium as basal dose @ 20 kg MgO/ha is effective in giving significant
increase in grain and straw yield of rice in magnesium deficient soils.
2. Coconut
Magnesium sulphate @ 0.5-1.0 kg/palm/year is recommended for root (wilt) affected
area.
For sandy and sandy loams of Onattukara and similar situations and also for hybrid palms
grown in root (wilt) affected areas, apply 500 g MgSO4/palm/year.
Apply lime or dolomite during April-May, magnesium sulphate during August- September
and organic matter during May – June. For an adult palm 1 kg dolomite or 1 kg lime + 0.5 kg
MgSO4 is required per annum.
3. Arecanut
Magnesium sulphate @ 60 g, borax and zinc sulphate @ 20 g per palm/year can be
recommended for yellowing affected palms.

APPENDIX 14
B. SOIL BASED RECOMMENDATIONS:
In cases where crop-specific recommendations are not available, the following guidelines
can be used for recommending secondary and micro nutrients.
Secondary Nutrients (Ca, Mg, S)
Calcium deficiency can be anticipated in extremely acidic, highly leached tropical soils. If
the exchangeable Ca level is less than 300 mg kg-1, soils are classified as deficient. Lime
application at rates given below is recommended.
Magnesium deficiency can also be observed under extremely acidic soil environment. If
the exchangeable Mg level is less than 120 mg kg-1, soils are classified as deficient. Application
of   MgSO4 @ 80 kg ha-1 is recommended.
Highly leached tropical soils may develop S deficiency. When available sulphur levels in
soil are less than 5 mg kg-1, symptoms may appear. Application of sulphur / sulphur containing
fertilizers to give 25kg S per hectare is recommended.
Micro nutrients (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn and B)
Kerala soils in general have high levels of iron and manganese. Toxic soluble levels of
these elements can be managed by liming. Deficiency situation may arise in sandy soils with
neutral/alkaline reaction.   When the available Fe is less than 5 mg kg-1 the soil is considered as
deficient. Application of FeSO4 @ 15 kg ha-1 is recommended. Available Mn level less than
1 mg kg-1 soil condition is rated as deficient. Foliar application of 0.5% MnSO4 is recommended.
Copper deficiency is observed in 31% of soils in Kerala. Available Cu level below
0.12 mg kg-1 in neutral/alkaline soils and below 1 mg kg-1 in acid soils is rated as deficient.
Application of CuSO4.5H2O @ 2 kg ha-1, seedling dip in 1% copper sulphate solution or soaking
of seeds in 0.25% copper sulphate solution for rice is recommended.
Deficiency of Zn is observed in about 34% soils in Kerala. Available Zn less than
0.6 mg kg-1 in neutral/alkaline soils and  1 mg kg-1  in acid soils is rated as deficient condition.
Application of ZnSO4.7H2O @ 20 kg ZnSO4 ha-1 is recommended.  Foliar application of
3 kg ZnSO4 dissolved in 187 litres of water per hectare, 20-25 days after planting is recommended
for rice.

Deficiency of B is observed in highly leached soils. Available B levels less than 0.5 mg kg-1
in soil can be rated as deficient.  Deformation of young leaves, drying/withering of growing
points, failure in splitting of leaflets in coconut, chocking etc. are some of the symptoms.
Application of 10 kg Borax ha-1or 0.5% solution of Borax as foliar spray is recommended.
Where ever crop specific ad hoc recommendations are not available, general
recommendations as indicated in the table attached can be adopted.
These ad hoc recommendations can be used to combat problems of deficiency/excess of
secondary/micro nutrients until further refinements and modifications are made.

The laterite and associated soils which constitute more than 70% of cultivated area in
Kerala have shown low or medium status in terms of available micronutrients.  More than 90%
of the soils of Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam districts have shown deficiency of sulphur.
Thrissur and Palakkad soils have also indicated deficiency in 80% cases.  All soils of Kerala
except black soils of Palakkad districts showed varying degrees of deficiency of available Mg.
Kuttanad soils have shown deficiency of zinc, copper, calcium and magnesium.
