Abstract 
 
Kerala is one of the most biodiverse states in the Indian union. The state has put in place an 
elaborate network of policies and institutions to maintain and indeed promote agrobiodiversity in 
the state. The present paper undertakes a detailed review of these by evaluating the policies and 
laws that impact on agrobiodiversity either positively or negatively. It further considers the role of 
public research institutes that generate the requisite knowledge for maintaining biodiversity and the 
cases of a number of local self-governments which have been successful in promoting 
agrobiodiversity. The public research institutes and nongovernmental organizations have played an 
important role in not just generating newer plant varieties and but also play a very important role 
in conserving existing varieties.  Based on the analysis, the study identifies a number of 
researchable issues that may be taken up in future, which will essentially contribute to the 
management of and mainstreaming of agrobiodiversity in the state. The ensuing analysis shows that 
while the state has a number of exemplary policies, laws and practices, its success at the level of 
local self-governments depends crucially on whether agrobiodiversity is tied to the livelihood 
strategies of ordinary people. Further, it also depends on the presence of certain key mentors or 
charismatic leaders within the local self-governments who can make a crucial difference. Merely 
relying on institutional forms such as Biodiversity Management Committees and People’s 
Biodiversity Registers are unlikely to produce the desired results.

Introduction 
Agrobiodiversity reflects the extent of diverse flora and fauna and also genetic diversity in the 
agricultural landscapes and waterscapesof a local community. Pascual et al. (2011: 191) use 
different sources to provide a more formal definition as follows: 
 
‗Agrobiodiversity can be understood as the diversity within and among species found in 
an agro-ecosystem that contribute to food and agriculture, including planned 
(domesticated) biodiversity (i.e., the diversity of crops and livestock genetic resources), 
as well as all other plant and animal genetic resources (i.e. crop wild relatives)’. 
 
In general, a higher level of diversity could be useful on three counts. There are three kinds of 
values of agrobiodiversity. First is the use-value – some of the diverse variety of flora, fauna and 
genes could be directly useful for people (including cultivators). For example, there could 
different plants and animals that cultivators sustain as a source of subsistence or income. The 
agro-diversity might have served the function of a portfolio diversification to address risks in 
less developed societies which do not have formal institutions for insurance or risk minimisation 
(Kontoleon et al., 2009).  In addition, there could be specific uses too. For example, there could 
be some plants in farms that may have a medicinal use for human beings or animals; there could 
be some others which can be used as organic or natural pesticides, and so on. All these are part 
of use-values. Second is the option value. Though some of the varieties are not known to be 
useful with the current information, some of these may turn out to be useful based on future 
knowledge. Hence there is a value in protecting it currently, even if these are not useful based on 
the current knowledge. The use of the genes in traditional or wild varieties of grains for 
enhancing the pest resistance of hybrid ones is an example in this regard.  Third, there are also 
what can be called non-use values. Certain varieties though may not be useful currently or in 
future due to the availability of substitutes, may have certain heritage value. We may want our 
future generations to have a glimpse or exposure to such entities or practices which require 
these. 
 
However, there is a need for a collective or state action for the protection of agrobiodiversity. 
Individuals (including the owners of land) may not have adequate incentives to protect agro-
biodiversity. There could be a shift in agricultural production towards less diverse (sometime 
monocrop) systems. In certain cases, the productivity (in terms of the market value) of mono-
crop (or less diverse) system could be higher especially when some of the useful attributes of a 
diverse crop system may not have an appropriate market. Or the absence or thinness of market 
for certain products may aggravate the situation. For example, the absence of a market for hay 
encourages farmers to use shorter varieties of paddy or wheat. The economic attractiveness of 
less-diverse versus more-diverse farming systems depends on agro-ecological and market 
conditions. 
 
Though there are an option and non-use values, each farmer may not internalise these in his/her 
decision on the use of agrobiodiversity. This too, can create a situation where the agro-
biodiversity through the aggregation of private choices may not be adequate to meet the overall 
social requirement in this regard. Or there could be a mismatch between the private conservation 
costs and wider social benefits or the latter cannot be captured by private conservationists 
(Bellon, 2004). In other words, the conservation of agro-biodiversity has positive externalities, 
and the full benefits of these cannot be captured without state and/or collective action (Friis-
Hansen, 1999). All these are part of the `market failure‘. However, there can be government 
failures too. Some of the policies and programs of the government, instead of protecting agro-
 
 7 
 
 
 
biodiversity, may lead to its decline unintentionally. This could be due to the non-consideration 
of the impact of these policies and programs on agro-biodiversity. Subsidies provided as part of 
government schemes for the promotion of agriculture can distort private incentives to protect 
agro-biodiversity (Perrings, 2001). The breeding programs of the research organisations may 
favour the establishment of less-diverse farming systems (Gruere et al., 2009). For all these 
reasons; there is a need for informed collective and state actions for the protection of agro-
biodiversity. Such a collective action can be at different levels and also facilitated by 
governmental and non-governmental organisations and concerned individuals.  
 
There has been an increase in the awareness of the need to protect agro-biodiversity globally and 
also within countries like India. This has encouraged the national and state governments to take 
different steps for this purpose. However, the effectiveness of these steps depends on a number 
of contextual factors. There are studies which assess the effectiveness of such policies and 
programs in different contexts (for example, Nagarajan et al., 2007; Smale et al., 2008). This 
report assesses the effectiveness of the institutions (laws), programmes, and organisations to 
conserve agrobiodiversity in the Indian state of Kerala. 
 
According to FAO6, experience and research have shown that agrobiodiversity can:  
Increase productivity, food security, and economic returns 
Reduce the pressure of agriculture on fragile areas, forests and endangered species 
Make farming systems more stable, robust, and sustainable 
Contribute to sound pest and disease management 
Conserve soil and increase natural soil fertility and health 
Contribute to sustainable intensification 
Diversify products and income opportunities 
 Reduce or spread risks to individuals and nations 
 Help maximize effective use of resources and the environment 
 Reduce dependency on external inputs 
 Improve human nutrition and provide sources of medicines and vitamins, and 
 Conserve ecosystem structure and stability of species diversity. 
Kerala is one of the most biodiverse states in the country. It is home to several kinds of flora and 
fauna and is situated in one of the 36-biodiversity hotspots, in the world, namely the Western 
Ghats.The people in the State grow 142 crop plants belonging to 104 genera and 43 families 
(Nayar, 2011).  
Kerala is implementing the central Biological Diversity (BD) Act, 2002 and its Rules 2004, 
through state-level BD Rules, 2008. There is a State Biodiversity Board (SBB), and the SBB has 
been establishing Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) in all the Local Self 
Government (LSGs) beginning with the year 2008.  By 2015, it managed to form BMCs in all its 
LSG Units. A report of the working group on biodiversity set up by the KeralaState Planning 
Board has recommended a comprehensive Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan with funding 
for the 13th Five Year Plan (Kerala State Planning Board, 2017). The report advocates a 
participatory management system for the protection of fragile ecosystems such as hills and 
mountains, shola forests, laterite hills, mangroves, sacred groves and riparian habitats, and eco-
restoration of degraded areas like abandoned quarries and ponds. The committee has

recommended mobile apps and crowd sourcing for ecosystem mapping. Local bodies have also 
been charged with the management of invasive species.Further, the committee has recommended 
the preparation of a city biodiversity index for Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, and Kozhikode, 
afforestation of public land in urban areas, eco-restoration of water bodiesand establishment of 
biodiversity parks. All these go on the way towards mainstreaming biodiversity in general at the 
state. Regarding agrobiodiversity, the working group recommended 14 suggestions 7 . These 
range from development of village level seed bank and a seed management committee, 
maintaining  agrobiodiversity inventory at LSG level through PBR, maintenance of databases 
related to Traditional Knowledge, promotion of studies on diversity of natural pollinators and 
predators in the agroecosystem, more attention on the underutilized species as tubers, green leafy 
vegetables, revitalization of organic farming by employing the provisions of Participatory 
Guarantee Scheme (PGS), conservation of local varieties, encouraging boundary bund planting 
in paddy fields, rubber and coconut plantations etc. The Planning Board is in the process of 
implementing these suggestions.  
 
The megafloods in several parts of Kerala in August 2018 seemed to have seriously affected the 
biodiversity of the state. The post-flood biodiversity impact study conducted by KSBB (Kerala 
State Biodiversity Board, 2018)has drawn up a three-pronged strategy to address the impact of 
the floods on the ecology and biodiversity of the State. The rapid assessment is to be followed by 
a chain study to understand how the disaster has affected various ecosystems. The third part of 
the strategy will focus on developing a long-term action plan for ecological restoration. Chapter 
4 of the study documents the district-wise impact of mega floods and landslides on 
agrobiodiversity. The crop worst affected was paddy across 12 of the 14 districts.  Overall in 
both India and Kerala, the share of agriculture in the nation and state‘s economy has been 
declining.   
 
Objectives,  methodology and data sources 
The primary purpose of the study is to understand the policies and that institutions that Kerala 
state and India has put in place to successfully manage and conserve agrobiodiversity in the 
state. It also aims at identifying policy area which needs further careful attention and research. 
The study employs a mix of primary and secondary source material. Primary sources include a 
detailed survey of major public research institutions in the state which generate the formalised 
knowledge for maintaining agrobiodiversity . It has also covered some of the leading NGOs in 
the field. Further, we have surveyed some of the model BMCs in the state. Secondary source 
materials include a critical analysis of major policy documents dealing with agrobiodiversityboth 
in a direct and indirect manner.  
 
Organisation of the study  
The paper is structured into six sections. Section 1 discusses the main institutional mechanism 
that is available for maintaining biodiversity in general and agrobiodiversity in particular at the 
level. This is basically the Biodiversity Management Committees and the People‘s Biodiversity 
Registers (PBRs). Section 2 evaluates the various laws policies that favour or hinder 
agrobiodiversity in the state. These range from the policy on biodiversity itself to the one on 
environment and the agricultural policy of the state to laws regarding Intellectual Property 
Rights (IPRs) in general. Section 3 maps out the range of pubic or government research institutes 
which generate the formalised knowledge and technology for maintaining biodiversity. Section 
4, will analyse the cases of four specific local self-governments all of whom are acknowledged 
by either the State Biodiversity Board or the National Biodiversity Authority, formally, as

successful models from the point of view of  managing and maintaining agrobiodiversity. An 
understanding of the specific strategies employed by these units will be helpful for other 
panchayats in their quest towards management of their agrobiodiversity. Section 5 identifies a 
number of potential areas for further research. Finally, Section 6 concludes the study.  
 
1.Main institutional mechanism for managing agrobiodiversity- 
Biodiversity Management Committees and People’s Biodiversity Registers 
 
One of the most important components of the  state‘s biodiversity strategy is the preparation of 
People‘s Biodiversity Registers (PBRs). Such local-level registers of information about varieties 
areseen as an instrument to protect agrobiodiversity globally (Smale et al., 2004). Although in 
Kerala tribal communities have their own institutional arrangements for managing 
agrobiodiversity (Padmanabhan, M, 2011).  Her study documented collective efforts to halt 
genetic erosion in the state by looking at four case studies on institutional innovations in 
agrobiodiversity management and analyzing their performance from the perspective of gender 
equity. Negotiation over gendered rules is at the centre of this analysis. However, her study was 
conducted during the mid-2000s when BMCs and PBRs were yet to take shape.   
 
PBRs document local community knowledge of status, uses, history, ongoing changes and forces 
driving changes in biodiversity resources, gainers and losers in these processes and people's 
perceptions of how these resources should be managed. A number of PBRs have been prepared 
in different parts of India beginning 1995 through initiatives of NGOs and educational 
institutions working with local communities and village councils. These attempts have been 
motivated by a desire to promote decentralised systems of management of natural resources and 
to create the basis for equitable sharing of benefits of commercial utilisation of local 
communityknowledge of uses of biodiversity. Kerala has one of the best records with respect to 
preparation of PBRs as about 85 per cent of the BMCs have prepared PBRs. See Table 1. 
 
According to the Kerala State Biodiversity Board (KSSB), all the LSGs having BMCs are 
required to prepare the PBRs. As per G.O.(Rt.) 2945/2013/LSGD dated 30.11.2013, the State 
Government has accorded sanction to incur an expenditure of Rs.1.25 lakhs for grama 
panchayats, Rs. 2.5 lakhs for municipalities and Rs.5 lakhs for corporations from the general 
sector development fund of the annual plan or own general-purpose fund for PBR preparation. It 
is mandatory, and all LSGs having BMCs are required to utilise this fund and complete the PBR 
preparation before 31.3.2017. 
Nevertheless, according to the KSSB (as on July 11, 2019)60 local self-governments are yet to 
prepare PBRs. The maximum numbers of panchayats not having prepared PBRs so far are in the 
districts of Palghat with 25 and Malappuram with 14, followed with Trichur 9, Kannur 9, 
Kozhikode, Kottayam and Trivandrum with 1 each.All the other 7 districts have all their local 
self-governments preparing their respective PBRs. This means that Kerala now (July 11, 2019)  
has the highest PBR rate at 94.19 per cent.  
 
The BD Act stipulates that ―the main function of the BMC is to prepare People's Biodiversity 
Register in consultation with local people. The PBR shall contain comprehensive information on 
availability and knowledge of local biological resources, their medicinal or any other use or any 
other traditional knowledge associated with them.‖ Although Kerala‘s LSGs have a good record 
in forming BMCs and preparing PBRs, it remains to be seen if the PBRs are properly framed and 
the data contained inPBRs are subjected to an annual review to see if the biodiversity that exists 
in an LSG is maintained.

It is for this reason, we have taken the case of Kerala for an in-depth examination of the role of 
government with respect to the promotion and maintenance of agrobiodiversity in the country.  
In this study, we are primarily concerned with evaluating the policies favouring agrobiodiversity 
in Kerala and then making an objective assessment of the degree to which Kerala is biodiverse in 
terms of its agriculture.  
 
 11 
 
 
 
 
2. Evaluation of policies and laws that have an impact on agrobiodiversity 
The state has put in place an elaborate network of rules, policies and laws impacting on the 
management of agrobiodiversity. We have divided them into three groups depending on whether 
they impact on agrobiodiversity in a direct or indirect manner and whether they contribute or 
affect knowledge generation in these are. First, we list them, and subsequently, we evaluate their 
effectiveness or not in maintaining agrobiodiversity in the state.   
 
a. Those dealing directly with agrobiodiversity:  
• 
Kerala State Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plan which has several action 
points related to conservation of Agrobiodiversity 
• 
Kerala Conservation of Paddy land and wetland Act 2008 and Amendments 
2018- which had a major impact on paddy land conversion and loss of aquatic 
biodiversity 
• 
Kerala Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Act 2010 which has a direct bearing 
on Agrobiodiversity especially in the view of release of exotic species from 
Aquaculture farms, Nurseries and the leaching of chemicals as antibiotics 
used in farms 
• 
Kerala State Breeding Policy 2008 which does not promote traditional breeds 
and therefore affects conservation in a negative manner 
• 
Environment white paper 2018 which has also pointed out the impact of

2.1 Kerala State Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 
This is the framework policy for promoting agrobiodiversity in the state. There are three specific 
strategies that deal with agrobiodiversity management. See Table 2.

We see that the three strategies deal with only one of the ten targets that are envisaged. In fact 
our discussions with experts reveal that of the three strategies only no. 20 seems to have been 
implemented. Of course, the PBRs can act as a database provided they are digitised and is 
available online. Since GMOs have not been authorised to be released in any of the agricultural 
crops excepting cotton which incidentally is not cultivated in Kerala8, no: 21 is yet to be relevant 
for Kerala.  
2.2The Kerala State EnvironmentPolicy, 2009 
The environment policy has many provisions to maintain biodiversity ingeneral and 
agrobiodiversity in particular.Section 11 has 17 suchprovisions. The most important of these is 
the formation,collection and record of local agrobiodiversity data in People‘s Biodiversity 
Registers (PBR) at the panchayat level and the discouraging of monocultures in cropping?. 
 
According to the data from the Biodiversity Board, only 7 districts out of 14 have completed the 
formation of PBRs in all the Panchayats within a district.   
 
Further, the following comments could also be made: 
 Though there are a number of strategies and action plans envisaged inKerala State 
Environment Policy and also by the KSBB, the details on financial allocations for these 
actions and how theseare being implemented are not clear. Hence, some of these 
strategies andaction plans may be remaining as mere wish statements. 
 There is a need to strategize the protection of biodiversity.How? 
 Given the broad climatic characteristics of the state, the same plant species or variety 
may be prevalent in multiple locations. Some ofthese may be useful to individuals and 
households, and hence they mayhave the incentive to conserve it. 
 However, private incentives may not be that high to conserve all kinds ofplants, species 
and genetic diversity (and that is the need for publicintervention in the form of the 
provision of subsidies or regulations). 
 There is a resource-cost in both the provision of subsidies and also regulation. It is not 
clear whether such costs are estimated, and whether provisions are made to allocate 
public resources for this purpose. 
  The attempt seems to be a wishful effort to protect agro-biodiversity in all places 
wherever these are available. This may not be a realistic target. 
  If the enforcement effort of the state is going to be targeted to all such localities, then it 
may get diluted, and there could be land-use changes that may destroy biodiversity in 
many localities. 
 It may be noted that agrobiodiversity prevails mostly in private lands, and the reach of 
the state is limited in such lands compared to forests which are owned by the 
government. Hence it may be desirable to have a prioritization of the agrobiodiversity to 
be protected. 
 
2.3The Organic Farming Policy 
The stated purpose of this State policy is ‗to protect its rich biodiversity and thus sustain various 
livelihoods dependent on this precious resource‘. In that sense, the connection between the 
                                                                 
8Cotton is grown in a small area in Attappadi  in Palghat district.  
 
 13 
 
 
 
protection of agrobiodiversity and organic farming is envisaged before the formulation of this 
policy.  The policy was proposed and initiated by the KSBB.  
 Though the preamble of the policy is written in a severely non-rigorous manner, it has 
certain positive implications for the protection of agrobiodiversity in Kerala.  
 The policy notes the reality that the intensity of inorganic agriculture in Kerala is not that 
high, and hence has the potential to move towards organic farming. Further, the policy 
notes `the positive side of agriculture in Kerala in terms of the already low levels of 
consumption of hazardous chemicals and, therefore, chances of redeeming farmers to 
organic agriculture are quite high‘ (p.5). The fact that farmers in Kerala use less 
pesticides and other chemicals in growing crops make them much more amenable for 
shifting to organic farming than farmers elsewhere.  
 In the policy, a farmer is defined as 'Organic Farmer' `provided he/she adheres to and 
practices the following three essentialities of organic farming: (1) a farmer who practices 
mixed farming including food crops; (2) a farmer who ensures the conservation of soil 
and water; (3) a farmer who conserves the biodiversity of the farmland‘. This has 
interesting implications such as  
o The conventional idea of avoiding chemical fertilizers and pesticides as the core-
focus of organic farming is given less importance here 
o The definition of organic farming itself is connected to the preservation of 
agrobiodiversity.  
 
 The following strategies of organic farming policy can, in principle, help the 
conservation of agro-biodiversity 
o Ensure seed sovereignty of the farmers and the State 
o Strengthen soil and ensure water conservation measures (by following organic 
approaches) 
o Promote a mixed farming approach for livelihood security and ecological 
sustainability 
o Conserve and improve agrobiodiversity and undomesticated biodiversity 
o Ensure availability of quality organic manure to the farmers 
o Develop Model Sustainable Organic Farms in the State 
 
 Model organic farms (to be) developed by the state as part of the organic farming policy 
can be used for the in-situ and live conservation of agro-biodiversity in different agro-
climatic zones of Kerala. 
 
 On the other hand, the organic farming policy in its present form has a number of 
limitations, and these may affect the achievement of the goal of protecting 
agrobiodiversity too.  
 It has not analyzed the economic incentives of the farmers to move towards 
organic farming policy 
 It has not outlined the ways by which the state has to encourage farmers to move 
towards organic farming overriding the economic incentives, if any, to continue 
with non-organic farming.  
 It has not assessed the costs that the government has to bear in facilitating the 
shift towards an organic policy. 
 It has not outlined the administrative mechanisms beyond outlining the nature of a 
state-level committee for the purpose.  
 
 
 14 
 
 
 
 There could be a case where bio-diversity enhancing farming may become economically 
advantageous for certain farmers in Kerala. This is when we consider the opportunity 
cost of family labour, including that is needed for the supervision of farm operations.  
This is so since the conventional (chemical and mono-crop) agriculture may become 
economically unviable due to the increase in the cost of labour or the opportunity cost of 
family labour. Hence a Low External Input and Sustainable Agriculture (LEISA) may 
become the default option for a set of farmers.  
 
 The organic farming policy has not analysed the existing state and central policies in 
agriculture that may work against the shift towards organic farming. These may include 
the subsidies for fertilizers. Some of these policies cannot be changed by the state 
government. Certain policies that prevail at the national level (say subsidy for fertilizers) 
may benefit Kerala too since it has to import food grains from other states which practice 
chemical agriculture. These ambiguities may reduce the effectiveness of an organic 
farming policy within Kerala and hence may work against the shift towards an agro-
biodiversity enhancing agriculture within the state.  
 
  The shift towards an organic farming policy also depends on the consumers or buyers of 
agricultural products. The analysis of this aspect and the strategies required in this 
domain are weak in the policy. It sees farming mostly from the perspective of supply. 
This is problematic when we see that a major part of the consumption of agricultural 
products within Kerala is imported from other states. There may be a possibility of 
developing an interest among Kerala consumers in organic products, but that may not be 
adequate. It may be that a part of the organic production in Kerala should be able to meet 
the needs of national/international markets. (In fact, the integration of Kerala‘s 
agriculture with the national and global markets is much higher compared to that of other 
states, and this has been the situation historically, and not due to the current phase of 
globalization.) There may be a need to use national and global markets to facilitate the 
shift towards organic farming within Kerala. This may be not be facilitated by the 
rhetorical arguments for self-sufficiency and against trade given at the beginning of this 
policy. These too may add to the ambiguities of the policy and reduce its effectiveness in 
enhancing/protecting agro-biodiversity.  
 
In the policy, a farmer is defined as 'Organic Farmer' `provided he/she adheres to and practices 
the following three essentialities of organic farming: (1) a farmer who practices mixed farming 
(namely diverse crops)  including food crops; (2) a farmer who ensures the conservation of soil 
and water; (3) a farmer who conserves the biodiversity of the farmland‘. The conventional idea 
of avoiding chemical fertilizers and pesticides as the core-focus of organic farming is given less 
importance here. The definition of organic farming itself is connected to the preservation of 
agrobiodiversity.  
 
However, the organic farming policy has not analysed the economic incentives of the farmers to 
move towards organic farming policy. It has not outlined the ways by which the state has to 
encourage farmers to move towards organic farming overriding the economic incentives, if any, 
to continue with non-organic farming. It has not assessed the costs that the government has to 
bear in facilitating the shift towards an organic policy. It has not outlined the administrative 
mechanisms beyond outlining the nature of a state-level committee for the purpose.  
 
The organic farming policy has not analysed the existing state and central policies in agriculture 
that may work against the shift towards organic farming. These may include the subsidies for 
 
 15 
 
 
 
fertilizers. Some of these policies cannot be changed by the state government. Certain policies 
that prevail at the national level (for example,for fertilizer subsidy) may benefit Kerala too since 
it has to import food grains from other states, which practice chemical agriculture. These 
ambiguities may reduce the effectiveness of an organic farming policy within Kerala and hence 
may work against the shift towards an agrobiodiversity enhancing agriculture within the state. 
 
The shift towards an organic farming policy also depends on the consumers or buyers of 
agricultural products. The analysis of this aspect and the strategies required in this domain are 
weak in the policy. It sees farming mostly from the perspective of supply. This is problematic 
when we see that a major part of the consumption of agricultural products within Kerala is 
imported from other states. There may be a possibility of developing an interest among Kerala 
consumers in organic products, but that may not be adequate. It may be that a part of the organic 
production in Kerala should be able to meet the needs of national/international markets. (In fact, 
the integration of Kerala‘s agriculture with the national and global markets is much higher 
compared to that of other states, and this has been the situation historically, and not due to the 
current phase of globalization.) There may be a need to use national and global markets to 
facilitate the shift towards organic farming within Kerala. How have India‘s free trade 
agreements (FTAs), such as the ASEAN-India FTA impacted agricultural priorities and 
agrobiodiversity in the state? 
 
This may be not be facilitated by the rhetorical arguments for self-sufficiency and against trade 
given atthe beginning of this policy. These too may add to the ambiguities of the policy and 
reduce its effectiveness in enhancing/protecting agrobiodiversity. Any risk of organic 
monocultures, as against diversity in organic practices. 
 
However, the actual implementation of the organic farming policy underwent considerable 
administrative delays.As experts say, ―though there was huge enthusiasm about the policy at the 
political level, it was languishing at  the office of the Agricultural Production Commissioner‘s 
(APCs) for  nearly two years until it was implemented as an agricultural action plan in 2010.  
The policy was designed in such a fashion that each district principal agriculture officers should 
identify the blocks and each blocks are given target of  area to be cultivated. Thereafter, the 
agriculture officer of the area was given the responsibility to initiate local action plans. Though it 
went fairly well for quite some time the regime change drastically altered the policy direction. 
Ultimately the financial allocations were moved from the district development blocks to 
Kasaragod district in the context of endosulfan calamities 9 . The entire course of this 
development shows the dysfunctional characteristics of the state machinery, because the agency 
that had undertaken the organic farming responsibility in Kasaragod district ended up returning 
the fund because they failed to fulfil the targets. Interestingly, the government seem to be 
interested in entrusting organic farming responsibility to private agencies rather than to state 
agencies, which are comparatively efficient, well-organised and regularly monitored. The 
current regime aims to involve agricultural university in the entire policy implementation. In 
short, the only time period the policy was implemented in the last ten years is merely nineteen 
months‖.10 Expert views reveals the crucial fact that contrary to its flamboyance, such policies 
are  always connected to the vigor and interest of the incumbent as well as successive regimes  
                                                                 
9Kasaragod district in Kerala shot into global attention in the late nineties  due to use of endosulfan—a  highly toxic 
pesticide—in cashew nut plantations. The toxicity of endosulfan and health issues due to its  bioaccumulation came 
under media public and government attention when health issues precipitated in the district.

and it is essential to have a permanent state agency initiate and implement and monitor  the 
policy.  
As far as considering the certified organic farming area in Kerala, an organic farmers‘ directory 
has been prepared by the Farm Information Bureau of department of agriculture and farmers‘ 
welfare, government of Kerala. The data contains the details of farmers with their contact details 
etc. for five districts of the state viz., Wayanad, Kottayam,  Malappuram  Kozhikode, and 
Idukki. See Figure 1. As per this data the area under certified organic farming comes works out 
to only 0.18 per cent of the net sown area.

Although the policy on organic farming has defined an organic farmer, hitherto the state has not 
evolved any specific indicators or Standard Operating Procedures for organic and aquaculture 
farms. These needs to be evolved so that objective definition of an organic farmer and the area 
under organic farming can be computed and its diffusion in state‘s agriculture can easily be 
measured. 
Jaivam, Mahatma Gandhi University(MGU)’s organic farm drive:This drive is for 
transforming one of the 14 districts, namely Kottayam district, into a 100 percent literate district 
in organic farming in cooperation with National Service Scheme, Kerala JaivaKarshakaSamiti, 
academic departments of the university and Kudumbasree units. The main aim of the project is 
to inform each family member of the district about organic farming. As part of this, the trained 
volunteers would visit 4,87,296 households in 71 panchayats and 6 municipalities in the district. 
The volunteers would interact with the 1.97 million people in the district to adopt ethical organic 
practices to enrich the soil and preserve the environment for a healthy generation. It was 
inaugurated on August 29, 2017. The project is implemented through the National Service 
Scheme (NSS) units in its affiliated colleges.However there is practically no data on how far this 
specific project has contributed to managing agrobiodiversity in the state. In any case, data from 
the Farm Information (undated) shows that the total area under certified organic farms in 
Kottayam district is only about 37 hectares- working out to an insignificant percentage of area 
under organic cultivation in the state.

2.4Agricultural Development Policy 
Another policy having a bearing on agrobiodiversity is the Agricultural Development Policy 
2015 of the state. The policy has 46 sub-policies. Although none of these is specificto 
biodiversity despite the fact that one of the much-asserted objectives of the policy is to make 
―Kerala a biodiversity paradise‖. However,the CDSteam has identified 10 sub-policies that have 
the potential to either support agrobiodiversity or have a negative impact on it. Of the 19, 9 have 
a positive impact, and 1 may have a negative impact. 
 
The suggested policies in Agricultural Development Policy, 2015, which may have an impact on 
the protection of agrobiodiversity, are listed in Table 3.

2.4.1 Major limitations of the Agricultural Development Policy 
Though there is an organic farming policy, we do not see that getting reflected in the 
Agricultural Development Policy, 2015. It is mentioned in only one place. (Policy 245: Kerala is 
having a well-defined policy on 'Organic Farming', and on this light, organic pesticides are to be 
made freely available, and the recent technology developed by CTCRI needs an intensified 
production.) The focus of the latter seems to be on the mainstream input-intensive agriculture. 
This shows how different policies can be at cross-purposeswith respect to mainstreaming 
agrobiodiversity.   
Most of the policy statements in Kerala Agricultural Development Policy, 2015, are wish 
statements, without thinking about the costs and mechanisms for their enforcement. 
2.5. Laws on Intellectual Property Rights 
Another policy having a bearing on agrobiodiversity is the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) 
Policy of the state. This policy is formulated in consonance with the provisions of the Indian 
Patents Act and the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. However, the focus is on what it calls 
`traditional knowledge‘. The main purpose of the policy is to create legal property rights on such 
knowledge to avoid `misappropriation‘ by corporate and capitalist enterprises and can lead to the 
creation of a knowledge commons. We need to think theoretically about the potential of such a 
`legal right‘ on traditional knowledge on the conservation of agrobiodiversity. It may be better to 
compare a `with‘ and `without‘ situation here. We may consider a legal right to the farmer useful 
for the protection of agrobiodiversity, if there is an actual or probable under-use of traditional 
knowledge, and a decline in the use of the diverse variety of genetic, plants and animal varieties, 
and hence there is a decline in the effort to conserve/protect these varieties, in the absence of the 
legal right, and if the newly instituted right can reverse the trend. We need to evaluate the 
`Intellectual Property Rights Policy of Kerala‘ with such a perspective. Tables 4 and 5 
summarises the grant of two IPR laws, namelygeographical indications (GIs) granted and Plant 
VarietyProtection (PVP) registered in Kerala since 2005.  
 
Based on this perspective, CDS sees only one clause (No.6) directly contributing to the 
conservation of agrobiodiversity. This is the one which entrusts with the Kerala Traditional 
Knowledge Authority(KTKA) with the responsibility to carry out promotional activities such as 
the formation of `traditional knowledge cooperatives in order to enable such users to access 
larger markets for their practices and products‘. The policy also gives a strong role to the SBB. 
Such access to larger markets may enhance the incentives to use traditional knowledge and 
hence preserve agro-biodiversity (as long as it is required for the use of such knowledge).

It remains to be seen whether GIs and PVP have led to increased cultivation of these crops. This 
is an area where future research is required.  
 
2.6Extent of Agrobiodiversity in Kerala 
It is essential that we have a summary measure to quantify the extent of agro biodiversity and its 
changes over time. Ideally speaking, it should be constructed at the level of the BMC.  But 
detailed data for such quantification at the BMC level is hard to come by, but the KSBB may 
develop it. As a first step, we compute the area of those agricultural crops that allow 
intercropping with other crops. The share of the area under such bio-diverse crops in the total 
cropped area is computed. It shows that about 77per cent of the cropped area in the states is 
under bio-diverse crops in 2016-17,although it has shown some slight reduction in 2016-17 
compared to 2007-08 (Figure 2). This is essentially due to the fact that – Natural Rubber- one of 
the primary commodities and the main mono-crops in the state has increased its share of cropped 
area (Figure 3), although all other monocrops have reduced their area. However, Natural Rubber 
continues to occupy an important position in the cropping pattern of the state (Figure 4).

However considerable gaps exist in our knowledge of genetic diversity of crops. The annual data 
on agricultural area and output brought by the State‘s Department of agriculture does not reveal 
agrobioversity. Hence we recommend that the agricultural statistics may include varietal 
diversity of at least the major agricultural crops to enable better conservation of 
Agrobiodiversity. 
2.7 Some critical issues having a bearing on management of agrobiodiversity 
Here we discuss two specific issues that have a bearing on management of agrobiodiversity in 
Kerala. These are the role of custodian farmers and Access Benefit Sharing. These are discussed

2.7.1 Role of custodian farmers 
Biodiversity international, a CGIAR research Centre defines custodian farmers as ―Custodian 
farmers are defined as ―those farmers (men and women) who actively maintain, adapt and 
disseminate agricultural biodiversity and related knowledge, over time and space, at farm and 
community levels and are recognized by community members for it‖. Given the fact that 
existing gene banks and other ex-situ conservation measures are not sufficient enough to 
conserve agrobiodiversity, it is recommended that custodian farmers should be the main focus of 
agrobiodiversity conservation as they are functioning as a farmer-cultivators as well as farmer-
conserver. So the policy on agrobiodoversity management must include identification, support 
and promotion of custodian farmers.  Examples of custodian farmers include, Chruvayal Raman 
or Ramettan-a Kurichiya tribe farmer by birth, is leading a battle to preserve age-old traditions of 
cultivation that were prevalent among the Adivasis of Wayanad.  N. M. Shaji, who is conserving 
a wide spectrum of tuber crops, including wild tubers, paddy, and vegetables using organic 
cultivation methods, is another notable custodian farmer: he had also won the national Plant 
Genome Saviour Award in 2015. 
2.7.2Access Benefit Sharing 
The Nagoya protocol on Biodiversityemphasizes the access to the genetic resources and its fair 
and equitable benefit sharing of genetic resources. This is known as Access Benefit Sharing 
(ABS). As per Section 7 of Biodiversity Act 2002 and Section 16 of Kerala Biological Diversity 
Rule, 2008, any Indian citizen or body corporate or association or registered organization should 
seek approval of the KSBB for access to collection of biological resources in Kerala for 
commercial utilization. The transition to an ABS regime is a priority area identified by the State 
Planning Board, in its working group report on biodiversity for the 13th Five Year Plan (Kerala 
State Planning Board, 2017). Chapter 9 of the working group report deals with ABS. It proposes 
a statewide scheme for documenting commercially tradablebio resources and industries utilising 
the resources. The report calls for equipping panchayat-level Biodiversity Management 
Committees (BMCs) with negotiating skills to maximise the returns from trade in bioresources 
under the ABS regime. The BMC would be authorised to levy collection fee for accessing 
biological resources for commercial purposes. The levy would be deposited in a local 
biodiversity fund and utilised for conservation activities. According to press reports11, the 
KSBB had identified 2,694 industrial units including Ayurvedic drug companies, tea and coffee 
manufacturers, agro-based units, food and fruit processing centres, leather, cashew, textiles, 
paper, rubber, coir, spices, wood and bamboo-based industries and exporters of these products 
that were liable to pay a part of their sales revenue for access to bioresources and associated 
traditional knowlededge into a fund to be denoted as Local Biodiversity Fund. We could not find 
out whether fund has actually been created and whether the rules for operationalising the fund 
have been created. This is one of the policy instruments for agrobiodiversity management that 
needs immediate attention.  
3.Public ResearchInstitutions(PRIs) that support knowledge creation 
for agrobiodiversity 
 
Kerala has a wide network of public research institutes which have been engaged in the 
generation of formalised knowledge for ensuring agrobiodiversity. These are owned by the 
central and state governments. Further, there are a limited number of NGOs which are diffusing 
knowledge on agrobiodiversity. Of these, 5 PRIs (national and state level) and 2 NGOs which 
are actively engaged in the promotion of agrobiodiversity have been selected. The CDSteam also 
                                                                 
11See Nandakumar T (2017)

selected 2 more PRIs that are active in promotion of biodiversity in general as well. The 
activities and interventions of these institutions in these areas have also been assessed.

3.1Central Tuber Crops Research Institute (CTCRI) 
CTCRI is a national-level institute coming under Indian Council of Agricultural Research 
(ICAR) to undertake basic, strategic and applied research for generating technologies to 
enhance productivity and utilization potential of tuber crops other than potato.  The key areas 
are genetic resource management, crop improvement, sustainable production and utilization of 
tropical tuber crops. It acts as a national repository of scientific information on tuber crops and 
transferring tuber crops technology through consultancy, outreach programmes and linkage 
with developmental agencies. The activities of CTCRI have been executed through five 
divisions i.e., Crop Improvement, Crop Production, Crop Protection, Crop Utilisation and 
Extension and Social Sciences. The collection of germplasm of different tuber crops from 
different parts of the world and conserving it in field gene bank has been carrying out under 
crop improvement division. The development of new varieties of tuber crops with higher yield 
and other attributes suitable for industrial applications as well as for food purpose is another 
important activity of this division. The development of new agro techniques for tropical tuber 
crops in different agro-climatic regions is being monitored under crop production division. The 
development of strategies and products for managing pests and diseases, which are affecting 
tropical tuber crops is being monitored under crop protection division. Crop utilization division 
concentrates its activities on value addition and post-harvest processing of tropical tuber crops. 
Transferring the technologies of CTCRI to its clienteles and introducing farmers‘ supporting 
schemes come under the extension and social sciences division. 
 
Generally, tuber crops are considered asthethird most important food crop. In present global 
scenario of climate change, tuber crops are gaining visibility as Future Smart Crops for climate 
resilience, low input cost and also for being rich in calorie, dietary fibers, minerals, vitamins 
and anti-oxidants (Research Highlights-2017-18, CTCRI). CTCRI is carrying out the 
development of tuber crops to ensure nutritional food and livelihood enhancement for the rural 
people. The Centre organizes awareness training programmes, technical assistance, an 
incubator facility for the production of value-added products from tuber crops to farmers, 
 
 26 
 
 
 
entrepreneurs, etc., The Centre also strives to popularize various kinds of tuber cultivation 
among the farmers. New varieties of tubers of high yield and disease-resistant have been 
developed. 
 
The centre is conserving 15 species of tubers including cassava, sweet potato, yam, taro etc.  
The centre is also maintaining related species like 13 species of Greater yam, Lesser yam, 
Potato yam, 6 species of Taro, 8 species of Elephant yam, 4 species of Chinese potato, 8 species 
of Minor arrowroot, one species of minor wild tubers and one species of Asparagus. A total of 
5570 accessions comprising 1211 cassava, 1124 sweet potato, 1110 yams, 683 edible aroids, 
200 minor tuber crops and 1242 collections from Regional Centre (RC) were maintained and 
conserved in the field gene bank of CTCRI. It is reported that new collections were added to the 
existing germplasm from various sources in sweet potato (20), yams (3), edible aroids (1) and 
minor tuber crops (15).  
The centredeveloped 67 new varieties of various kinds of tubers. It includes 19 Cassava 
varieties, 21 Sweet Potato, 9 Greater yam, 5 White yam, 2 Lesser yam, 8 Edible aroids, 2 
Elephant foot yam, and one Chinese potato varieties. Cassava varieties i.e., SreeAthulya and 
Sree Apoorva with higher yield and high extractable starch have been developed in CTCRI, 
Trivandrum has been registered in ICAR-NBPGR. Sweet potato varieties, i.e., BhuSona,Bhu 
Krishna, Bhu Swami have been developed in RC, ICAR-CTCRI Bhubaneswar has also been 
registered in ICAR-NBPGR. 
CTCRI developed biopesticides from cassava leaves which are popular in the state, namely 
Nanma, Sreya and Menma. It is effective for preventing Pseudostem weevil attack and Rhizome 
weevil attack in banana cultivation. There is immense scope for promoting these biopesticides in 
the state, especially since a lot of farmers are cultivating banana as compared to paddy.  
Organic farming network project is being carried out by the Centre. It is reported that 
standardised organic farming practices for all major tuber crops are being promoted. Mobile app, 
namely ‗Tuber Guru‘ has been developed for getting information related to the tropical tuber 
crops for the public both in English and Malayalam languages. Algorithm for Variety 
Identification Tool (VIT) app to identify varieties of tuber crops based on their morphological 
attributes like colour, shape, leaf, etc., has also been developed. On the front of the promotion of 
agro biodiversity, CTCRI plays a pivotal role in the conservation of tuber crops‘ diversity. 
Previously, the KSBB had proposed a tuber germplasm conservation programme in Onattukara 
panchayat in Alappuzha district. However we could not find any update on this programme.  
3.2 Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (KVASU) 
Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (KVASU) was established in 2010 by the 
Government of Kerala to provide education, research and extension services in the field of 
Veterinary and Animal Sciences. The university occupies 100 acres of land at Pookode in 
Wayanad district, which was allotted from the land belonging to the Pookode Dairy Tribal 
Welfare Project of Government of Kerala. The University comprises of three major areas: 
Veterinary and animal sciences, Dairy Science and Poultry Science. The 8 constituent colleges 
functioning under the university are College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences located at 
Mannuthy and Pookodu,  College of Dairy Science and Technology located at  Mannuthy, 
Pookode, Chettachal, Kolahalamedu, College of Avian Sciences and Management 
Thiruvazhamkunnu, College of Food Technology, Thumburmuzhy, etc. The University has a 
wide network of instructional and research farms spread throughout the state.  
 
 
 27 
 
 
 
Various institutions under the university contribute to research and extension services in the 
fields of veterinary, dairy, poultry, etc. The Directorate of Entrepreneurship with headquarters at 
Pookode, Wayanad focuses on capacity building of farmers, entrepreneurs and extend services 
through outreach programmes, developing model farms, supporting self-help groups in 
improving production and productivity of livestock. The Directorate plays a vital role in 
commercializing new ideas and raising productivity and employment in all sectors, especially 
benefitting the farming community. The College of Dairy Science and Technology, is focussing 
on the value addition of milk, establishment and commissioning of dairy plants throughout the 
state, assuring safe and quality products for the public, designing kits and tests for quality 
analysis of milk and milk products, maintaining active link between the field level farmers and 
scientific community, in-depth knowledge of farm animal practices etc. Centre for Advanced 
Studies in Poultry Science which is located at Mannuthy mainly focuses on academic and 
research on poultry science. It also conducts training programmes for farmers, conserving 
poultry germplasm, selection and breeding of egg production, etc. 
 
Wayanad district is rich in forests and wildlife. The human-wildlife conflict is a serious issue 
while considering agricultural practice in high ranges. Farmers are suffering from attacks of wild 
animals as it damages crops and other consequences. Centre for Wildlife Studies of the 
university is focusing on carrying out research in the areas of forest and biodiversity of the 
Western Ghats region, human-wildlife conflicts etc. To conduct research on climate change 
adaptation and mitigation strategies in the field of Animal Agriculture, a Centre for Animal 
Adaptation to Environment and Climate Change Studies has been established.  
 
3.2.1 Conservation of Indigenous Animals 
Vechur Cow  
Vechur Cattle Conservation Project is running under the KVASU for increasing the reproduction 
and conservation of indigenous cattle. Vechur cattle are indigenous, disease resistant and 
suitable for Kerala's climate. The average height for Vechur cows is three feet only, and the cost 
of feeding and rearing is less compared to the hybrids. Milk production may not be as high as 
hybrids, but the quality of Vechur milk is very high. A large Vechur farm under KVASU 
comprising 120 cows is functioning in Mannuthy by applying scientific reproductive methods. 
Other Vechur farms are functioning in Thiruvazhamkunnu, Thumburmuzhy and Pookode. There 
is a huge demand for Vechur cow from the farmers. KVASU is supplying cattle based on 
priority only, and it is unable to meet the increased demand from farmers. Semen of Vechur 
bulls has been collected and protected as chilled semen through scientific methods for supplying 
to the farmers. It is reported that the regular supply of chilled semen to the already sold cows, 
their progeny and other registered cows are continuing from the project.

The cattle conservation project is also aiming at the conservation of Kasaragode dwarf, which is 
another indigenous variety. Conservation, scientific reproduction methods, and meeting 
demandsoffarmers for Kasaragod dwarf cattle are being encouraged. The project also aims to 
make people aware about the genetic diversity of indigenous cattle and to extend the low-cost 
livestock rearing to the rural areas. 
 
In addition to the role of KVASU, the Vechur Conservation Trust has played an important role 
in conserving the indigenous animals. One of the main difficulties in diffusing indigenous cows 
like the Vechur cow is the dairy policy of the state which lay emphasis on hybridsation of cows 
to improve milk yield.  
 
Pigs, Goats and other Animals 
KVASU is conserving indigenous Angamali pigs and maintaining farms. Centre for Pig 
Production and Research under KVASU is functioning at Mannuthy. A pig breeding farm has 
also been maintaining there. The major objective of the centre is to, conduct research on 
different aspects of pig production, to operate as an instructional farm to students, to function as 
a demonstration unit to farmers, to maintain purebred nuclear stock of animals for the supply of 
quality piglets to farmers. A new crossbred pig, namely ‗Mannuthy White‘ has been developed 
and released on 8thFebruary 2017.  The centre is functioning with the objective to study the 
performance of indigenous pigs and their crosses with Large White Yorkshire for the efficiency 
of feed conversion, production and reproduction. The Centre for Pig Production and Research 
Mannuthy has been providing purebred and crossbred piglets to farmers for starting breeding 
units all over Kerala and many parts of south India. The centre provides training, technical 
advice and support to establish pig farms, etc. to the farmers.   
 
A Goat and Sheep Farm is functioning at Mannuthy. Supply of kids to farmers, technical and 
managerial advice to farmers about goat farming, breeding, etc. have been going on. 
Conservation of indigenous ‗Malabari Goat‘in its native tract, supply of superior breeding bucks 
to the field centres for breeding purpose are in progress under the Goat Improvement Scheme. 
KVASU has identified farmers for indigenous goat rearing and provides all support to them. A 
Rabbit farm is also maintained, with a supply of rabbits, to provide technical advice to the needy 
farmers. 
 
Poultry 
 
 29 
 
 
 
A Poultry farm consisting of 34 varieties is being systematically maintained under the university. 
Varieties of indigenous and other egg fowls which include Gramasree, GramaLekshmi, Athulya, 
Desicross, Giriraja, Australorp, Rhode Island Red, New Hampshire,Thellichery, Aseel, 
Kuttanadu duck, Kadaknath etc., are conserved in the farm. Other poultries including ducks, 
quails, ornamental poultries, etc., are alsoconservedin the farm. Schemes like Aiswarya have 
been introduced to propagate poultry to increase egg production in the state.  
 
Gothra Mission  
Being the largest institute for higher education in Wayanad and the only university of the 
district, KVASU has taken a responsibility to participate in the efforts of the Government of 
Kerala to work for the upliftment of tribal people. A new project, namely ‗Gothra Mission‘ has 
been introduced in this respect. Gothra Mission was formally inaugurated by the Hon. Governor 
of Kerala on 6th April, 2019. Today, tribes lead a marginalized life, far from the freedom they 
once enjoyed in nature, forced to live in restricted spaces under extreme poverty and 
exploitation, having to depend on settlers for subsistence mostly as agricultural labourers. Poor 
education and alcoholism are serious concerns among them.  
 
It is reported that KVASU having 100 acres of land, a large number of students and teaching 
faculty with expertise in all areas associated with animal husbandry and allied areas, including 
courses, training programmes and infrastructure suitable for training tribal youth for alternate 
livelihood activities, are the advantages in tribal welfare work. 
 
Salient features of Gothra Mission 
Presently ninetribal students belonging to the Paniya community who are most vulnerable 
among tribes, are being trained for six months under the KVASU certificate course titled 
‗Multiskill Development Programme in Integrated Resource Management Centred on Livestock 
and Poultry‘. All of the students are dropouts from school; none has completed SSLC, working 
as daily wage labourers. Most of them come from landless families of Narangakandy Tribal 
Colony, Kalpeta. KVASU provides a stipend of Rs. 500.00 per day for 5 days a week during the 
six months course from the Scheduled Tribes Development Department (Integrated Tribal 
Development Project, Kalpeta) for each student. Training in vegetable cultivation, poultry 
farming, rabbit rearing, ornamental fish rearing, aquarium and pond making, poultry keeping, 
beekeeping, mushroom cultivation, animal cage industrial fabrication, orchid and anthurium 
cultivation, dog keeping for breeding, ornamental bird breeding, etc. have been provided. 
Production units of each of these activities have been established in 2 acres of land at the 
university campus. 
 
Display units of ‗I farm‘, is a novel method introduced by KVASU Centre for Wildlife Studies, 
established under the Gothra Mission. These units allow the integrated rearing of poultry, 
vegetables, fish, etc., in human-wildlife conflict areas. It is reported that these units are being 
managed by the tribal students and they are also trained in the manufacture of ―I farm‖ units.  
 
Students are being supported to continue school education under ‗Thulyatha‘ scheme. Now the 
students started earning money already from the sale of chicken eggs, vegetables, etc., at the 
university campus. The tribal students are being organized into a co-operative that will function 
under the continuous guidance of the university, and other tribal people will also be included. 
Produces, value-added products and services of the co-operative will be made available to the 
public through the facilities of the university, including its sales counters.  It is reported that 
landless tribal members can undertake income-generating activities at the unused parts of the 
university campus. Members who own land can undertake income-generating activities under 
 
 30 
 
 
 
the continuous guidance of the university. Ninety-five percent of the income from sales will be 
divided among the members of the co-operative that participate in the activities, 5% of income 
will be transferred to university for the sustainability of the project.  
 
A start-up company is being registered with the Technology Business Incubation Centre (TBIC) 
of the university by a fraternity of the alumni of various graduate and postgraduate courses of the 
university under the leadership of alumni of the Master of Science (Wildlife Studies), course 
being run under the KVASU Centre for Wildlife Studies. The company will be responsible for 
publicizing and sales of the produce, value-added products and services of the co-operative, 
including the ―I farm‖ units, using online and other marketing methods at a national and 
international level, this will allow more demand and sustainability for the income-generating 
activities of the co-operatives. 
 
Conducting research for further development, extension activities by making a link between 
scientists and farmers, providing training to the farmers, creating model farms, knowledge 
transfer for scientific livestock rearing etc., have been carried  out by the various institutions in 
the fields of veterinary, dairy, poultry under the university. The university strives to extend its 
research outcomes to the farmers by providing training, scientific methods for livestock rearing, 
conserving traditional varieties of animals and poultry, etc.  The brand name of the university is 
a crucial factor among the farmers and people, and it can be utilised to disseminate its activities. 
The Gothra Mission initiative of KVASU is a unique attempt to uplift the tribes by providing 
livelihood opportunities through agricultural and livestock practices. This is contributing to the 
promotion of agrobiodiversity as well.  
 
3.3 Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) 
Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) was established in 1971 with the aim of excellence in 
agricultural education, research and extension for sustainable agricultural development and 
livelihood security of the farming community. The headquarters of KAU is located at Mannuthy, 
Thrissur. The University has seven colleges, sixRegional Agricultural Research Stations 
(RARS), other Research Stations and Research and Extension Units. In addition, an Academy on 
Climate Change Adaptation and an Institute of Agricultural Technology are also functioning in 
KAU.KAU is providing quality education in agriculture, horticulture, co-operation, forestry, 
agricultural engineering, home science and other allied disciplines through its various 
institutions. KAU is also rendering the support to increase the productivity of crops in the 
agricultural sector by means of research initiatives.  
The state has been divided into six agro-ecological zones by KAU to carry out research and 
extension of various crops based on location specificity. The zones are northern, high range, 
central, special zone for problem areas, Onattukara and southern zone.Two research stations are 
functioning in the Northern Zone for coconut and pepper. Regional Agricultural Research 
Station (RARS), Pilicode maintains a unique collection of coconut germplasm consisting of 35 
exotic and 40 indigenous types and the research on hybridisation for getting high yield are being 
carried out. Pepper Research Station, Panniyur has released five varieties of pepper, viz. 
Panniyur-1, Panniyur-2, Panniyur-3, Panniyur-4 and Panniyur-5 through their research and all 
are well received by the farmers. Two research stations are functioning to provide research 
support for agriculture in the High Range zone (Wayanad and Idukki districts and 
Nelliyampathy area of Palakkad district). RARS, Ambalavayal(Wayanadu) concentrates on rice, 
spices and vegetables and serves as a major hub for the supply of seeds and planting materials of 
various crops. Cardamom Research Station, Pampadumpara is a substation of RARS 
 
 31 
 
 
 
Ambalavayal and the station is maintaining a germplasm bank of 77 cultivated and 14 wild types 
of cardamom. In central zone, nine research stations are functioning for providing research and 
extension services for rice, banana, cashew, vegetables, medicinal plants, pineapple, passion 
fruit etc. Various crop varieties including banana, cashew has been released for cultivation 
through these centres. There are also functioning four stations in a special zone for problem 
areas to carry out research on rice, pokkali rice etc., and to address the problems of Kuttanadu 
and Onattukara regions. In Onattukara zone one station is functioning for conducting research on 
Onattukara coconut. In southern zone four stations are functioning for various crop 
improvement, research and extension services. 
3.4 Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS) 
Regional Agricultural Research Station comes under the Kerala Agricultural University and is 
located at Pattambi, Palakkad district. The lead function of the station is to conduct research 
mainly on rice, pulses, horticultural crops and rice-based farming systems. The institute aims at 
sustainable food production by providing technology backup for better production and safe 
production practices. It also aims at rendering basic knowledge and practical experience in the 
field to the youngsters who are interested in agriculture through its academic programmes. The 
station was upgraded as Regional Agricultural Research Station for Central Zone comprising of 
Ernakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad and Malappuram districtsunder the National Agricultural 
Research Programme (NARP) in 1981. The first high yielding hybrid derivative variety of rice 
of South-East Asia ―Annapoorna (Ptb-35)‖ was released for cultivation by this station in 1966. 
RARS is concentrating on the collection and conservation of rice diversity in the state, which is 
the most important crop of Kerala. There were three major seasons in Kerala for paddy 
cultivation i.e., Virippu (April-May to September-October),Mundakan (July-August to February-
March) and Puncha (January-February to April-May). More than thousands of rice varieties, 
which were in cultivation during different seasons, have been collected and conserved in a well 
maintained deep-freeze laboratory. Traditional varieties of paddy were well suited for the 
different agro-climatic conditions in the state. The conservation of such varieties without losing 
its traits has been maintained in the centre. The RARS is providing traditional varieties of rice to 
farmers who are interested in their cultivation. Such varieties can be considered as parent seeds 
for breeding purposes for getting new traits and advantages through the research. The RARS is 
maintaining acres of paddy land for the cultivation of rice varieties to get their new seeds for the 
purpose of conservation. Based on different rice varieties, there are different time periods. 
Among the traditional varieties of rice, some of them have special characteristics also. The 13 
rice varieties which have resistance to salinity (seven types of pokkali, four types grown in the 
saline land of Pannanikole wet land, and two types of Kaippadu land) have been identified. Ten 
drought-resistant varieties and 12 flood-resistant varieties have also been identified. Seven types 
of scented rice varieties (like jeerakasala, gandhakasala,neycheeraetc.), seventeen varieties with 
medicinal value (navara, nallachennellu, rakthasali etc.), and three types of good cooking 
quality have been characterised as special traditional varieties.   
The traditional rice varieties have been donors for various traits in the rice breeding programmes 
worldwide. The rice improvement efforts had been made in the station in earlier times before the 
green revolution and resulted in the popularisation of various rice varieties. Pattambi rice 
varieties are internationally acclaimed for their performance and accepted as international donors 
for biotic and a-biotic stress breeding (75 years of research, RARS, Pattambi-2002). A lot of new 
varieties have been developed considering the high yielding possibilities and different agro-
climatic situations in Kerala. The varieties with disease-resistant, pest resistant, survival capacity 
of climate conditions, etc., have been developed by the station.  It is reported that the yield of 
 
 32 
 
 
 
traditional varieties will be lower, but the traits will be higher. The farmers are interested in 
cultivating high yielding varieties because of the expectation of profitability of cultivation. Now 
the area under paddy cultivation is going to come down due to high cost of cultivation, fear of 
loss etc. Though, some farmers who are interested in cultivation of paddy as a passion are 
approaching the station for collecting such rice varieties. Outlets of the RARS are functioning 
for the public to distribute paddy seeds. Farmer support programmes, awareness campaigns are 
also being conducted. Supply of rice varieties in association with agricultural departments is also 
going on. RARS is functioning as a promoting agency for rice cultivation under Kerala 
Agricultural University, which is fostering the rice diversity in the state. 
3.5 National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR) 
NBPGR is an institute coming under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research for the 
Management and promotion of sustainable use of plant genetic and genomic resources of agri-
horticultural crop and carriesout related research. The establishment of the Bureau coincided 
with the advent of the Green Revolution and was in response to the realisation of perceived 
effects of the Green Revolution on agrobiodiversity. The NBPGR played a pivotal role in the 
improvement of various crop plants, diversification and development of agriculture in India 
through germplasm introduction from various institutes located in foreign countries and also 
from within the country. Headquarter of NBPGR is located at New Delhi, and the regional 
centre of Kerala is located at Thrissur.  
NBPGR is a major institute which exclusively functions for the conservation of agrobiodiversity. 
NBPGR is conserving indigenous plant genetic diversity at the national level. A gene bank for 
indigenous and exotic collections, wild crop relatives, etc., has been maintained and the details 
of it havebeen made available on the PGR database. It is the only source of plant genetic 
diversity that imparts valuable traits needed for meeting the challenges of adapting crop 
varieties. Considering the future needs to address changing climatic conditions or disease of 
crops, all plant genetic diversity has its own relevance and NBPGR is keeping it in a systematic 
way. NBPGR, Thrissur is maintaining 10.4 ha. farm area for cultivating various crop varieties to 
get new seeds for the conservation purposes based on the particular time periods which depends 
on the characteristics of the crop varieties. A scientific laboratory has been well maintained for 
the conservation. Seeds are being well packed and coded and stored in the deep freeze 
laboratory. The mandate of the centre is augmentation, characterisation, evaluation, 
maintenance, regeneration, conservation, documentation and distribution of plant genetic 
resources in South India. Jurisdiction of this centre is Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Goa, 
Union Territories of Puducherry, Lakshadweep and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  
As per the gene bank database of NBPGR indigenous collections from Kerala is 4333 which 
includes 1833 cereals, 972 vegetables, 204 medicinal and aromatic plants, 146 Pseudo cereals 
etc. (Table-7). Out of the 1833 cereals, 1825 is rice varieties, and the rest is maize and wheat.

NBPGR initiated to popularise the potential crops (like non-bitter type of Aloe Vera, Dwarf 
Burmese fishtail palm collected from Andaman Islands, Chop-Chopa- a good monsoon season 
fruit, Sweet gourd and teasel gourd etc.,) among the farmers, tribes as vegetables and economic 
plants for food and livelihood security. As far as germplasm conservation is concerned a total of 
8306 accessions comprising 74 crops and their wild relatives and other economic plants are 
maintained (in field gene bank and medium-term storage), and 18680 accessions were sent to 
National Gene Bank for long term storage (as per the documents of NBPGR). Germplasm 
collections of different perennial horticultural crops have been transferred to various crop-based 
institutions like CTCRI Trivandrum, IISR Kozhikode etc. Also, it has been supplied to the 
various user agencies, government institutes under Material Transfer Agreement (MTA).  
It is reported that Kerala Agricultural University has released seven varieties using germplasm of 
NBPGR. The released varieties are Brinjal-Neelima(having high yield potential and disease 
resistant), Chinese Potato-Nidhi (having high yield, large tubers, good cooking quality and 
suitable as a short duration vegetable crop in Kerala), Greater Yam-Indu, Okra-Salkeerthi, 
Aruna, Manjima (having high yield potential), and Yard-long Been-Kairali. Eight accessions 
with unique traits were registered by the ICAR-Plant Germplasm Registration Committee based 
on the evaluation and characterisation of germplasm. NBPGR conducts exhibitions, Biodiversity 
Fairs for awareness generation, training for farmers etc. 
NBPGR is a major institution for the conservation of plant genetic resources from all 
geographical regions of the nation. Regeneration, conservation, augmentation, characterisation 
and evaluation of plants are being operated successfully in connection with agrobiodiversity 
conservation. The extension possibilities are limited, though they are supplying seeds to the 
needy farmers and conducting training and awareness programmes. 
3.6 Non-Governmental Organizations 
3.6.1 M S Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) 
MSSRF was established in 1988 as a non-profit trust. It is an NGO which actively engages in the 
area of agrobiodiversity and aims at accelerating the use of modern science and technology for 
agricultural and rural development for improving the lives of communities. MSSRF Chennai has 
established a regional centre at Wayanad in 1997 namely Community Agrobiodiversity Centre 
(CAbC) to promote community conservation systems of rural and tribal people through research, 
extension and advocacy. Centre actively works for sustainable agricultural and rural 
development with the partnership of rural and farming communities. The activities of MSSRF 
are designed as pro-nature, pro-poor, pro-woman and pro-livelihood orientation.  
The Centre works with an objective of delivering the necessary means and methods required for 
the on-farm management of agrobiodiversity in Wayanad region –a Biodiversity and poverty

hotspot in the Western Ghats. The Centre, since its establishment, has been working in 
partnership with local community families with an integrated approach of conservation, 
cultivation, consumption and enhancing commercial prospects of community biodiversity 
management. Establishment and evaluation of crop Germplasm is an important area in 
agrobiodiversity conservation. MSSRF has taken efforts to establish a food crop Germplasm 
including components like root tuber crops, leguminous crops and spices. The details of 
collections at the centre and the community level conservation sites are given in the table below:

Recognising the importance of rice from the point of view of agrobiodiversity, MSSRF initiated 
traditional rice conservation programme in the year 1998 in Wayanad. Initial activities on rice 
conservation were restricted to sensitization of farmers about the importance of rice ecosystems 
and production and distribution of quality seeds of traditional rice varieties. MSSRF worked in 
close collaboration with farmer groups in different parts of the district. Participatory plant 
breeding programme was also initiated on medicinal rice like Navara. Cultivation of Navara and 
other speciality rice varieties like Gandhakasala and Jeerakasala were promoted to exploit its 
market potential to generate profit from rice cultivation. The yield from traditional rice varieties 
is less, but the properties will be higher. People are generally not willing to cultivate traditional 
varieties because of low yield and fear of loss. The fact is that tribes are cultivating traditional 
varieties only. Propagating traditional varieties among the farmers is a challenge even though it 
has been undertaken by the centre.  
In the promotion of agrobiodiversity MSSRF is actively concentrating on promotion of 
community-oriented agro farming, particularly in rice cultivation. Also, the centre provides 
training to farmers to conserve traditional crops. It renders support and technical assistance to 
enhance the traditional agricultural production in rice and tubers for ensuring sustainable and 
profitable agricultural practices, especially among tribes.  
 
 35 
 
 
 
In view of biodiversity conservation, they are maintaining a botanical garden full of endemic 
floral species, medicinal plants and Rare Endangered and Threatened (RET) plants etc. Floristic 
wealth of Wayanad district has been explored with special emphasis on endemic and threatened 
flowering plant species. A total of 2,034 plant species were documented from 2136 sq. km area, 
26 new taxa were discovered, 2 plant species were rediscovered after long gaps since their last 
report, 184 wild edible species, 244 medicinal species and 165 orchids were documented. A total 
of 190 threatened plant species of Western Ghats (more than 1.8 lakh seedlings) are being 
conserved through an integrated approach (in-situ, ex-situ & on farm). Recovery plan for RET 
species is also being conducted through identification of natural population of threatened 
species, along with study of the ecology and biology of threatened species, large scale 
multiplication of prioritized species, and reintroduction/introduction into natural/suitable 
habitats. 
MSSRF is maintaining good relations with the local governments in the areas of natural resource 
management, 
livelihood 
improvement, 
biodiversity 
conservation, 
climate 
change 
adaptation/mitigation. All support has been provided for the creation of artificial forest, and 
conducted a floristic study at Pathirippara, in association with Meenangadi grama panchayat. 
MSSRF is also participating in their carbon-neutral further programmes. MSSRF has a close 
association with Pozhuthana panchayat in implementing medicinal plants conservation 
programs, river protection programmes etc. Earlier MSSRF has worked with Padinjarathara 
panchayat in establishing a bio-village program. It is reported that MSSRF has established 20 
rice seed villages across Wayanad, in which many panchayats are associated. A noticeable point 
is that MSSRF was actively involvedin providing assistance in the preparation of PBR of local 
governments like Pozhuthana grama panchayat and Kalpetta municipality.  
MSSRF- CAbC is one of the most important institutions in the state, which closely associates 
with the promotion of agrobiodiversity. Great importance is attached to the environment 
conservation activities of MSSRF, particularly in the biodiversity hotspot district Wayanad.  
3.6.2 Thanal 
Thanal is an NGO functioning from 1986 in the field of environment conservation. The head 
office of Thanal is located at Thiruvananthapuram. The key areas of the institution are the 
promotion of organic farming, agroecology, zero waste, policy advocacy, climate change, 
circular economy, break free from plastics, living ecosystems and agrobiodiversity conservation. 
Thanal was actively involved in the environment campaigns against the rise in pesticide use like 
Endosulfan. Thanal successfully facilitated zero waste campaigns, which include initiatives like 
zero waste Himalayas.  
Thanal has been managing the Agro-Ecology Centre (AEC), a field centre at Panavally in 
Wayanad since 2010.The centre is dedicated to the conservation of indigenous crop diversity of 
paddy, tubers, turmeric, ginger and uncultivated wild leafy vegetables. It conducts seed festival 
every year and also rice field days for students, farmers and Kudumbasree groups. The centre is 
also a research and education centre affiliated to International People‘s Agroecology 
Multiversity offering programmes in which farmers are lead faculties. The centre is interacting 
with academics and practitioners of organic farming to contribute to knowledge generation on 
Agroecology. 
Training in organic farming, organic input preparation and preparation of organic pest repellents 
are being provided for farmers. Promotion of organic products and organic farming techniques is 
an important activity. Conducting awareness campaigns for ecosystem protection, conducting 
research on biodiversity conservation are the other major activities. Thanal is promoting organic 
 
 36 
 
 
 
farming since 1990 and is practising in Thanal AEC. The manures are prepared organically 
using cow dung, cow urine etc. (Thanal keeps its cows in the centre itself). Also, fence compost 
is being maintained in the centre. The centre provides training to the farmers in organic farming 
since 2003 and has been helping them to market their products through the Organic Bazaar. 
Thanal so far has trained more than 200 master trainers for organic farming training and runs 
three facilities in the state to train farmers and youth on organic farming. 
The Save our Rice Campaign, which is a national movement, was organised by Thanal in Kerala 
to revive the paddy diversity of the farming system. It is reported that thousands of farmers in 
five states are adopting ecological farming practices, conserving and cultivating traditional 
varieties of high-quality seeds, and ensuring the supply of organic rice to consumers across these 
states. Conservation of traditional paddy varieties in Rice Diversity Block has been established 
as part of Save our Rice Campaign. 
Thanal is conserving several crop species including 336 traditional varieties of rice, 16 
vegetables, 25 uncultivated vegetables, 7 ginger etc. (Table9). Thanal is managing on-farm 
conservation of 336 traditional varieties of rice. Organising seed festival and exchange of 
traditional seeds without monetising and trading is another initiative.

In association with Meenangadi grama panchayat,Wayanad, a carbon-neutral study has been 
conducted. It was a unique attempt to assess the carbon emission in the panchayat area 
particularly in Wayanad district which has ecological significance. Carbon emission was 
estimated from transportation, energy, waste, Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use 
(AFOLU). This has motivated other grama panchayats to assess carbon emission to address 
climate change.  
It could thus be seen that the two non-governmental organizations are playing a very important 
role in diffusing technology to farmers and also in conserving a number of crop species thereby 
saving it from extinction and (re)introducing them into everyday use. 
3.7 PRIs dealing with biodiversity in general 
3.7.1 Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanical Garden Research Institute (JNTBGRI) 
JNTBGRI was established in 1979 under Government of Kerala as an autonomous institution 
and located at Palode, foothills of the Western Ghats, Thiruvananthapuram. It has become a part 
of the Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment in 2003. The institute was 
envisioned to conserve and provide sustainable utilisation of the plant biodiversity of the 
Western Ghats for the well being of the people. The key areas of the centre are Ex-situ 
 
 37 
 
 
 
conservation and management of plant wealth of the country, biodiversity documentation, 
bioprospecting, documentation of indigenous knowledge, education, extension, training on 
conservation and sustainable utilisation of plants etc. 
JNTBGRI is renowned for its well maintained Botanical Garden spread over 300 acres. The 
garden system of JNTBGRI is reckoned as the biggest conservatory garden in Asia with over 
50,000 accessions belonging to about 5,000 species. The Garden system is managed by the 
Garden Management Education, Information and Technology Division and the Plant Genetic 
Resources Division. These divisions manage the live plants of the Garden. The institute is 
systematically conserving medicinal plants, orchids and other flowering plants, bamboos, 
various rare species of flora from other parts of India, agricultural crops, spices etc.  Exploring 
the traits of plant wealth of Western Ghats region for the well being of people through research 
is a distinctive effort.  
 
JNTBGRI is actively engaged in developing effective regeneration protocols for many species to 
help conservation, eco-rehabilitation and sustainable utilization through biotechnological 
approach. Thrust areas of the centre are conservation, biotechnology, bioproduction of plant-
specific compounds and bio-prospecting. Bio-technology based cultivation of endangered plant 
taxa became a reality in India largely through the work done in the laboratories of the centre. 
The institute played a great role in biodiversity management through assessing the status of 
selected species, bio-prospecting of selected species and also through multiplication and 
popularisation of important plants. RET plants in the Western Ghats region have been identified 
and conserved properly. It is reported that a database of RET species is being prepared. 
Conservation and re-introduction of selected RET species are being carried out in the institute. 
New varieties of Orchids and Bamboos have been developed through hybridisation. The institute 
strives to develop disease-resistant plants through hybridisation which is a significant effort in 
the context of agrobiodiversity promotion. The institute is providing technical support, 
mentoring local governments for biodiversity conservation, natural resource management etc.  
Several achievements have been made through the research effort of the institute. JEEVANI, a 
novel herbal formulation for health promotion, has been developed and the technology was 
transferred to Arya Vaidya Pharmacy (Coimbatore) Ltd. Kanjikode, Kerala, for commercial 
production. SISAIROSP as an anti-psoriatic and antidandruff herbal formulation and the 
technology was transferred to a Madhya Pradesh based company, Jhawar Chemicals Pvt.Ltd. A 
considerable income has been generated to the institute by transferring technologies of both of 
these two herbal drugs (JEEVANI and SISAIROSP). Also, five Plant-based databases have been 
developed by the institute. Eighteen patents in the fields of biotechnology, ethnopharmacology 
and bio-prospecting have been filed, of which seven have been granted. 
 
Being a large conservatory garden in the country, JNTBGRI disseminates the message on the 
significance of plant diversity among a vast group of its visitors. Also, the institute is regularly 
conducting exhibitions, training programmes and public interactions. Publications like handouts 
and brochures also help to spread the message on the relevance of conservation. Popularisation 
of plant species among the public is an important activity of the institute. JNTBGRI is 
conserving biodiversity through the protection of various species of plant wealth (Table 10), 
developing new varieties, re-introduction of species, maintaining the biggest conservatory 
garden in Asia.

3.7.2Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI) 
KFRI was founded by Government of Kerala in 1975 to conduct research on tropical forests and 
forestry. Institute has become part of Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and 
Environment (KSCSTE) in 2003. The main campus of the institute is located at Peechi, Thrissur. 
A sub-centre is functioning at Nilamboor with laboratory facilities and field trial plots of several 
tree species. A Field Research Centre is functioning under KFRI at Velupadam,Thrissur with a 
nursery of forest plant species. KFRI is functioning for the conservation of forest ecosystem and 
sustainable utilisation of natural resources for ensuring benefits to the society. The institute is 
conducting multi-disciplinary research on tropical forestry including wildlife management, 
indigenous knowledge, value addition of forest product etc. KFRI has 17 research departments 
grouped under 9 Programme Divisions. KFRI is managing research and other activities through 
these divisions.   
KFRI is maintaining Arboretum of a wide variety of evergreen and moist deciduous trees, 
Bamboo garden, a Butterfly garden with micro habitats for attracting rare, endemic and 
endangered butterflies. They are also maintaining a Central nursery, Herbarium with an 
extensive collection of flowering plants, Bioresources Nature Park at Nilamboor, Medicinal 
plants garden, Soil museum, Kerala Forest Seed Centre etc. The Central nursery has a collection 
of about 120 species of timber (that are high in demand) and also fruit-bearing and medicinal 
plants. The nursery ensures timely availability of planting material to the farmers, the general 
public and other agencies. Kerala Forest Seed Centre established as a joint venture in 2003 with 
Kerala Forest& Wildlife Department for gathering forest seeds of superior trees and distributing 
certified seeds to the other government departments, NGOs, and farmers.  
 
 
 39 
 
 
 
KFRI collects the diversity of forest soil and mineral resources in the state which is kept in the 
soil museum. The museum has the collection of 15 soil monoliths featuring the soils in different 
types of forests like shoal, evergreen, semi-evergreen, moist and dry deciduous etc. 
In view of biodiversity conservation KFRI intervenes through the research efforts in the areas of  
silviculture and soil science, genetics and tree breeding, forest ecology, ecosystem and landscape 
analysis, rehabilitation and restoration, population ecology, biodiversity evaluation and 
conservation of RET species of flora etc. Apart from this KFRI looks into various aspects of 
microbes, insects and weeds in the forest ecosystem, developing appropriate technologies for the 
value-added commercial utilization of timbers, conducting interdisciplinary research into human 
behaviours in natural environments, providing fully-fledged training and extension facility for 
imparting training in tropical forestry, mapping forest cover and biodiversity by using GIS and 
remote sensing etc. 
KFRI is actively involved in the area of Agroforestry, which is a land use management system 
combining benefits of both agriculture and forestry. Agroforestry has great importance in the 
state because it is dependent on the Western Ghats region blessed withabundant natural 
resources. In agroforestry perspective, KFRI puts forward different crop based homestead 
models based on different structures of home gardens in various agro-climatic zones in the state 
for benefitting the farmers.Tree species are being proposed toprovide indirect benefits and also 
ensure self-sufficiency in case of food, fuel, wood, fodder, fruit yields, good qualitytimber and 
considerable good returns from the cash crops. It also promotesa mixed pattern of agriculture 
with selected plants for getting considerable income to the farmers. Developing sustainable 
models of agroforestry system through farmer-participatory approach for each agro-ecological 
zone is a major intervention of KFRI. 
Creation of a Butterfly garden is another initiative to conserve biodiversity. The institute is 
creating a garden of particular selected plant species based on specificities of location for 
attracting butterflies in schools, hospitals, public institutions etc., as per the demand. Also, 
regular monitoring has been ensured. The butterfly garden helps to improve the ecosystem 
around as butterflies help in pollination of plants, increasing floral richness. 
KFRI is propagating scientific models for the sustainable use of natural resources like soil, 
water, various species of plants, trees, ecologically sound land use pattern etc. The institute is 
also supplying plants, providing technical support, conservation methods, to the agencies, local 
governments, NGOs, farmers etc. The role of this institute is precious in front of conservation of 
biodiversity, particularly in forestry resources of the state, which is closely associated with the 
Western Ghats. 
3.8 Insights from the analysis of the role of PRIs and NGOs 
1. Institutions are maintaining germplasm conservation of various kinds of crops, including 
traditional varieties with the vision of future needs. 
2. New varieties have been developed through crop improvement for high yield, disease 
resistance, etc.  
3. Institutions are facing challenges and limitations in the extension services. Only 
passionate farmers or interested agencies are utilising the services of these institutions. 
Lack of proper knowledge about these institutions and the importance of agricultural 
practices among the public are serious concerns. 
4. In view of the extension possibilities, NGOs are seen to be performing better as 
compared to the government institutions, by collaborating with local governments and 
 
 40 
 
 
 
intervention at grassroots level through community mobilisation. Collaboration with 
local governments is more significant in the promotion of agrobiodiversity.  
5. Absence of a central monitoring system in order to promote agrobiodiversity in the state, 
to coordinate all the research outputs from the public research institutions has been 
noticed. 
4. The cases of 4 modelGrama Panchayats 
In this section, we analyse the role of four local self-governments from across Kerala who can 
justifiably be termed as model grama panchayats as far as the appreciation and maintenance of 
agrobiodiversity and indeed biodiversity, in general, is concerned. Our selection of these 
panchayats hasbeen guided by the fact that they have either been selected as the best 
BMCseither by the National Biodiversity Authority or the Kerala State Biodiversity Board 
(Table 11)12. Besides, one of the four has been hailed as a model panchayat for organic vegetable 
cultivation and has a long history of being the only panchayat in the whole state of Kerala that is 
self-sufficient in vegetable cultivation. The purpose of conducting these case studies is to 
understand and place on the table those practical points that other panchayats can emulate. It is 
also seen that all the four panchayats have adopted a different strategy towards agrobiodiversity 
thus bringing home the point that there is no one model that fits all. Each of the panchayats have 
improvised strategies that are specific to the needs of respective panchayats. These range from 
rejuvenation and maintenance of water bodies to vegetable cultivation to maintenance of forest 
cover. We also see that success in the maintenance of agrobiodiversity is linked to the presence 
of two important factors. These are: (i) a strategy for agrobiodiversity is basically a function of 
whether it is inexorably linked to a livelihood strategy. If it is, then there can be widespread 
acceptance of management of agrobiodiversity as it can bring in immediate tangible benefits to 
the inhabitants of those villages. Otherwise, the notion of agrobiodiversity can remain as a 
theoretical concept, the benefits of which are understood only by a few people who are 
environmentally oriented. Such individuals are, unfortunately, short in supply; and (ii) successful 
implementation of the agrobiodiversity strategy requires the presence of a charismatic mentor 
whose leadership is widely accepted and who is extremely resourceful. It is very often the 
presence of such individuals who make a big difference to the successful implementation of 
agrobiodiversity policies and not other institutional mechanisms such as the BMCs.This, of 
course, has the danger of the whole strategy fizzling out with the eclipse of this mentor from the 
horizon.

Against this background,this section of the study discusses the four cases. The case studies are 
structured as follows. We first provide a brief profile of the panchayat. This is followed by a 
discussion and evaluation of the 
formal 
institutional 
mechanism 
for 
maintaining 
agrobiodiversity, namely the formation of a BMC and the existence of a PBR. Subsequently, we 
distil out the specific strategies adopted by the villages. The common insights that we could 
learn from the four are summarised and presented in this section as well. 
4.1 KanjikuzhiGrama Panchayat- Agrobiodiversity through livelihood strategies 
 
 
Profile:Kanjikuzhigrama panchayat is situated in Kanjikuzhiblock panchayat of Alappuzha 
district bounded by Mannancherry, Muhamma, Thanneermukkam and Mararikkulamgrama 
panchayats. The total geographical area of the grama panchayat is 16.62 sq.kms. The panchayat 
has 8516 families across 18 wards and the total population is 29951 persons 13. Beginning from 
1994 Kanjikuzhisurpassed its geographical deficit of being sand-like soil-deprived region which 
was not suitable for vegetable cultivation with the collective effort of panchayat and 
government.  The panchayat decided to come up with different policies and programmes that 
would encourage farmers to initiate organic farming with utmost dedication. In fact, twenty 
years down the line it is the only panchayat in the state that is self-sufficient in vegetable 
cultivation. The panchayat has a diverse cropping pattern (see Table 12).

BMC was formed in 2008, consisting of 8 members as per the guidelines. In 2011 BMC 
prepared People‘s Biodiversity Register (PBR). The BMC was reconstituted in 2015, but the 
minutes of the meeting are not available. After the reconstitution of the BMC, it has not been 
active, and no meeting has been conducted so far. The technical assistance and financial support 
from the State Biodiversity Board (SBB) havebeen received for the preparation of PBR. The 
BMC reported that they have participated in various training programmes conducted by the 
KSBB. It is reported that after the preparation of PBR, BMC is actively involved in the 
protection of ‗kaavu‘ and afforestation activities by utilising MGNREGS labourers.  
 
The Panchayat is associated with Kudumbasreeand Harithakeralam Mission to implement an 
eco-friendly waste management system. Plastic waste is being collected from the houses and

institutions every month by KudumbasreeHarithakarmaSena at the rate of Rs.30/- per 
household. Harithakeralam Mission collects this waste for recycling purpose.  
 
PBR 
The PBR was prepared in 2011 July as per the instructions of KSBB. BMC members reported 
that the survey team comprising of Kudumbasree members, local people (who had traditional 
knowledge), students etc. have been deputed for each ward to collect the data. Each team 
consisted of nearly 20 people who are actively involved in the survey. They have collected 
information from the ward level and then consolidated it as per the guidance from the KSSB 
coordinators. The coordinators of KSBB have visited the Panchayat and have given orientation 
training to the survey team. The preparation of PBR was completed within three months. Yearly 
updation of the PBR seems to be missing in this panchayat. Therefore, verification of the bio-
diversity and species mentioned in the PBR was not possible.  Moreover, the BMC was not 
active after this exercise. In 2015, BMC was reconstituted by the Panchayat but no Action Plan 
has been formulated since then. The PBR is not updated and it is reported that they have not 
received any clear order from KSBB for the updation of PBR. Annual review of PBR has not 
been conducted so far.  
 
Agrobiodiversity of the Panchayat is significant as per the PBR. In the Panchayat 120 species of 
various crops are being cultivated. It includes 10 varieties of paddy and coconut, 41 varieties of 
12 vegetables, 8 varieties of tapioca, 9 varieties of yam and 18 varieties of other tubers. Forty-
seven varieties of medicinal plants were identified, and most of them come under the RET 
category. In the case of wild plants, 81 varieties of medicinal plants, 15 wild crops and 52 wild 
trees were also identified. As per the PBR 47 varieties of livestock and pets are being reared in 
the Panchayat. As far as ecosystem diversity is concerned, 44 kaavuand 22 wet lands have been 
identified. The cropping pattern of the panchayat is presented in Table 12.  
 
It is reported that Panchayat is protecting ponds and water bodies by using geo-textiles (coir 
bhoovasthram) on the walls of ponds and canals with the help of MGNREGS workers. Cleaning 
of these water bodies has also been completed by utilising this scheme effectively. Planting 
trees, construction of bio fencing (jaivaveli), were the major activities of the Panchayat to protect 
Illathukaavu. Illathukaavuis popular with endemic species of wild plants like calophyllumcalaba 
locally known as cherupunna).But in the field visit, bio fencing was not seen anywhere in the 
kaavu and it was demolished and the premises of kaavu was being utilised as a playground. Lack 
of proper fencing and protection literally turned the kaavu into a littering ground. Only the fallen 
trees are not been taken away mainly because that is forbidden as per the local belief. A temple 
is still functioning in the middle of the kaavu. Such temples may be part of this entire kaavu 
ecology, but the question is how to protect the flora and fauna with the existence of a temple and 
activity around it. The panchayat is yet evolving a reasonable strategy to conserve this sacred 
place because, it seems, the existing mechanism will adversely affect the health and existence 
ofthekaavu in the long run.  
 
The primary function of the BMC is to maintain a document on local biological resources and 
associated traditional knowledge. Conservation, sustainable use, and documentation of 
biodiversity and equitable sharing of benefits, arising from its use, are also coming under the 
mandate of BMC. Generally, most of the Biodiversity Management Committees (BMC) in all 
local self-government institutions is not functional after the preparation of PBR and have failed 
to exercise their power and responsibility mainly due to the lack of awareness. Kanjikuzhi 
panchayat is also an example of this. 
 
 
 
 43 
 
 
 
The panchayat has been very successful in maintaining agrobiodiversity in the panchayat by 
linking it to livelihood strategy and this appears to be working well as the people are deriving a 
continuous source of income. Although the formal institutional mechanism for managing 
agrobiodiversity exists in the panchayat, these have been invoked very rarely. The experience of 
the panchayat though worthy of emulation has not even been followed by neighbouring 
panchayats.

Eraviperoor grama panchayat is notable for its good governance and effective service delivery. 
Eraviperoor has become the first grama panchayat in the country to receive a national award for 
public administration. Moreover, this is also the maiden public administration award received by 
an institution or individual from Kerala. Eraviperoor grama panchayat has been recognised and 
awarded from several times for its excellence in the service delivery and now it becomes 
Eraviperoormodel, which is replicating 12 States.  
 
In 2013, Eraviperoor was selected for the award for biodiversity conservation instituted by the 
State Biodiversity Board and the Sanitation Award of the State Sanitation Mission. In the same 
year, the state Horticulture Department selected the village as a model hi-tech green village on 
account of banana plantations by 42 women groups who cooperated with each other to earn 
profits not just for themselves, but also for the village. This is the only panchayat in the state has 
received ISO-9001 certification for it's Primary Health Centre (PHC). It has also won the state 
government‘s Health Award and Pain and Palliative Care Award for 2014-15. Now the PHC is 
converted as Family Health Centre (FHC) under Aardram Mission of Government of Kerala. 
FHC is functioning with ample facilities of Yoga, Fitness Centres etc. with the integration of the 
Ayush project. As far as the activities of Biodiversity Management Committee (BMC) are 
concerned, the panchayat was chosen for the award for Best BMC from National Biodiversity 
Authority in 2018. 
 
Eraviperoor became the first grama panchayat in the country to provide free Wi-Fi to the general 
public. Villagers can access free Wi-Fi facility within a one-kilometre radius of five different 
panchayat institutions. Besides this, the panchayat has touch screen kiosks for the public to 
locate their files in ultra-modern Panchayat record rooms. The panchayat has given priority to e-
governance at the grassroots level. It is reported that the panchayat is planning to implement 
‗Panchayat to People Kiosks‘ programme under its own risk. People can access the services of 
panchayat within their locality through these Kiosks. Software has been developed to implement 
this programme. 
 
BMC 
BMC was initially constituted on 10/12/2010 and reconstituted on 18/01/2015 with a 
chairperson, convenor, secretary and seven members. The major mandate of the BMC was the 
preparation of Peoples Biodiversity Register (PBR) in the beginning period; it was prepared on 
February 2011. The panchayat officials reported that BMC is functioning with three major areas, 
i.e., water conservation, food security and protection of the environment.  
 
Water conservation 
The panchayat constructed 1.45 lakhs rain pits for groundwater recharging under the monitoring 
of BMC. Protection and reformation of traditional water bodies, and mini drinking water 
projects, Sujalam drinking water project in association with the M S Swaminathan Foundation 
are the other projects implementing underwater conservation.  
 
PBR 
BMC reported that technical supports and capacity building had been received from state 
Biodiversity Board in the initial period for the preparation of PBR. Within the one year period, 
the whole process of preparation of PBR had been completed. The survey group for each ward 
had been formulated comprising of Kudumbashree members, local people and students to collect 
data. Total of 63 persons had been engaged in the survey for all wards. The survey had been 
completed within two months. There was no delay in preparation of PBR. Eraviperoor became 
the first grama panchayat in Pathanamthitta district in preparation of PBR. Financial support 
 
 45 
 
 
 
from KSBB has been received by the panchayat for the preparation of PBR, creation of Star 
Forest and Carbon Neutral Project.  
 
BMC has prepared a project as part of its Action Plan for the construction of organic fertiliser 
unit. This unit will collect all type of organic waste from the panchayat area for the processing of 
fertiliser. It is expected to avoid chemical fertilisers from the agricultural sector by supplying 
this organic fertiliser for the cultivation of Eraviperoor Rice and other agricultural crops. 
Organic farming has been promoting in the agricultural sector, especially for vegetables, but 
farmers are using chemical fertilisers in the paddy cultivation (Eraviperoor rice) extensively. 
 
There was no separate scheme prepared for the protection of Kaavu,-wetland ecosystems. 
Annual review of PBR has not been conducted so far. As far as protection of natural resources is 
concerned, BMC is planning to implement ‗Tree Pledging instead of Cutting‘ Project, Varattar 
Protection Scheme, Implementation of user fee for the houses having tiled courtyard etc. 
 
As per the PBR data, nearly 140 varieties of agricultural crops have been cultivated including 
food crops, cash crops, spices, vegetables and tubers. Out of this 35 varieties of vegetables and 
40 varieties of tubers had been identified. In the PBR, 104 varieties of medicinal plants, 76 wild 
animals, 10 items of flora and 15 items of fauna in the water bodies, had been recorded. Only 24 
varieties of livestock and pets are being reared in the Panchayat. Two rivers (Varattar and 
Manimala), one canal and 4 thodu (water streams) and 2 ponds (under private custody) have 
been identified as water bodies within the panchayat area. BMC reported that PBR has to be 
updated and digitalised by adding up of new data based on the new survey. It is expected to be 
achieved within a short period of time. 
 
From the field level observation,Eraviperoor panchayat is ensuring the involvement of BMC in 
the process of implementation of several conventional projects of grama panchayats also like 
construction of rain pits, agricultural promotion, providing drinking water etc., given these 
projects are related to environment assets. Rejuvenation of Varattar river, efforts for removing 
encroachments, etc., were the outstanding measures in front of the environment protection. A 
notable point is that conducting Eco-Grama Sabha in all wards was a unique attempt of 
Eraviperoor grama panchayat and it generated environmental awareness among the people. It 
also encouraged disclosing more suggestions and ensuring the participation of people in 
environment conservation.  
4.2.1 Varattar-Aadi Pamba rejuvenation 
The most important activity of BMC was the rejuvenation of a river - -Varattar and Aadi Pamba. 
Varattaar is a tributary of Aadi Pamba and it reaches Manimala River. Varattar was the main 
source of water for hundreds of households in its earlier period. This river had a natural 
importance that acted as a natural flood control mechanism between Pamba and Manimala 
rivers, carrying the excess water from both ways. Due to the land encroachment and sand 
mining, it became a drought river forthelast 35 years, and some people were using the banks of 
this area for cultivation purpose. The grama panchayat has taken initiatives to sketch out the 
boundaries of the river using land records. It is reported that there were many hurdles that had 
tobefaced in the initial time. BMC prepared an action plan under MGNREGS to rejuvenate the 
river, and the activities started in 2013-14. The rejuvenation activities were implemented with 
the people‘s participation. All obstructions towards the natural pathway of the river were 
removed by cleaning and chopping away of branches of trees by MGNREGS workers and local 
people, and removal culverts across the river.

(Photo is taken from Panchayat records-PPT slides) 
 
13.5 acres of riverbank has been regained with the magnificent efforts of the panchayat. The 
DPR is prepared and submitted to the Haritha KeralamMission. The first stage has been 
completed within 3 months without any government aid, but Rs.80 crore has been announced for 
the rejuvenation by the state government in the second stage.  
 
Varattar is flowing through the nearest local governments of Eraviperoor, i.e. Koippram and 
Kuttoor panchayats and Chengannoor municipality. Eraviperoor panchayat has triggered actions 
atthe beginning for the rejuvenation of Varattaar. It generated a compulsion to participate in 
other nearest local governments which are sharing the banks of Varattar. The rejuvenation of the 
river programme has become the major environmental conservation programme of nearest 
panchayats and Chengannoor municipality along with Eraviperoor panchayat with the support of 
district administration and Haritha Keralam Mission. 
 
Varatte...Aaru.....(Let river come) Riverwalk campaign was organised by the local governments 
and hundreds of people gathered on the banks of Varattar river including political leaders, 
ministers and MLAs. It was a noticeable campaign, and it created awareness among the local 
people about the importance to rejuvenate the river. The river rejuvenation programme comes 
under the purview of state recognised River Rejuvenation Scheme now.  
 
Riverwalk campaign  
 
 
The flowing river  
(Phots are taken from Panchayat records-PPT slides) 
 
The grama panchayat has taken measures to remove all obstructions in the beginning part of the 
Varattar that connects with Aadi Pamba. This connecting point of Varattar with Aadi Pamba is a 
crucial place to ensure the water flow of Varattar from Aadi Pamba. The major efforts of river 
rejuvenation process of Eraviperoor grama panchayat havebeen executed in this area. The river 
started flowing through its forgotten path once the path was almost cleared by the abundant 
monsoon rain. The boat race has been conducted in the river Aadi Pamba with the initiatives of 
grama panachayat. This was a true festival for the people and they had celebrated immensely. 
 
 
 47 
 
 
 
But Varattar has dried up now due to the scorching summer. Water flow can be seen only in a 
few places of the river. Sand wall and other types of blockages have been restricting the natural 
flow of Varattar. It is expected that the water flow will be restored after the monsoon. According 
to the Panchayat, more actionisneeded again to revive the river with the participation of nearest 
local governments. The present condition of Varattar is a dried river as shown below.

(Photo is taken during our field visit) 
 
 
4.2.2 Food security 
Eraviperoor panchayat introduced a scheme for paddy cultivation with an aim to achieve self-
sufficiency in rice production. The panchayat has identified 40-hectare fallow lands and has 
taken from the owners on the basis of lease and handed over to the farmers for the cultivation. 
An agreement has been executed by the panchayat with landowners. Seed, fertilisers and other 
infrastructures have been provided by the panchayat in association with Krishi Bhavan. 
Panchayat has created irrigation facilities for the paddy cultivation in the fallow land using 
MGNREGS workers. A fifteen-member Kudumbasree entrepreneur group named as 
‘Swadesabhimani’ procure paddy from the farmers at the support price fixed by the government 
with the fostering of the panchayat. After processing, the rice is packed in 5 kg and 10 kg cloth 
bags and soldto the needy people in the brand name of ‘Eraviperoor Rice’. A cloth bag unit is 
also functioning with the financial support of the panchayat. The subsidies for the procurement 
and marketing have been provided by the panchayat with the help of Kudumbasree Mission in 
the initial time. It is reported that Kudumbasree unit has now become profitable, and they are 
actively engaged in procurement, processing and marketing. The Kudumbasree members 
reported that panchayat is monitoring the functions of the unit and providing all kinds of 
necessary supports. In the absence of rice processing mill in the panchayat area, they depend on 
the nearest district for the paddy processing. Therefore panchayat is planning to establish their 
own rice processing mill with modern facilities, and it is expected to reducethe production cost 
of Eraviperoor Rice. 
 
4.2.3 Environment 
Eraviperoor grama panchayat has organised a special grama sabha- ‗Eco-grama sabha‘- in all the 
wards for environment conservation. It was the best method to spread environment awareness to 
the people. All suggestions emerged from the grama sabha have been recorded and formulated in 
an action plan based on it. Waste management is one of the important activities of the panchayat. 
A plastic shredding unit has been functioning in the panchayat, and it is also providing 
employment to a few women. Plastic waste is being collected from the houses and institutions 
every month by KudumbasreeHarithakarmaSena at the rate of Rs.30/- per household. These 
plastics are dumped into the plastic shredding unit for the processing. After shredding process, 
the plastics are handed over for the use of road tarring. It is reported that people from 
 
 48 
 
 
 
outsidethepanchayat area are also collecting these processed plastics for road tarring 
purpose,therebygeneratinga reasonable income. Panchayat officials have reported that the 
maintenance cost of the road can be reduced through the promotion of plastic tarring roads. As 
per the records, 6714.5 kg plastics havebeen collected during the period from 2012-13 to 2017-
18, out of it 5284 kg was used for road tarring and generated Rs.60650/- as income.15 A scheme 
for construction of compost pits in all households is also introduced for the processing of organic 
waste. 
 
Varieties of trees have been planted in the panchayat area through the afforestation activity by 
utilising MGNREGS labourers. Medicinal plants are also planted in the premises of Family 
Health Centre. The QR code has been created for each plant and placed in it to get all 
information related to each plant. Lakhs of Areca nut tree have been planted in Aadipamba –
Varattar area. Panchayat has released all encroachments in this area and planted Areca nut tree 
with the aim of getting Areca nut leaves (paala- local name) for the famous Hindu cultural 
festival ‗padayani‘. Arecanut tree and its leaves- paala is an important item for the Padayani 
festival. Planting trees and medicinal plants and its conservation is an important activity of the 
panchayat in keeping with environment protection which is monitored by the BMC. The 
President of the panchayat said that littering waste and chopping trees are punishable in the 
panchayat area. A camera has been installed in important places, and panchayat will impose fine 
as per the recommendations of BMC.  
 
Reducing street light billing to zero is another mission of BMC by fixing solar panels over 
panchayat and transferred offices. BMC reported that an effort had been taken to digitalise the 
PBR. BMC is planning to collect biodiversity data once again for the digitalisation. Along with 
this carbon-neutral study is ongoing now. The survey has been conducted in some wards of the 
panchayat to get the information related to the volume of carbon emission from each household 
and institution. A special grama sabha for carbon-neutral has been organised. The panchayat 
aims to become carbon-neutral village in 2020-21 by planting trees, reducing plastics and all 
type of pollutions.  
 
4.3 Meenangadi Grama Panchayat- Creation of an artificial forest and becoming the 
 first carbon-neutral panchayat in India

and having 19 wards and 8199 families. According to the Census 2011, the total population of 
the Panchayat is 33450. The average rainfall is 221 mm16. The major occupation of the people is 
agriculture and livestock rearing. The total agriculture area is 4919 ha., and major crops 
cultivated in the area are paddy, coffee, pepper, plantains, coconut, rubber, areca nut, ginger, 
turmeric, tapioca, elephant foot yam, great yam, taro root etc. The Panchayat is prosperous with 
four rivers i.e., Nurasipuzha, Purakkadipuzha, Chundalipuzha,Kuttirayinpuzha and 23 streams. 
The forest area is 2.7 percent of the total area of the Panchayat. A lot of public institutions are 
functioning in the Panchayat area. The public infrastructure comprising road connectivity, 
drinking water, electricity is also good.  Besides this, the National Highway NH 766 (212), and 
State Highway pass through the panchayat area.  
 
BMC 
BMC of Meenagadi GP was formed in 2008. This is one of the first GPs in Wayanad who 
prepared People‘s Biodiversity Register (PBR). BMC was reconstituted on 14/11/2016. The 
Panchayat has appointed an active environmentalist Shri.Pavithran Master who is a retired 
government School headmaster, as the convenor of BMC. BMC has been functioning very 
activelyand an Action Plan for environment conservation has been formulated since then. BMC 
is actively involved in the environment preservation activities apart from the preparation of PBR, 
which include conducting carbon-neutral study, the formation of Manikavu Bamboo Park, 
conducting biodiversity study- Kolagappara, Kavukal, seed bank, School level club activities, 
PBR updation etc. The immense support from active NGOs like MSSRF has been noted as 
crucial in the activities of BMC.  
 
In 2018 Meenangadi won the best BMC award from the State Biodiversity Board and received a 
special mention from the National Biodiversity Authority. The BMC is functioning 
systematically in Meenangadi GP. The BMC meetings are organise every three months and 
minutes are maintained in the office. A separate office room is provided for the functions of 
BMC. The Rapid Assessment of Biodiversity loss due to floods and landslides has been 
completed with the support of MSSRF recently.  
4.3.1 Activities of BMC 
Carbon-Neutral Panchayat-More actions have been taken by Meenangadi with the aim of 
becoming India‘s first carbon-neutral panchayat. Carbon emission was estimated from 
transportation, energy, waste, Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU). Meenangadi 
has conducted a waste audit and energy audit in households and institutions to measure the 
quantities of waste generation and energy emissions. Similarly, the emission from transportation 
has also been calculated. The carbon-neutral study has been conducted with the support of 
experts and NGO-Thanal-. Further actions have been coordinated by BMC with the frequent 
consultation with eminent experts, IIT researchers, experts from leading universities etc. based 
on the recommendations of the study. The efforts of Meenangadi are valuable and effectual in 
the context of Wayanad,whichis one of the districts in the state that are labelled climate change 
hotspots. 
 
Punyavanam – It is an artificial forest engendered by BMC in 44 acres of land. It has been 
conservedasa forest with the support of MSSRF, Social forestry and MGNREGS since 2005. 
MSSRF was the key player from 2005; later the panchayat and BMC have been involved 
actively from 2012 to create an artificial forest with the support of MGNREGS and social

forestry. Trees belong to 115 species of the Western Ghats region have been planted in 
Punyavanam, and now it became a forest having varieties of trees, birds and animals.  
 
Pathirippara-Conservation and studies about biodiversity-A study has been conducted on the 
biodiversity system in Pathirippara under the monitoring of BMC with the support of MSSRF. 
The floristic study conducted by MSSRF, documented a total number of 142 taxa of flowering 
plants belonging to 123 genera and 54 families from this area. Dicotyledons dominate with 123 
Species belonging to 108 genera 45 families constitute 86.6 percent of total flora and 
monocotyledons have 19 species 15 genera from 8 families constitute 13.4 percent of floristic 
richness in this rocky area17. This area has been conserving and protecting from rock mining and 
unauthorised human interventions. The panchayat is planning to explore this area for an eco-
tourism point. 
 
Protection of Kaavu and Keni- BMC conducted studies on 48 Kaavu and traditional Keni 
protecting by tribes. Protection of 48 Kaavu and promotion of traditional knowledge sharing is 
one of the major activities of BMC.  
Traditional Keni (small water well constructed by tribes having crystal clear water) is an 
important water source of tribes, and they are considering this as holy water. A day of tribe 
family starts with this holy water, and it has natural and cultural importance. The water level of 
these Kenis will not change even in the drought situation. 
 
Conversion of Barren land into cultivable land-Panchayat has identified acres of barren land after 
cutting teak which was distributed by the government to the tribes for their housing and 
livelihood in accordance with the Forest Right Act. This area was completely barren and 
isolated; nothing can be cultivated. The panchayat has taken a mission to implement livelihood 
agricultural project i.e., Agro root and Agro veg in this area. Tribes were not interested in living 
in this area because of the isolation and uncultivable barren land. Panchayat implemented Agro 
root project(supplying various kinds of tubers seeds for cultivation) with the labour support from 
MGNREGS. Tribes of this area are also included in the MGNREGS scheme so that they had 
cultivated in their own land with the government wage. This kind of support of panchayat 
created motivation for cultivation and attracted tribes to live there. Similarly,Agro veg project 
(supplying various kinds of vegetable seeds for cultivation)wasimplemented. Apart from this, 
various kinds of trees have been planted through afforestation activities in this area. There was 
no well water in earlier times. Six water wells are functioning now in this area after creating rain 
pits and greenery. Tribes are cultivating various kinds of vegetables and tubers and rearing live 
stocks in this area for their needs and selling purpose. Now the area can be seen as a normal 
greenery living place with the fabulous and exemplary attempts of panchayat and BMC. 
 
Community Seed Bank-The measures have been taken for the conservation and extension of 
traditional varieties of crops especially paddy, pepper and tubers. The panchayat has identified 
farmers who have been cultivating the traditional crops and created a directory of farmers. The 
technical assistance, awareness, public recognition, seed fest, subsidies for cultivation etc. have 
been provided for them.  
 
Attakkolli Biodiversity park-Conservation of screw pine plants and bamboo in the banks of the 
pond was a major activity of BMC. Screwpine has an exceptional capacity for the protection of 
the banks of rivers and canals from erosion. Its fibrous root system also helps in keeping the

alluvial soil intact and maintaining the water-holding capacity of the soil. Premises of pond are 
beautifully maintained as a park with a tiled walkway and flowering plants. 
 
Biodiversity clubs –BMC has formulated biodiversity clubs in the government, aided and un- 
aided schools. This is creating environmental awareness among the students. 
 
Biodiversity Bamboo Park at Manikavu -All varieties of bamboos in the Western Ghats area will 
be protected in this park. 
 
Other activities 
BMC is conducting Biodiversity awareness campaigns frequently. Planting and conserving 
medicinal plants in the premises of the Ayurveda hospital and school garden is another activity 
of BMC. BMC has identified premises of school land for planting various species of plants by 
utilising the labour force of MGNREGS. A bamboo park consisting of various types of bamboo 
in a school has been designed and planted by BMC,whichis a more attractive one and creates 
eco-friendly educational atmosphere. Planting highly Rare, Endangered and Threatened (RET) 
endemic plants of 45 species in the PurakkadiDevaswam land with the support of MSSRF 
(highly RET garden in four acres of land) is another project of BMC. It aims at all endemic 
highly RET species in the Western Ghats area of Wayanad which can meet at a single place. It is 
reported that an agreement has to be executed with the Devaswam Board to use their land for the 
planting of RET species. Discussions are ongoing to implement this project soon. 
 
For protecting eco system BMC is actively involved in the conservation of traditional natural 
resources as mentioned above. BMC conducted studies on 48 Kaavu protecting by tribes, 
traditional Keni (small water well constructed by tribes), Pathirippara etc., Preservation of 
AttakkollyJaiva Park, Maalikavu Bamboo Park, creation of artificial forest, conserving RET 
garden are the major activities of BMC taking into account of the protection of natural resources. 
A plastic shredding unit has been constructed toestablishaneco-friendly waste management 
system. The panchayat is promoting door to door collection of plastic waste every two weeks in 
a month with the help of KudumbasreeHarithakarma Sena members. This waste is dumped into 
the shredding unit for further processing. The pipe compost units are also be given to the houses 
for biodegradable waste processing.  
 
PBR 
The PBR was prepared in 2012 as per the instructions of KSBB. The survey team had been 
formulated for each ward of the panchayat. Each team had 10 people comprising of experts, 
teachers, students and ward members. All data of biological resources have been collected and 
recorded. Training and supports, technical advice and financial assistance from the State 
Biodiversity Board have been utilised. As per the PBR,Meenangadi has 156 types of agricultural 
crops in cultivation including 71 types of paddy, 20 types of vegetables, 23 types of tubers, 41 
types of cash crops and one type of Ragi. Considering the fruit crops, 52 types were cultivated. 
A lot of wild plants had been identified which included 88 types of wild medicinal plants. The 
total number of floral species was recorded as 572.  The total number of faunal species was 327, 
which included 272 wild animals. 
 
Paddy, various tubers, vegetables, ragi, plantains, mango tree, jackfruit, lemon, etc., have been 
identified as the agro biological resources in the panchayat area. Meenangadi GP introduced the 
seed bank programme to protect these resources by providing technical assistance, awareness 
programmes, public recognition, seed fest etc., to the identified farmers to cultivate the 
traditional crops. Organic vegetable cultivation is being promoted by the GP. It is ongoing in 67 
 
 52 
 
 
 
acres of land. These organic cultivated vegetables are sold through Kudumbasree fest, Onam 
fest, Vishu fest etc., and through the selling outlet run by Kudumbasree. 
 
The PBR was prepared seven years back. It is reported that the data is almost collected again for 
the updation of PBR. An NGO has been identified by the panchayat to digitalise the PBR and the 
advance amount of money has been transferred already. BMC reported that it has been 
informedfrom the State Biodiversity Board that the digitalisation process has to be ensured by 
using the official software. But the software of Bio-Diversity Board is in developing stage only. 
Therefore the updation of PBR is pending. 
 
From the field level evaluation of BMC of Meenangadi grama panchayat, it is observed that 
there is no separate fund for the programmes of BMC. Such paucity of funds of 
BMCwasovercomeby the panchayat through its splendid efforts of discerning allocation 
strategy. Some of the projectsimplemented by the panchayat are directly or indirectly related to 
the environmental assets. The panchayatis able to allocate enough fundsin the budget to 
implement such projects. Panchayat officials reported that consultation with BMC members has 
been ensured in the process of implementation of projects which are directly or indirectly related 
to environmental assets. Therefore such projects can be implemented in accordance with the 
action plan of BMC. Effective use of MGNREGS and coordination of other schemes are the key 
factors of the success of Meenangadi. Moreover, measures of Meenangadito become India‘s first 
carbon-neutral panchayat are the exemplary efforts and valuable in the context of biodiversity 
conservation.

Profile:Marancherry grama panchayat is located at Perumbadappu block panchayat of 
Malappuram district. The total geographical area of the panchayat is 20.47 sq.kms, and the total 
population is 35360 persons across its 19 wards 18 . Marancherry is nearest of Ponnani 
Municipality and Veliyamcodu, Edappal grama panchayats and bounded with rivers, canals and 
Biyyam Lake. The majority of people depend on agriculture. Coconut is the major crop in 
cultivation. A large number of water bodies, canals, and small water streams are flowing through 
Marancherry village.

BMC 
BMC was initially constituted in 2011 as per the government order. But it was not active until 
2015. The BMC has embarked on its activities after its reconstitution in 2015. BMC has been 
conducting meetings every three months, and the minutes of the meetings are recorded properly. 
An Action Plan has been formulated for the activities of BMC which includes water 
conservation, mangrove conservation, wetland conservation, creation of Nakshathravanam (Star 
Forest) project etc. Guidance and training from State Bio-Diversity Board has triggered the 
smooth functioning of BMC. It is reported that the grama panchayat allocated one lakh rupees 
for preparing PBR. SBB sanctioned an amount of Rs.4.5 lakhs considering it as a model BMC, 
for further activities, mainly for the creation of Nakshathravanam (Star Forest). In the 
furtherance of creating environmental awareness, BMC had conducted an exhibition cum 
symposium. In 2019, Marancherry has been selected for the best BMC award of Kerala State 
Biodiversity Board. 
 
4.4.1 Activities of BMC 
a) Water conservation 
A lot of water bodies like canals, streams (thodu), ponds, rivers, and Biyyam lake is 
flowing through the panchayat area. Protection of these water bodies is one of the major 
activities of the panchayat. It is reported that 7.2 kms of new streams/thodu has been 
constructed and more than 15 kms of old streams have been rejuvenated. New ponds 
have been constructed in the private lands as per the needs of the farmers/individuals 
under MGNREGS scheme. It will also be amplified groundwater recharging. Cleaning of 
water bodies, construction of sidewall, paving geotextiles, are also implemented through 
this scheme. The panchayat has taken initiatives for planting bamboos in the river and 
canal sides through MGNREGS under the monitoring of BMC to prevent soil erosion.  
 
b) Mangrove and Bamboo planting/conservation 
Natural mangrove forest can be seen in some areas of the panchayat. The panchayat has 
taken measures to conserve these mangroves and replanting new mangroves in the river 
and lakesides. BMC officials reported that more than thousand new mangroves have 
been planted in the lakesides by the applying labour force of MGNREGS. Moreover, 
various kinds of bamboo have been planted in the river and canal sides.

c) Plastic processing unit 
A plastic processing unit has been functioning in the panchayat area. This unit is 
managing by the panchayat to ensure eco-friendly waste management system. This unit 
is also providing employment to a few people and the wages met by the panchayat. 
Plastic waste is being collected from the houses and institutions every month by 
KudumbasreeHarithakarmaSena at the rate of Rs.30/- per household. These plastics are 
dumped into the plastic processing unit. After sorting, the plastics carry bags are put into 
 
 54 
 
 
 
the processing machine for liquefying by electric heating. The liquid form of plastics will 
be turned into dry pieces which are sold to private companies for the manufacturing of 
tarpaulin sheets and other value-added products. Panchayat officials reported that plastics 
from nearest local governments are being brought to this unit for processing. It is 
reported that the environment pollution clearance has been accredited already by the 
Pollution Control Board. With regard to biodegradable waste processing, biogas and pipe 
compost units are also being promoted. 
 
d) Biodiversity documentation 
MarancherryKole wetland is one of the key biodiversity areas which has been identified 
by the State Biodiversity Board.  The Kole wetlands are low lying fields located 0.5 to 
1m below Mean Sea Level. The Kole Wetlands is one of largest, highly productive and 
threatened wetlands in Kerala. The Kole lands are faunal rich and support a large number 
of birds including endangered and migratory birds. It also provides services such as flood 
control, groundwater recharge, and acts as a carbon sink. 
 
The biodiversity in MarancherryKole wetland has been documented with the astonishing 
support of panchayat. The biodiversity richness of Kole wetland has been documented 
systematically which includes 144 floral species, 21 species of mammals, 14 species of 
reptiles, 06 species of amphibians, and 244 species of birds. This was a remarkable effort 
of the panchayat for the conservation of Kole wetland area.  
 
e) Exhibition cum symposium 
An exhibition cum symposium had been conducted to generate environmental awareness 
among the public. Many experts, teachers, stakeholders, NGOs,etc., had participated in 
the symposium.  
 
f) Promotion of paddy cultivation /endemic species of tubers  
Panchayat officials reported that a project for promoting paddy cultivation in 5 acres of 
land had been implemented with the support of Youth Clubs. It is expected to create a 
passion for paddy cultivation among the youths. All other supports, i.e., seeds, fertilisers, 
subsidies, etc., have been supplied to the farmers. Furthermore, endemic species of tubers 
have been identified, and its seeds have also been supplied to the individuals for the 
promotion of endemic tuber production. 
g) Nakshathravanam 
Nakshathravanam (Star Forest) project aims at planting trees based on the birth star of 
the people. Each birth star has its own tree as envisioned in the concept of Hindu religion 
and belief. State Biodiversity Board sanctioned Rs. 4.5 lakhs for the creation of 
Nakshathravanam. The panchayat is planning to create Nakshathravanamnear to the 
public crematorium.  
 
PBR 
Marancherry faced delay in preparation of PBR because of BMC was not active in the initial 
period. The PBR was prepared in 2018 as per the instructions of State Biodiversity Board. The 
State Bio-Diversity Board has provided training, guidance and support for the preparation of 
PBR. The grama panchayat allocated one lakh rupees for preparing PBR. The survey team 
comprising of 2 people for each ward wasformulated. The support and participation of teachers, 
students and ward members was used by the survey team. It is reported that all possible 
biological resources have been documented properly because Marancherry prepared PBR very 
 
 55 
 
 
 
recently. The process of preparation of PBR has been completed within one-year. A project is 
prepared now for the digitalisation of PBR. 
 
As per the PBR, 23 varieties of food grains particularly paddy have been identified. Along with 
this, 36 varieties of vegetables, 13 tubers and 12 varieties of cash crops have also been 
identified. Forty varieties of medicinal plants, 28 varieties of wild medicinal plants, 19 items of 
livestock and pets and 25 wild fish wealth items have also been recorded in the PBR. There are 
existing 80 watersheds, including streams/thodu and ponds.  
 
As far as the conservation of RET species is concerned, panchayat is planting and protecting 
mangroves. Panchayat is implementing several schemes for protecting ecosystem like wetlands, 
mangroves and kaavu. Biodiversity Clubs are functioning well in the schools. A local survey has 
been conducted by NGOs with the monitoring of panchayat for assessing carbon emission to 
address the issues of climate change.  
 
Marancherry grama panchayat is a notable village in the case of natural resources like 
mangroves, canals, ponds, lake, rivers, Kole wetlands, kaavus etc. The panchayat is 
implementing several schemes considering its ecological importance. Most of the schemes are 
implemented through MGNREGS. Activities of MGNREGS based on the environment assets 
generally come under the purview of BMC. The convenor of BMC is very active in monitoring 
all the activities which have natural importance. Therefore, it can be projected as the activities of 
BMC for the protection of the environment. On the basis of such tasks of BMC which includes 
conservation of traditional water bodies, creation of new ponds and streams, biodiversity 
documentation of Kole wetland, planting bamboos and mangroves in the canal and lakeside, eco-
friendly waste management system, symposiums for environmental awareness building etc., 
Marancherry has been awarded by the State Biodiversity Board as the best BMC in 2019.

 PBR is prepared in all selected grama panchayats. Eraviperoor and Kanjikkuzhi prepared 
PBR in 2011, Meenangadi in 2012 and Marancherry prepared in 2018. 
 The way of preparation of PBR was more or less similar in all selected panchayats in 
reliance on the guidance of the State Biodiversity Board. 
 The updation and digitalisation of PBR is thenext task of all BMCs. The initial works 
already started.  
 All grama panchayats are keeping minutes of the meeting of BMC except Kanjikuzhi. 
 BMCs in all selected panchayats have been reconstituted once.  
 Separate office room for BMC has been seen in Meenangadigramapanchayat only. 
 Plastic shredding units are functioning in all selected panchayats except Kanjikuzhi for 
ensuring eco-friendly waste management system. In Kanjikuzhi, Harithakeralam Mission 
collects plastic waste for recycling purpose. 
 Normally there is no separate fund for the Action Plans of BMC except special funds 
from State Biodiversity Board for model BMCs. Such paucity of funds of BMC was 
overcomeby the panchayats by integrating selected conventional projects of panchayats 
which are directly or indirectly related to environment assets into the Action Plan of 
BMC.  
 Effective use of MGNREGS is a pivotal factor for the best performance in the selected 
four grama panchayats. Majority of the heads under MGNREGS like afforestation, water 
conservation, drought proofing, and renovation of water bodies etc., which are direct 
benefits to the environment conservation. Therefore, MGNREGS can be considered as a 
scheme which contributes to the environment protection at the local level along with the 
employment generation. These grama panchayats ensure the monitoring of BMCs in the 
implementation of such projects. In other words, the majority of the activities of BMCs in 
accordance with the Action Plan have been implemented through MGNREGS. 
 Effective integration of various schemes, i.e., schemes of transferred institutions like 
Krishibhavan, departmental schemes, centrally sponsored schemes (MGNREGS), etc., 
have been brought out in line with the plan formulation in selected panchayats. For 
instance, an attempt has been made by these panchayats to enhance the paddy cultivation 
was by using labour force of MGNREGS and seeds, fertilisers and other supports from 
Krishibhavan. 
 Measures of Meenangadito become India‘s first carbon-neutral panchayat and creation of 
artificial forest, efforts of Eraviperoor in the rejuvenation of Varattar river, conducting 
Eco-Gramasabha and promoting Eraviperoor Rice, attempts of Marancherry in the 
conservation Kole wetland have been observed as exemplary steps in the context of 
biodiversity conservation. 
 Kanjikuzhi grama panchayat is renowned for the vegetable cultivation and it has been 
observed as a life culture of the people of Kanjikuzhi. Providing seeds and all other 
supports to promote vegetable cultivation in all households, identifying barren land to 
cultivate vegetables by using MGNREGS labourers under the monitoring of panchayat, 
maintaining vegetable shops to promote marketing, are the major activities of Kanjikuzhi 
grama panchayat in this context. The attempt of Kanjhikuzhi grama panchayat to promote 
vegetable cultivation can be considered as a unique in the context of agrobiodiversity 
promotion. 
 Role of NGOs, stakeholders, activists, etc., is very crucial and inevitable for local 
development, particularly in environment conservation. Active involvement of such 
groups was significant in selected grama panchayats, and it was the back born for the best 
performance of these panchayats.  
 
 57 
 
 
 
 An approach of grama panchayats to identify NGOs, stakeholders etc., in connection with 
the particular focussed area and to make a platform to involve them can be considered as 
a foremost step in the development process. It has been witnessed in selected grama 
panchayats.  
 Political coordination in the development of grama panchayat has been noticed as a vital 
factor for the best performance. 
5. Potential areas for further research 
The study has thrown up a number of possible areas for further inquiry and research. All these 
are important from the public policy point of view.  
Role of Local Self Government Units in promoting agrobiodiversity in their panchayat: 
The current mode is through the formation of Biodiversity Management Committees and the 
documentation of biodiversity at a particular point in time through the preparation of People‘s 
Biodiversity Registers (PBRs). During our field research in four model panchayats we found that 
this was not working at all. Most of the BMCs have been dysfunctional, and PBRs once framed 
are never updated.  It must be digitised an annual auditing by an accredited agency should be 
encouraged. It is important that the state government put in place some financial incentive 
schemes for proper functioning of the BMCs. The proposed research should focus on the type 
and size of this financial incentive scheme.  
In this context, although the government has constituted a 13th working group on environment, 
biodiversity and climate change with BMC as members, their role has remained merely  
advisory and so far  no funds have been allocated to them as well.  
 
Role of Government Research Institutes in developing knowledge for mainstreaming 
agrobiodiversity: There are a number of public research institutes in the state focusing on 
agrobiodiversity.  However, they have been functioning in a vacuum, often doing research 
without any coordination with the Biodiversity Board. This coordination could be achieved by 
linking these institutes to the Kerala State Biodiversity Board so that an annual research plan be 
made and a consortium be formed to develop the requisite knowledge.   
Strengthening the role of the Kerala State Biodiversity Board specifically in the area of 
agrobiodiversity: The board has to be strengthened both financially and in terms of human 
resource so that it can play its coordinating role much more effectively than now. The precise 
ways in which the board may be strengthened will form the focus of this research. The working 
relations of KSBB with all the institutions in the state working on agriculture is to be 
strengthened. The role of KSBB at the district level requires special attention.  
Assessing the fiscal support for agrobiodiversity management: Of the total budget allocation 
for agriculture only a miniscule amount is allocated fir agrobiodiversity management. A higher 
allocation is to be made after making a detailed study of the budgetary requirements.  
Role of NGOs/CSOS in the diffusion of knowledge on agrobiodiversity: Since NGOs work 
with local communities, they can build effective bridges between GRIs and local self-
governments. The research here should focus on these specific ways in which this bridge-
building can be effected.  
Documenting success stories from Panchayats and BMCs: There are a limited number of 
panchayats that have been very successful. However, each of these has adopted a different 
 
 58 
 
 
 
strategy for maintaining agrobiodiversity. Some have taken to vegetable cultivation and linked it 
with livelihoods; others have been focusing on the planting of different species of trees while 
still others have been improving waterbodies and thereby the supply of water for irrigation. 
These stories need to be written up so that other panchayats which are laggards can learn from 
the successful ones.  
Role of IPRs in promoting agrobiodiversity: A number of IPRs such as GI and Plant Varieties 
have been issued recently. It can have two possible effects. For instance, by having different 
varieties of rice (for instance, having a GI for Navara rice may enthuse farmers to have it 
cultivated) will certainly contribute to the maintenance of agrobiodiversity.  On the contrary, 
having a GI tag can also result in monocropping  
Impact of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) on agrobiodiversity:There are about 9 FTAsthat 
are in force, and threemore are in various stages of negotiation. One of the impacts of these freer 
imports of agricultural goodscan have a deleterious effect on agricultural crops and thereby on 
agrobiodiversity. However, it is also possible that such freer imports can also affect certain 
monocrops more adversely that in its place a more diverse vegetation can spring up. The area 
under most of the monocrops has shown a steady decline.  
The extent to which the BD Act in the state meet the National Biodiversity Action Plan and 
the National Biodiversity Targets (NBTs); This is an area which requires constant monitoring 
and mid-course correction. The KSBB may be equipped to carry out this annual monitoring. It is 
a kind of action research that we are suggesting.  
Identification of major physical threats to agrobiodiversity: It is generally recognised that 
invasive species is one of the major threats. A regulatory mechanism for controlling the 
introduction of invasive species as exotic flora and fauna needs to be deigned. 
Impact of climate change on agrobiodiversity: Extreme weather event such as severe floods 
and drought are now occurring, unfortunately rather regularly leading to a deleterious effect on 
agrobiodiversity. A study on possible ways ameliorating the negative effects of these extreme 
weather events is essential.  
6. Conclusions 
It looks that there is an awareness of the importance of protecting agrobiodiversity at the state 
level and also among a number of non-governmental and civil society stakeholders. However 
none of the LSGs that we studied had any intimate knowledge of NBAP and NBTs. The state 
has also put in place a number of legal and policy instruments aimed at protecting biodiversity in 
general (which include agrobiodiversity too). There is also an organisational mechanism (Kerala 
State Biodiversity Board) to steer the agenda in this regard. The research institutes are by and 
large aware of the impact of their actions on biodiversity. A significant share of local 
governments has completed the formal requirement of preparing PBR as advocated by the 
KSBB. A few of them consider the conservation of local biodiversity as an important agenda and 
take different steps in this direction.  
The other important aspect in Kerala is that a more-diverse cropping system seems to be 
economically attractive compared to a less-diverse or mono-cropping system. This could be due 
to agro-climatic and economic conditions. The latter include the need for more labour for 
monocropping systems, which makes it less attractive in Kerala where the cost of labour is 
higher, and where there are possibilities of nurturing profitable multi-crop systems. This gives 
certain economic incentives to the farmers and land-owners to sustain a relatively diverse 
farming system, which in turn helps the conservation of agrobiodiversity.  
 
 59 
 
 
 
However, there are a number of limitations or challenges too. These include: 
Though there are legal and policy instruments, there is not enough clarity on the mobilization of 
resources and mechanisms for their enforcement. Hence, some of these legal/policy provisions 
remain as wish statements. One can interpret this as an outcome of a situation where there is an 
awareness on the need to protect agrobiodiversity at the state level, but that is not translating into 
workable strategies for its protection due to other constraints of the state government.  
To some extent, this is true with regard to the Kerala State Biodiversity Board too. On paper, it 
has a number of responsibilities and if these are undertaken, can go a long way in protecting the 
biodiversity. However, it does not have adequate financial resources and authority for this 
purpose. 
Kerala is yet to put in place a system of auditing all policies which can have potential negative 
impacts on agrobiodiversity. These include the policies and programmes for the promotion of 
agriculture and plantation crops in general. However growth in area of most of the plantation 
crops in the state has been limited by adverse market conditions.  
Though PBR is the main instrument and a major share of local governments has prepared it, it is 
seen as more of a task to be completed at a point of time. It is not seen as a basis for building up 
agro-biodiversity by most local governments. This may be seen as an outcome of a top-down 
approach towards conservation where the awareness at the state level has not translated to the 
level of local governments and communities.  
It can be seen that the use of PBR and other actions for the purpose of protecting agro-
biodiversity are notable in the case of certain local governments. The role of one or a few people 
is crucial in this regard. This shows that the success of the local-level collective action requires 
the presence of a few well-informed and active individuals. This is not unusual considering the 
status of collective action which is taken to address the market failure in other domains too in 
countries such as ours.  
It looks that there is an awareness of the importance of protecting agrobiodiversity at the state 
level and also among a number of non-governmental and civil society stakeholders. The state 
has also put in place a number of legal and policy instruments aimed at protecting biodiversity in 
general (which include agrobiodiversity too). There is also an organisational mechanism (Kerala 
State Biodiversity Board) to steer the agenda in this regard. The research institutes are by and 
large aware of the impact of their actions on biodiversity.A significant share of local 
governments has completed the formal requirement of preparing PBR as advocated by the 
KSBB. A few of them consider the conservation of local biodiversity as an important agenda and 
take different steps in this direction.
