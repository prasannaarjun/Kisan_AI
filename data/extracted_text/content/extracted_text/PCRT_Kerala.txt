Foreword 
 
Climate change has emerged as a formidable challenge, particularly for the agrarian 
communities in the developing world, jeopardizing their livelihoods and food security. In 
response to this pressing issue, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has taken 
a commendable stride by launching the National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture 
(NICRA) program. This comprehensive initiative seeks to address the diverse facets of climate 
change and its impacts on agriculture, aiming to fortify the adaptive capacities of farmers across 
the nation. A pivotal component of NICRA is the Technology Demonstration, an initiative 
demonstrating location-specific, proven technologies developed by the National Agricultural 
Research System (NARS). Implemented in 446 villages across 151 climatically vulnerable 
districts, this participatory approach engages farmers directly, fostering resilience and adaptive 
capabilities. The success of this endeavour is not only enhancing the livelihoods of farmers but 
also showcasing a replicable model for adoption in other regions of the country. 
The State of Kerala, confronting the challenges of flood, dry spells have been an active 
participant in the NICRA program. In six districts, a focused effort has been made to identify 
and demonstrate proven technologies that mitigate the impacts of dry spells and floods during 
stress years and enhance agricultural production and profitability during normal years. 
Mitigating the impact of climate change on agriculture in Kerala requires the implementation 
of sustainable practices, crop diversification, and the integration of climate-resilient 
technologies. A comprehensive strategy, combining government initiatives with community-
led efforts, is essential to protect the state's agricultural sector and ensure food security for its 
inhabitants. This book showcases various improved crop production, natural resource 
management, livestock production technologies, and institutional interventions. The detailed 
documentation of these demonstrated technologies is presented in this book. This publication 
serves as a repository, documenting technologies that hold the potential for upscaling in similar 
farming situations and resource endowments. A critical aspect of this initiative is the provision 
of institutional support through the establishment of custom hiring centers, seed and fodder 
production systems. These measures aim to facilitate the widespread adoption of proven 
technologies in NICRA villages, ensuring the sustained resilience of farming communities. By 
disseminating these innovations, we not only empower farmers but also contribute to the 
overarching goal of climate-resilient agriculture. 
I compliment the authors for their exceptional contribution in bringing out this book.

PREFACE
In the face of escalating climate change challenges, the quest for viable solutions has never 
been more urgent. “Promising Climate Resilient Technologies for Kerala” embarks on 
a journey into the realm of innovative technologies, exploring a spectrum of tools and 
strategies tailored to fortify Kerala against the impacts of a changing climate. Kerala, with 
its diverse ecosystems and susceptibility to climate-related events, is at the forefront of the 
battle for resilience. This book is an exploration into the promising technologies that can 
be harnessed to safeguard communities, ecosystems, and economies against the escalating 
threats posed by climate change.
The aim is to offer a comprehensive resource for policymakers, scientists, technologists, and 
concerned citizens. Each chapter within this volume is crafted to unravel the complexities 
of climate change, elucidate the unique challenges faced by Kerala, and present cutting-
edge technologies that hold the promise of building resilience and fostering sustainable 
development. The narrative unfolds by setting the stage with an overview of the current 
climate scenario, emphasizing the need for immediate action. From there, we delve into 
a myriad of climate-resilient technologies, ranging from sustainable agriculture practices 
and water management systems to renewable energy solutions and smart urban planning
One of the guiding principles of this exploration is the understanding that no single solution 
fits all. The book underscores the importance of an integrated approach, where technology, 
community engagement, and policy frameworks converge to create a resilient and adaptable 
Kerala. Moreover, the ethical considerations, socioeconomic implications, and the role of 
community participation are examined to ensure a holistic understanding of the proposed 
solutions. This book not only serves as a guide for stakeholders in Kerala but also inspires 
a broader dialogue on climate change adaptation. Together, let us embark on a journey 
towards a more resilient and sustainable future for Kerala and beyond.
We would like to express our sincere gratitude for the continuous guidance and support 
provided by Dr. Himanshu Pathak, Secretary (DARE) & Director General (ICAR), as well 
as the members of the High-Level Monitoring Committee, Chairmen and members of Zonal 
Monitoring Committees, and Directors of Extension at State Agricultural and Veterinary 
Universities. Our appreciation extends to the officials of Development Departments and 
KVKs of the state. We also want to acknowledge with gratitude the significant contributions 
made by farmers, members of VCRMC, and other stakeholders involved in the project.

1. Introduction
Kerala is a tiny strip of land, located in the SouthWestern tip of India between North 
latitudes 8° 18’and 12° 48’ and East longitudes 74° 52’ and 77° 22’, occupying only 1.2 
% of India’s land area. Geographically, an elongated strip of land, cushioned between the 
Western Ghats on the East and the sandy shores of the Arabian sea along West bordered by 
Tamil Nadu to the East and Karnataka to the North. Its land area is 38,863 sq.km, stretching 
580 km in length and varying in width from 30 to 120 km (GWR, Kerala, 2022)
In  this geographical expanse, Kerala is characterized by three distinct physiographic 
regions: the Eastern Highlands, represented by the mountainous landscapes of the Western 
Ghats, the Central Midlands, featuring undulating hills and valleys intensively cultivated 
for agriculture; and the Western Lowlands, which include estuaries, backwaters, and coastal 
regions.

The Western Ghats, forming the Eastern border of the state, is a unique mountainous terrain 
housing the highest peaks at South of the Himalayas, showcasing its distinctive ecological 
attributes and socio-economic profile. In the Lowland region, numerous pristine estuarine 
systems and sub-sea-level Wetlands create a unique socioecological system.
Agriculture, occupies the major share with a net cultivated area  of 20,26,064 ha in the 
state, which accounts for approximately 52.13% of the State's total geographic area. Forests 
constitute the second-largest land use class, covering 27.83% of the state’s land.
Soil: The variation in topography, lithology, and climatic factors, including rainfall, 
temperature, and alternate wet and dry conditions from the Western coast to the high ranges 
in the East, as well as the presence of swift-flowing rivers, has led to the development of 
diverse natural vegetation and soil types in Kerala. The soils in the region can be broadly 
categorized into coastal alluvium, mixed alluvium, acid saline, kari, laterite, red, hill, black 
cotton, and forest soils, (Dept. Soil Survey and Soil Conservation, Govt. of Kerala, 2023).
Water: The state of Kerala has abundant water resources. Three tributaries of the Cauvery 
river originate in Kerala and flow Eastward. These rivers and streams, descending from 
the Western Ghats, either discharge into the backwaters along the coastal area or directly 
into the Arabian Sea. The major rivers include Valapattanam, Chaliar, Kadalundipuzha, 
5
Bharathapuzha, Chalakudy, Periyar, Pamba, Achancoil, and Kalladayar. Many of these 
rivers are navigable up to the midland region, facilitating cost-effective and reliable inland 
transportation. The backwaters, a notable and economically valuable feature of Kerala, 
comprise lakes and ocean inlets extending into Vembanad Lake, an expansive body of 
water that opens into the Arabian Sea at Cochin port. Other significant lakes include Anju, 
Thengu, Edava, Nadayaram Paravoor, Ashtamudi (Quilon), Kayamkulam, Kodungallor 
(Cranganore), and Cheruva. Canals connect these lakes and backwaters, establishing an 
uninterrupted inland water navigation system (India WRIS, 2023). The primary sources of 
irrigation in Kerala include canals, tanks, and wells. In 2017–18, the net irrigated area was 
392,000 ha, (KSCCAP, 2023).

Climate: Kerala, situated amidst mountains, valleys, evergreen forests, cascading 
waterfalls, and palm-fringed lagoons, presents a unique geographical and climatic 
landscape. Numerous rivers and rivulets traverse the countryside, flowing Westward to 
meet the Arabian Sea. Bounded by the Western Ghats on one side and the Arabian Sea on 
the other, the state experiences climatic conditions distinct from the rest of the country. 
The periodic reversal of wind systems in the adjoining Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea 
significantly influences the day-to-day weather in Kerala.
The Western Ghats play a pivotal role in shaping the weather, with the forced ascent 
of monsoon currents leading to substantial rainfall on the windward side of the region. 
Rainfall intensity depends not only on altitude but also on factors such as the strength and 
direction of the currents, slope steepness, and other terrain characteristics. Unlike many 
other parts of the country, Kerala does not undergo an extended dry period with scorching 
heat. Summer, season is from April to June, with a  maximum and  minimum temperature 
of 330c and around 200c, respectively. The temperatures are relatively mild compared to 
other Indian states. 
6
The South - West monsoon arrives in June, and ends in September. While there isn’t a distinct 
difference in climatic conditions during this transition, but humidity increases. Periods of 
continuous downpour may occur for two or three days. Notably, Vaithiri-Kuttiyadi range in 
Malabar and Peerumedu in Idukki, receive the highest rainfall during this season. Rainfall 
is comparatively lower in the Lakshadweep islands, with the Northern regions of Kerala 
experiencing around 80% rainfall, while the Southern regions receive 40-50%.
The presence of the Western Ghats acts as a barrier to the South -West monsoon, creating 
a climatic variation with abundant rainfall on the windward side and a dry belt on the 
leeward Eastern side. The North - East monsoon is between October - December.
As winter arrives, there is a slight drop in temperature, and a gentle chill is felt due to 
cold winds. Winter, is from November to January or February. Occasional light rainfall, 
accompanied by thunder and lightning, occurs in the Northern regions of the state during 
this period, with Kottayam receiving the highest rainfall in winter (Kerala state climate 
change Knowledge portal, 2023)
Agriculture and cropping pattern
The cropping pattern in Kerala is shaped by various agro climatic factors, including 
humidity, temperature, elevation, topography, vegetation, rainfall, and soil structure. The 
state is classified into five Agroecological zones and 23 Agroecological units based on 
climate, geomorphology, land use, and soil variability. Kerala predominantly consists of 
small and marginal farms, with an average holding size of 0.18 ha or 0.4 acres according 
to the Agricultural Census.
The major crops in Kerala include cereals, pulses, oilseeds, and cash crops. Rice is the 
dominant cereal crop. Various condiments and spices such as black pepper, cardamom, 
ginger, turmeric, clove, and nutmeg, plantations crops like rubber, coffee, tea, coconut, 
banana, and pineapple were also cultivated. While the area under paddy production has 
declined to one-fourth as compared to the 1980s, whereas plantation crops like rubber, 
coconut, and arecanut has increased within the gross area under production. Kerala has 
highest coconut area and  production in India (KSCCAP, 2023).
Challenges of climate change 
Cash crops , food crops including rice, tapioca, and pulses, accounts for  10.21% of the 
total cultivated area during 2015-16. In contrast, cash crops and Plantation crops (cashew, 
7
coconut, rubber, coffee, tea, pepper and cardamom) accounts for 62.8% of the total 
cultivated area.
Temperature regimes play a crucial role in influencing the growth duration, pattern, and 
productivity of rice crops. Studies on rice productivity under global warming indicate 
potential decreases in yield as the global temperature rises. Simulated results suggest a 
5-7% reduction in yield for major crops, including rice, with a 1°C increase in mean daily 
temperature.
Changes in rainfall, both in amount and distribution, are critical factors limiting rain-
fed rice yield. Variability in the onset of the rainy season contributes to variations in the 
planting season for rain-fed rice. The temperature range, specifically the difference between 
maximum and minimum temperatures, is widening in areas where thermo-sensitive crops 
like cardamom, tea, black pepper, and cocoa are cultivated along the high ranges. Climate 
change, manifested in climate variability such as floods and droughts, has adversely 
affected both food and plantation crops to a significant extent. (Kerala state climate change 
Knowledge portal, 2023).

Composting of aquatic weeds for carbon sequestration in Kuttanad 
region of Kerala
Background
Extensive accumulation and spread of aquatic weeds in the paddy fields and water bodies 
pose menace to paddy cultivation, inland navigation, fish culture and availability of pure 
drinking water in Kuttanad Wetland Ecosystem. 
Resilient technology
To address the menance of aquatic weeds, composting of aquatic weeds using Effective 
Microbial (EM) solution was taken up through technology demonstrations. The aquatic 
weeds collected from water bodies and paddy fields were heaped on the bunds or nearby 
upland area. Activated EM solution along with cow dung slurry application in different 
layers of the heaps of 20 m2 (5 x 2 x 2m) and covered by coconut fronds of waste cloths. 
The composting was completed by 45 – 60 days and recovery of  compost was 10 -15% 
of the original fresh volume. The compost could be utilized for the cultivation of banana 
and vegetables. Since these aquatic weeds are assumed to accumulate heavy metal ions 
in the biomass, the compost, different plant parts and the fruits were analysed to assess 
the presence of any of the heavy metals like Cadmium (Cd), Lead (Pb), Chromium (Cr), 
Arsenic (As) and Mercury (Hg) in the produce.
Performance and impact of technology
During the nine years from 2014 to 2022, about 2560 t of fresh aquatic weeds removed 
from 382 ha of the paddy fields (Padashekharams) and converted into 346 t of compost 
involving about 2000 farmers in three villages of Kuttanad.  The compost produced was 
effectively utilized for production of tomato, brinjal, chilly, okra, cowpea and amaranthus. 
From the nutrient analysis, it was observed that the compost contained on an average 
9.51% Organic Carbon, 0.71% Nitrogen, 0.24% Pottasium, 34.8ppm Calcium, 11.0 
ppm Magnesium and 2.05 ppm Boron. Further analytical results showed the presence of 
Cadmium, Lead, Chromium and Arsenic in the compost but not Mercury. The analysis of 
plant leaves and stem and fruits of tomato, brinjal, chilly, okra, cowpea, flowers and seeds 
of amaranthus revealed that the content of Cd, Pb, Cr, were lower than the critical limits 
in both the compost and vegetable, samples as per the maximum allowable limits of heavy 
metals in soils and vegetables that have been established by WHO, FAO and Standard 
Guidelines in Europe. Though arsenic content in compost was higher than the critical limit, 
its presence in the vegetable samples was not in the detectable range.

Scope for upscaling
With this technology, 32.9 t of organic carbon could be sequestered through microbial 
enhanced composting of aquatic weeds which are a serious menace to the cropping and 
other activities of Kuttanad region of Kerala, where below sea level farming is practiced 
owing to the geographic setting. This composting of aquatic weeds was demonstrated to 
farmers in collaboration with MGNREGS by the KVK in the  NICRA-TDC project. If 
the activity could be expanded to the 30,000 ha paddy fields spread in three districts of 
the Kuttanad region by coordinated efforts of the local self Govt. and Govt. departments, 
the weed menace could be brought in control to an extent along with sequestration of 
considerable amount of carbon.

Integrated practices in the coconut basin for enhancing the 
nut yield and soil health in coconut farm
Background 
In traditional method of coconut cultivation in Kerala, involves stypically no amendments 
addition for soil moisture conservation and lime also was not applied to correct the pH. 
Hence nutrient uptake was reduced.
Resilient technology
The application of organic amendments like husk, coirpith compost in the coconut basin 
enhances soil moisture retention in the coconut basin since a more water-absorbent and 
moisture-retentive environment is created, promoting optimal conditions for coconut 
cultivation. Cowpea as a cover crop in the coconut basin provides a ground cover and 
reduces evaporation and prevent soil erosion in addition to addressing weed competition in 
coconut basins. Moreover, cowpea contributes to soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, and 
solubilization of soil phosphorus enhancing the overall health of the coconut palm.  This 
is a complementary strategy. Application of lime in the coconut basin helps in correcting 
soil acidity. Correction of soil acidity improved the nutrient absorption and overall plant 
health as was evident from soil test results carried out by KVK in the area. These integrated 
practices ensures a holistic approach for sustainable coconut farming, addressing both 
moisture conservation and soil health.
Performance and impact of technology 
The technology was adopted in 200 coconut palms of NICRA - TDC village of Kozhikode 
district, and a comparative study was carried out between farming systems with animals 
and farming systems without animals. It is observed that in both the farming systems a 
notable increase in coconut palm yield was observed compared to traditional practices. The 
improvement in  soil water holding capacity and overall soil health played a crucial role 
in improving the crop yields. This positive outcome in coconut palms sparked significant 
interest among farmers, motivating them to adopt this technology. 
Scope for upscaling
Driven by farmers’ keen interest and the positive outcomes, the technology has been widely 
adopted by other farmers in the NICRA -TDC village. This village is located in a core 
coconut cultivation area, Hence the implementation of these practices holds the potential 
for a significant upswing in yields in the coming years in NICRA and surrounding villages.

Construction of field bunds in convergence in Chengalayi Village
Field bunds for effective management of cropped field
Background 
In Kannur, Kerala, the implementation of field bunds is imperative for effective crop 
field management owing to the region's undulating topography and high rainfall. Kannur 
faces the risk of soil erosion and nutrient loss due to its hilly terrain. Field bunds serve as 
vital protective measures, mitigating the impact of water runoff by slowing it down and 
preventing erosion.
Resilient technology
Mud field bunds were constructed in the Kundamakai Padashekharam covering more 
than 21 acres in the Chengalayi village. Construction of field bund in Kundamkai with an 
estimated amount of ₹ 454006/- and 1440 man days was carried out in convergence with 
MGNREGS.
Performance and impact of technology
The fragmented wetland holdings always cause difficulty in synchronized planting and 
cultural operations in Kerala scenario. This enhanced the active participation of existing 
farmers as well as encouraged new members to rice cultivation in Chengalayi village. The 
intervention increased the rice cultivation area from 14 acres to 21 acres compared to the

Enhancement of storage capacity of percolation ponds with organic materials and 
diversion of surface runoff rainwater for enhancing the yield of plantation crops
Background
Water shortage during second and third crop season have resulted in decline in cop 
production in Padichira village. This area receives the lowest amount of rainfall in the 
Wayanad district and hence harvesting of every drop of rainwater is quite important. Water 
scarcities especially during summers have adversely affected the plantation crops like 
pepper, coffee and arecanut.
Resilient technology
Percolation ponds with a dimension of 4 m x 2 m x 1.5 m (l x b x h) can store upto12000 l 
of water. Coconut husk lining is done  at the bottom of the tank to reduce the seepage losses 
of water and to conserve water. Construction of pond costed ₹ 2500 unit-1 including the 
labour charge. Diversion of surface runoff water from roads and construction of percolation 
ponds that store water helped to improve the water table of the area and nearby places. 
Demonstrations on enhancement of storage capacity using surface runoff rainwater through 
roads and construction of percolation ponds was administered in 20 ha area involving 10 
farmers during 2022-23. in Padichira village, Wayanad district.
Performance and impact of technology
This technology helped to increase the water table level in open wells. Adoption of 
percolation ponds and construction of channels to drain surface runoff rainwater to their 
fields resulted in lower water requirement of 2-3 irrigations as compared to 4-5 irrigations 
in conventional. The technology improved the yield (14.67%) and income (12.5%)
respectively.  (₹ 59700 ha-1 and ₹ 11896 ha-1) in pepper and arecanut field, respectively.

Composting of organic residues with a portable vermibed using bioinoculants for 
enhancing soil fertility and crop yield  
Background
Excess agricultural waste poses serious problems in its disposal by the farmers, resulting 
in deleterious impact on environment and soil fertility depletion. Sustainable conversion 
of excess and unused crop residues could allow in recover of valuable components 
as substrates and nutrients through microbial/enzymatic controlled process such as 
composting.  Sustainable use of crop residues will allow to recycle valuable components 
as substrates and nutrients.
Resilient technology
A small-scale composting plant at farm level to effectively recycle excess and unused organic 
wastes as green compost was done. This serves as valuable (rich in humidified substances) 
biofertilizer, that would improve soil fertility soil structure, water holding capacity of the 
soil, and releases nutrients slowly. A portable vermibed (capacity: 1000 kg farm waste) and 
KAU liquid microbial consortium was provided to farmers. Demonstrations on composting 
was administered in 20 ha area involving 10 farmers during 2022-23 in Padichira village 
of Wayanad district.
Performance and impact of technology
Application of compost helps to improve the soil structure, water holding capacity of the 
soil and slow release of nutrients. Compost recovery was approximately 53% and in a year, 
10 farmers produced 20 t of compost. The technology helped the farmers to achieve a yield 
improvement of 12.65%, additional income of ₹ 35750 ha-1 in banana cultivation.

Improving water holding capacity in coconut plantations for improving the 
productivity
Background
The coconut face dry spells and the productivity of palm decreases.
Resilient technology
Husk burial can be done in coconut basins or in the interspaces to overcome drought and 
button shedding. Heaping of  husks @ 100 nos. with concave surface facing upwards can 
act as sponge, absorb and retain moisture about 6-10 times respectively to their own weight 
and slowly release to the coconut trees during dry periods. As the husk or dust breaks down 
slowly, their effect will last for 4-6 yrs and 8-10 yrs respectively. On decomposition they 
also add potash to the soil. The husk can be also buried in the trenches at a distance of 3 m 
from the palm at 45 cm deep and 150 cm width in between two rows of coconut.
Performance and impact of technology
Burying coconut husks is a highly efficient method for conserving soil moisture. The 
demonstration was conducted in the three farmers’ fields in Pattithara village. In each 
farmer field, 50 palms were selected. A notable improvement, in the water use efficiency 
(0.57 to 0.71) was observed.  Additionally, there was an increase in nut yield in the fields 
where this practice was applied.

Sand bag reinforced temporary check dams based water storage to 
supplement the crop water need for higher yield
Background
Temporary check dams are structures built across rivers, streams, or other water bodies to 
temporarily impound water. These structures are usually constructed using readily available 
materials and are designed to be easily installed, modified, or removed as and when needed. 
During drought, when lift irrigation regulators of Pattithara village are closed, the water 
levels will reduce and impact the paddy cultivation of the village. 
Resilient technology
Temporary check dams are constructed using sandbags across the Bharathapuzha river near 
the lift irrigation site. This helps to maintain an adequate water level for paddy cultivation. 
The temporary check dams with sand bags erected across the Bharathapuzha river played 
a crucial role in preserving water, safeguarding crops that were in the grain-filling and 
maturity stage
Performance and impact of technology
The construction of the check dams was done in a 50 ha area, benefiting 100 farmers in 
Pattithara village, Palakkad district. Maintainence of an optimal water level during the 
maximum tillering and panicle initiation stages increased the crop yield significantly. 
The technology has helped the farmers to achieve a yield improvement of 34.10% and an 
additional income of  ₹ 24220 ha-1.

Modified rain shelter for year round vegetable cultivation 
Background
Kuttanad region of Kerala is situated below the mean sea level, the entire region is prone 
to flood during the rainy season (June to October). Even upland cultivation is difficult and 
hence it’s almost a farming holiday during the monsoon seasons. 
Resilient technology
To overcome this problem and for cultivation of vegetables throughout the year, ‘Modified 
rain shelter cultivation’ was introduced in a technology demonstration under the NICRA -TDC 
project.  Traditional rain shelters for an area of 40 m2 were made using GI pipes and the 
roof covered with UV stabilized sheets of 200 gauges. Instead of keeping the grow bags 
or growing pots on the ground, an elevated platform at 2-3 ft height was created with 
available materials and the bags kept on them. This helps to overcome the water-logging 
problem during the rainy season. Eighty pots or grow bags can be accommodated in a unit 
of 40m2 which would cost about ₹ 25000 to 30000 for establishment. Leafy, solanaceous 
and cucurbits vegetables can be grown in this unit throughout the year. Planting of different 
vegetables could be scheduled according to the duration and harvesting time to get 
vegetables daily and throughout the year. Trailing vegetables like Yard Long Bean, bitter 
gourd and snake gourd can also be grown where pandal nylon net is used. Drip irrigation 
or sprinkler irrigation and organic management practices can be followed in these units.
Performance and impact of technology
This enables the farmers to cultivate vegetables even under flooded situations ensuring the 
nutritional security. The crops were established well and the farmers harveted very good 
yield up to 1.5 kg of vegetables daily and in a year 500 kg of vegetables could be produced. 
The initial investment could be recovered in a year time by getting safe and nutritious 
vegetables throughout thus reducing the expenditure on the same. The major advantages 
are (i) suitable for cultivation in rainy season (ii) off seasons crops can be cultivated 
(iii) safe to eat food production and (iv) low cost structures with climate adaptability 
ensures year round production of vegetables. 
Scope for upscaling
The technology can be upscaled to low lying, flood/water-logging prone areas through 
convergence with State departmental activities, Central programmes and ATMA.

pods, exhibiting a low incidence of pests and diseases. Additionally, it is recognized for 
its commendable cooking quality. These distinctive features make the variety not only 
visually appealing but also resilient to common challenges in cultivation, offering farmers 
a reliable and high-quality option for their farming. The demonstration was conducted in 
27 farmers’ fields covering an area of 0.34 ha.
Performance and impact of technology
The average yield in homestead farming system without animals was 178 q ha-1 compared 
to 140q ha-1 in farmers' practice of local varieties. But in the case of homestead farming 
system with animals yield increase of 16.5% was observed over farmers practice. The 
BC ratio was also higher compared to farmers' practices in both the farming systems. 
Performance of the crop was found to be encouraging in homestead system cultivation 
compared to other local YLB varieties which are shy bearers in homesteads. So this variety 
can be practiced in homesteads intercropped with many perennial crops where sunlight is 
a limiting factor.

Crop calendar for double cropping in lowland paddy cultivation
Background 
Kumarakom village in Kuttanad agro-ecological unit of Kottayam district of Kerala is 
well-known for distinct lowland rice cultivation at or below sea level. Recurring floods, 
water logging, salt water intrusion, soil acidity, un- scientific farming practices and aquatic 
weeds pose major challenges in rice cultivation, limiting the cultivation to single crop in 
a year. A crop calendar for rice cultivation allows better planning of all farm activities to 
accommodate two rice crops in a year. 
Resilient technology
Cropping calendar is a schedule of the rice growing season from the land preparation, to 
crop establishment and maintenance (weeding, fertilizing) to harvest. The period of time 
from establishment to harvest is varying among different varieties. So, the crop calendar 
allows a farmer to plan farm activities based on weather conditions. The customary practice 
of cultivating one medium duration variety in a year can be shifted to cultivating a medium 
duration variety followed by a short duration variety by evading floods during monsoon 
and salt intrusion during summer.
Thekkepallipadam Padashekaram – a paddy cluster in Kumarakom village comprising of 
70 acres of rice cultivation was selected for demonstration of technology. Crop calendar 
was prepared considering the agro ecological conditions of the area and climate data of 
previous years. Cultural operations were scheduled as per the crop calender with soil acidity 
reclamation, basal application of fertilizers and seed treatment. The first crop sown was a 
medium duration variety, Uma with a crop duration of 120 days.  The land was similarly 
made ready for the second crop with short duration variety Manuratna of 90 days duration. 
in the field and was harvested before salt water intrusion.  
Performance and impact of technology
The crop calender had helped the farmer to realize an additional yield of 5 t ha-1 to the 
farmers.

Paddy sowing using drum seeder for higher yield
Background
In Kerala, broadcasting of seed is the method followed rice cultivation by farmers. Though 
broadcasting takes less time for sowing, uniformity/plant geometry is not maintained and 
the seed rate for broadcasting is around 50-60 kg acre-1. This increases the pest, disease 
incidence and weed menace. Advantages are uniformity in seed sowing, reduction in seed 
rate and cost of thinning is reduced, hill dropping of the seed is achieved and continuous 
drilling is eliminated. 
Resilient technology
The paddy drum seeder developed by Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) is light 
in weight, easy to operate by a single man. TNAU drum seeder consists of four seed drums 
made of fibre mounted over a shaft, ground wheels, floats and handle. The seed drum is 
hyperboloid in shape (truncated cone) with 200 mm diameter having 12mm flat spikes of 
25 mm length kept parallel to the axis of rotation. The slope of the cone facilitates the free 
flow of seeds towards the metering holes. Nine numbers of seed metering hole of 10 mm 
diameter were provided along the circumference of the drum at both the ends at a row to 
row spacing of 20 cm. The floats are provided on either side to restrict the shrinkage and 
to facilitate easy pulling of the drum seeder. Direct paddy drum seeder is used for sowing 
germinated paddy seed directly in wetland field. There is no need for transplantation. 
Baffles are provided inside the seed drum between seed holes resulting in uniformity of 
seed rate throughout the operation. These baffles also ensure hill dropping of seeds. The 
technology was demonstrated in the fields of 10 farmers in 2022 in Kumarakom village of 
Kottayam district 
Performance and impact of technology
In the drum seeder technology, the seed rate could be reduced to 20 kg acre-1, thus reducing 
the cost of one of the major inputs-seed. It was observed that weed control in line sowing is 
easily manageable. Data also indicates that the yield has increased by 2.6 %.

Targeted application of micronutrients in paddy with drone for 
higher use efficiency and crop yield
Background
The application of micronutrients improved the crop yields in rice. Aerial application helps 
in rapid utilization of nutrients and permits the correction of deficiencies in less time than 
would be required by soil application.
Resilient technology
‘Sampoorna KAU multimix’ for rice is a micronutrient mixture developed by Kerala 
Agricultural University according to the soil behaviour of Kerala. This can be applied 
through foliar spray and it is completely soluble in water. The major ingredients of the mix 
are Zinc (5 - 7%), Boron (3.5 - 4.5%), Copper (0.3 - 0.5%), Iron (< 0.2%), Manganese (< 
0.2%) and Molybdenum (< 0.02%). The mix is diluted in water as per the recommendation 
of the Kerala Agricultural University, i.e. 5 g of Sampoorna KAUmix was added to one 
litre of water. The actual quantity of Sampoorna KAU mix for one acre amounts to 2 kg. 
The spray volume required for 1 ha with the developed attachment is estimated at 201 
litres. 
Performance and impact of technology
Foliar sprays with drone has been proven as an effective method for reducing the spray 
volume and operating time to less than one-third of that required by the conventional 
method. KAU Sampoorna micronutrient mixture was aerially sprayed using drones @ 2 kg 
acre-1 at tillering and panicle initiation stages to evade micronutrient deficiencies in the 70 
acre lowland paddy fields of Thekkepallipadam Padashekaram, Kumarakom of Kottayam 
district.  Aerial spray of micronutrients supplied the adequate quantity of nutrients to the 
plants in the demo plots. Spraying with a drone using nozzle produces a small particle size 
so that the surface becomes wider. This results in greater penetration to the leaf surface. All 
these resulted in the formation of a greater number of healthier tillers and other yield 
contributing attributes such as number of grains per panicle and 1000 grain weight over the 
control. Enhancement in these parameters lead to a yield increase of 24.76% in the demo 
plots over control, contributing to lower cost of cultivation in the demo plots. The net 
returns were also higher in the demo plots. Thus BC ratio could be enhanced to 2.59 over 
2.18 in the control plot.

Drone usage in rice cultivation for targeted application to enhance use 
efficiency of micronutrients
Background
Rice, in Kerala, is majorly cultivated through manual transplanting under puddled 
conditions using large quantity of ground water. It requires 5000 litres of water to produce 
1kg of rice and the high-water requirement of rice is mainly due to percolation losses. Rice 
being a water exhaustive crop, requires 500 l of water for single application of nutrients 
in 1 ha. Padichira village’s farmers cultivate rice by puddled transplanting by extracting 
the underground water and involving huge drudgery demanding higher cost of production. 
Hence application of micronutrients with drones was recommended 
Resilient technology
KAU multimix Sampoorna spray @ 2 kg acre-1 was given at 30 and 50 days after transplanting 
and bio control agent liquid pseudomonas @ 1l acre-1 was sprayed 20 and 45 days after 
transplanting through drone in the Padichira village. Application of micronutrients through 
drone helps to conserve water as it only requires 37.5 l to spray micro nutrients in 1 ha as 
compared to 500 l. in addition helps in uniform spray, and saves man days. This in short 
is a water saving technology. During the year of 2022-23, KVK Wayanad conducted 4 
demonstrations covering 30 ha with drone technology,
Performance and impact of technology
Demonstration of drone technology in rice saved 10-15% of irrigation water in rice. It saved 
₹ 3000-3500 ha-1 by reducing the expenditure on application of plant protection chemicals. 
The area under drone technology in the Padichira village has spread to 64 ha which was 
during 2021. During the year of 2022-23, KVK Wayanad conducted 4 demonstrations 
covering 30 ha with drone technology, which yielded 18.53% higher yield than that of the 
transplanted rice and farmers earned a net return of ₹ 82052 ha-1.

Cultivation of cowpea variety VBN3 in summer rice fallow in 
Wayanad district of Kerala
Cultivation of cowpea variety-VBN3 in summer rice fallow for 
enhancing soil fertility and crop yield
Background
Conventional rice cultivation involves intensive tillage followed by intensive puddling 
in standing water which destroys soil aggregation and depletes carbon pools. Crop 
diversification with pulses in rice fallows helps to restore soil quality organic carbon, and 
utilizes residual moisture. Hence diversification with the inclusion of short duration high 
yielding pulse crop is an viable option for the horizontal expansion of area under pulse, as 
well as for the improvement of the overall system productivity and soil resilience.
Resilient technology
Cowpea var VBN3 is used for converting fallow land to annual crops in the Padichira 
village, Wayanad district during the year of 2022-23, KVK, Wayanad conducted 4 
demonstrations covering 18 ha.
Performance and impact of technology
The area under demonstration in the Padichira village has spread to 18 ha which was 
nil during 2021. This technology increased the yields by 10.65% more than that of the 
conventional practice and farmers earned net returns of ₹ 29171 ha-1.

Resource conservation and eco-friendly technologies for climate resilience in 
paddy cultivation in Kuttanad region of Kerala
Background
Kuttanad region is a major rice growing tract in Kerala which lies below MSL. Inherent 
soil acidity, pest incidence and crop loss due to lodging by summer showers are the major 
constraints faced by the paddy farmers in the region. Use of high quantity of seeds for 
broadcasting and indiscriminate use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers resulted in large 
scale environmental degradation. Hence a package of resource conserving and eco-friendly 
technologies comprising of (i) Dolomite application (@ 600kg ha-1) for correcting the soil 
acidity, (ii) use of Drum Seeder for sowing to reduce the seed rate, (iii) soil test based 
fertilizer application to correct the indiscriminate use of fertilizers, (iv) seed treatment 
with Pseudomonas and (v) use of Trichocards for pest management was introduced for 
resilience. 
Resilient technology
A package of ecofriendly technologies comprising of (i) Dolomite application (@ 600kg 
ha-1) for correcting the soil acidity, (ii) use of Drum Seeder for sowing to reduce the seed 
rate, (iii) soil test based fertilizer application to correct the indiscriminate use of fertilizers, 
(iv) seed treatment with Pseudomonas and (v) use of Trichocards for pest management was 
demonstrated to farmers of Kuttanad region of kerala
Performance and impact of technology
Seed requirement could be reduced to 30 kg ha-1 from of 100 -120 kg ha-1 and thus reducing 
the cost of seed to almost 25%.  By the application of Dolomite as liming materials, soil 
acidity could be reduced and corrected the magnesium deficiency.  Cost of fertilizers 
could be reduced by 30% based on Site Specific Nutrient Management (SSNM). As plant 
population was optimum, the number of productive tillers was high and the adequate 
aeration resulted in reduced susceptibility to pest and diseases. Plant has strong anchorage 
and survived lodging compared to 17.2% crop loss due to lodging in traditional broadcasted 
crop. Use of chemicals for the management of pests and diseases could be avoided or 
brought to minimum. Thus this technology package offered resilience to summer showers 
in the harvesting stage and overall resulted in higher growth and yield, reduced use of 
inputs and thus environmental pollution, higher net profit, and enhanced climate resilience.

Targeted spraying of micronutrients with UAV  for enhancing the rice yield  
and minimizing fertilizer cost
Background
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for spraying micronutrients in agriculture is an 
innovative and efficiet approach that offers several advantages. The UAV is attached with 
spray tanks, which can store the micronutrients and spray them over the crops. UAVs 
enable precise and targeted application of micronutrients, reducing waste and ensuring 
that the nutrients are delivered exactly where they are needed. UAVs can ensure a more 
uniform distribution of micronutrients throughout the field. This uniformity can result 
in consistent crop growth and development, reducing the risk of yield variations within 
the same field. It will benefit farmers by increasing agricultural output, quality, and most 
crucially, reducing workload.  With the rising scarcity of agricultural workers. The drone 
gives the best solution as it reduces number of labour and cuts down the production cost in 
conjunction with increased productivity and faster application rate thus saving time. 
Resilient technology
UAV was used for spraying micronutrients in paddy and was administered in 15 ha 
area involving 20 farmers in Pattithara village of Palakkad district during 2022-23. The 
micronutrient spray was carried out at the maximum tillering stage and panicle initiation 
stage. 
Performance and impact of technology
The application of micronutrients through UAV took approximately 25-30 min-ha-1 and 
led to cost reduction of ₹ 1000 ha-1 and  increased the yields by 14.01% as compared to the 
conventional practices adopted by farmers. Net returns obtained was 92280 ₹ ha-1 for demo 
and 15% additional income was obtained by the farmers as compared to traditional practice 
of manual spraying.

Targeted Integrated Nutrient Management (TINM) plan to manage 
yellowing of Arecanut palms and to enhance the nut yeild
Background
Yellowing of Arecanut is a serious problem leading to around 50% yield loss in the area. 
The major reason of yellowing is loss of top fertile soil due to heavy rains in addition 
to poor nutrient management. Targeted Integrated Nutrient Management (TINM) is a 
holistic approach that involves the balanced use of organic and inorganic nutrient sources 
optimizes nutrient availability in the soil. This strategy aims to address nutrient deficiencies 
and imbalances, including those associated with the yellowing of arecanut palms. 
Resilient technology
Targeted Integrated Nutrient Management plan was formulated based on the soil nutrients. 
Soil tests were conducted in the Arecanut field to assess nutrient levels and pH in the soil 
in Pattithara village, Palakkad district. Based on the soil tests, a balanced mix of essential 
nutrients, including 10 kg of OM, recommended dose of NPK, 250 g lime, 100 g MgSO4, 
25 g Zinc, 20 g Boron per palm are applied. Targeted Integrated Nutrient Management 
(TINM) was implemented for five farmers in Pattithara village, Palakkad district. For the 
demonstration, 50 palms were selected for each farmer. 
Performance and impact of technology
Targeted Integrated Nutrient Management (TINM) plan to manage yellowing of Arecanut 
palms in Pattithara village, Palakkad district was implemented in Arecanut farms of five 
farmers. For the demonstration, 50 palms were selected for each of the arecanut farmer. 
The Targeted Integrated Nutrient Management improved the Arecanut yields and net 
returns by 25 and 49% as compared to farmers' practice. In addition there was a significant 
reduction in disease severity by 46% within three months and further 90% reduction was 
observed within seven months. Fresh green colour leaves emerged, indicating decrease in 
the severity of the disease.

Sustainable Integrated Fish Farming (IFF) in low lying coconut channels and 
rain water harvesting structures
Background 
Integrating aquaculture within these channels not only maximizes land utilization but also 
harnesses the natural synergy between coconut cultivation and fishery. Complemented by 
rainwater harvesting structures, this approach ensures a resilient and eco-friendly model, 
fostering a harmonious coexistence of agriculture and aquaculture in a water-scarce 
environment.
Resilient technology
There are lots of coconut garden channels in Kozhikode district which are water logged. 
These channels are unutilized and have been infested with floating aquatic weeds like 
Salvinia. These channels can be effectively used for culturing fishes. Integrated Fish 
farming in coconut based farming system will help farmers to get extra income from fish 
culture. The ammonia and other nutrients released from fish culture helps to improve the 
yield from the palms also. Similarly, in areas with water scarcity, rainwater harvesting 
structures have been constructed using tarpaulin sheets. In some instances, these have been 
utilised for aquaculture mostly using improved strains of Nile Tilapia. These pools have 
lower water levels during summer; have excessive phytoplankton blooms, low dissolved 
oxygen and high ammonia thereby reducing growth and survival of fishes. Tilapia has 
fewer consumer demand and market value, hence many farmers have backed out from fish 
farming. Murrels are air breathing, hardy fishes and have high consumer demand, they can 
be stocked at higher density of 5 nos m-2 when compared with Tilapia which can only be 
stocked @ 2-3 nos m-2 without aeration and filtration facilities. Thus, Murrel cultures with 
formulated feed are ideal for these artificial pools. The ammonia rich pond water can be 
irrigated for crops and the same amount can be replenished to the pond there by improving 
the health of fish and crops.
Performance and impact of technology
Low availability of Murrel seed and formulated feed were the major bottlenecks in 
Murrel farming in Kerala, despite being a high value fish. Recently, hatchery reared 
seeds and commercial formulated feed have become available. These were introduced 
in Maruphonkara village. Murrel fish (Channa striata) were stocked in coconut palm 
channels after, cleaning, removal of aquatic weeds, eradicating weed fishes, bird fencing 
78
and following pre-stocking management practices. Murrel fingerlings were also stocked 
in artificial ponds mainly used for rainwater harvesting. In both the cases Integrated Fish 
Farming approach was followed by irrigating crops with pond water and replenishing water 
in ponds. The production from Murrel farming was 238 q ha-1 when compared to Tilapia 
which yielded 79.5 q ha-1. This higher production was as a result of higher stocking density 
of Murrels being hardy and air berating in nature. The marginal increase in BC ratio from 
Murrel farming 2.03 to tilapia 2.02 was due to higher feed cost for Murrels when compared 
to Tilapia. The survival rate of Tilapia was 85% when compared to Murrels 68% indicating 
the cannibalistic nature of murrels if underfed especially during the initial culture period. 
Overall, the farmers were happy with Murrel farming as they had good market demand and 
the fish were sold twice the price of Tilapia. There was also improvement in the health of 
coconut palm and horticulture crops when pond water was used for irrigation.

Supplementation of area specific mineral mixture for enhancing 
resilience in dairy animals
Background 
Ailoring mineral supplements to the specific needs of local environments enhances the 
resilience of dairy animals, addressing deficiencies and bolstering overall health. This 
targeted approach not only optimizes productivity but also fortifies the adaptability of the 
dairy herd, ensuring sustainable and robust livestock management practices.
Resilient technology
Problem of mineral deficiency and metabolic disorder in all categories of dairy animals 
have been reported due to lower content and low bioavailability of minerals in feed stuffs. 
There is need for the supplementation of mineral mixture to dairy animals. Mineral mixture 
contains all the essential minerals in required quantities. Supplementing mineral mixture 
will help in improving growth rate in calves, increasing milk production, reduces heat 
stress, improves reproductive efficiency and reduce calving interval, increase productive 
life of animals and improve immunity. It can be given at the rate of 50g day-1animal once in 
a day along with the animal feed as per the recommendation of ICAR-NAINP, Bengaluru. 
It will improve overall animal health and immunity and productivity during stress.
Performance and impact of technology
The use of mineral mixtures has not only helped in increasing the milk yield but also 
alleviated problems of anoestrus and repeat breeding to a large extent in Wayanad district of 
Kerala. In a demonstration involving 65 farmers with 120 animals, conducted in a Padichira 
village, during 2017-18 in creased milk yield day-1 was observed with the animals being 
supplemented with balanced mineral mixture to an extent of 18.02% over local practice. It 
has also recorded increased net returns (23.71%) and BC ratio (8.27%) than local practice. 
Usage of area specific mineral mixture for animals has increased from 5-10% to 60-70% 
among farmers in Padichira village, Wayanad district. This intervention is well adopted by 
the farmers of Padichira village.

Climate resilient cages for backyard poultry farming
Background 
In flood-prone areas, where conventional poultry farming is vulnerable to submersion and 
contamination, the implementation of floating cages enhances the resilience of poultry 
operations, safeguarding food production, economic stability, and the livelihoods of 
communities in the face of climate-related challenges.
Resilient technology
Poultry farming during monsoon seasons in the village is affected with flooding and most 
of the people lose their poultry in the flood. Outbreak of diseases is another major problem 
due to flood. The traditional method of housing of poultry in small cages couldn’t protect 
them from these situations. Therefore, poultry cages on raised platform was demonstrated 
to the farmers. Poultry cages were fabricated to accommodate 20 birds in 120 x 90 x 75 cm 
size using wire mesh on all the sides, wooden planks at the bottom and tin sheet as roofing 
material. The height of the cage was standardized at 120 cm using GI pipes to withstand 
flood. Since, the bottom of this cage is fixed with wooden planks and filled with saw dust, 
poultry manure could be effectively utilized for homestead farming. At the same time birds 
could be saved from flood and predators.
Performance and impact of technology
Mortality rate of chicks was reduced to 13% in the new cages compared to 53% in the 
traditional cages.  The average egg production increased by 231% and each household 
could obtain a net return of ₹ 3682 compared to ₹ 432 without intervention. Thus these 
interventions resulted in almost self sufficiency of egg production and a decent income 
to the families of  Edathua village, Alappuzha district with minimum investments and 
efforts. These cages could survive the birds in the worst ever floods in 2018 and 2019. Farm 
women could earn an additional annual income of ₹ 4000 after meeting the household 
consumption.
Based on the observations from the units where the above said climate resilient measures 
were adopted, the average no of bird stock per unit increased from 9 to 22. About 150 cages 
were demonstrated in the Edathua village, Alappuzha district with 50% contribution from 
partner farmers but  more than 300 such poultry cages have been established by farmers 
themselves in these villages.

Climate resilient goat sheds with elevated floor 
Background 
Alappuzha experiences a tropical climate with high temperatures, humidity, and seasonal 
variations in rainfall. This climatic pattern can pose challenges to goat farming by exposing 
the animals to heat stress, diseases, and occasional flooding, especially during the monsoon 
season. The raised floors help in better managing heat stress by improving ventilation and 
airflow, preventing the accumulation of excess moisture, and offering protection against 
waterlogging during heavy rains or floods. This climate-resilient infrastructure not only 
enhances the overall well-being and productivity of goats but also ensures the sustainability 
of goat farming practices in the face of unpredictable weather conditions in the region.

In the Kuttanad villages prone to water-logging every year, goat farmers follow the 
traditional system of goat rearing by keeping a wooden flank on the floor of the shed and 
whenever flood occurs, they simply raise the wooden plank by keeping on bricks. In this 
system mortality is higher due to cold stress and disease outbreak, apart from this, growth 
rate is lower due to inbreeding. To address this issue, a custom designed goat shed of 6 m2 
floor area to accommodate 10 goats was fabricated with materials like PVC pipes, square 
tubes, chain links and shade net, and fixed at 4 ft height from the ground level which was 
ideal as a household unit. The average cost of fabricating this structure was ₹ 35000/- 
which could easily be recovered in a year time with 10-15 goats.
Performance and impact of technology
The average net income from such a modified unit of 10 goats was worked out to be ₹ 
56920 annually on account of the reduced mortality and better growth of the animals. 
Before this intervention, whenever a flood occurs, farmers simply sell out the animals for 
a throw away price for lack of shelters. The partner farmers were happy that they could 
survive the goats even during the infamous floods of 2018 and 2019. As the shelter was 
fixed 1 m above the ground level, flood water never affected the shed and animals. The 
income from the goat increased as they keep the animals throughout the year.
About 90 such goat sheds were demonstrated in three panchayaths as part of the NICRA -TDC
project during the last decade, another 150 similar cages were constructed by farmers 
themselves.

Scope for upscaling
The elevated foat sheds can be upscaled widely through the ATMA, Animal Husbandry 
department, Local Self Governments and other concerned agencies by incorporating in 
their schemes and availing financial or input subsidies to farmers.

Floating duck shelters for overcoming floods
Background
Duck farming is a traditional and location suited economic activity in Kuttanad region, 
which lies below mean sea level and having a lot of water bodies. But the flood occurring 
on almost every monsoon season makes this farming activity difficult as the ducks are 
flown away in most of the cases. 
Resilient technology
The floating shelter was fabricated using GP pipes, PVC pipes and Trafford sheets in 8 ft 
(L) x 5 ft (B) x 7 ft (H) and fixed over the sealed plastic barrels (4 barrels and one no on 
each side). This shelter was allowed to floats freely on water body after tethering with a 
long rope from the side bund. Shelter will not submerge even if the water level rises and 
the shelter also floats at the water level. For routine operations like feeding of ducks and 
collection of eggs the shelter is pulled near the bund and again allowed to float after all 
operations. In the floor of the shelter, PVC pipes (wiring pipes 3/4”) paved evenly in the 
gap of 1.5 cm which allows the faecal materials of duck to drop through this gap.  This 
facilitates the culture of fish in the ponds as an integrated system. 
Performance and impact of technology
Floating duck shelter farmers can rear ducks throughout year without the fear of flood and 
earn reasonable income from duck farming in Wayanad district. Whenever flood occurs, 
farmer could go to the shelter using a fibre boat or any floating type vessel for feeding the 
ducks, if necessary. This PVC pipes are durable and last for more than 20 years. Family 
members are enough to manage such units and external labour is normally not required.

School students, RAWE students and more than 25 farmers groups from the different parts 
of district visited these floating units. This technology was documented and published as 
popular article in leading agricultural magazines. Nearly 60 farmers have replicated this 
technology in Kuttanad Taluk after visiting this unit.
Scope for upscaling
The practice of using floating duck shelters can be upscaled widely through the ATMA, 
Animal Husbandry department, Local Self governments and other concerned agencies by 
incorporating in their schemes and availing financial or input subsidies to farmers.

Climate Resilient Technologies for Risk Prone districts of Kerala
Districts of Kerala are broadly categorized based on their proneness to risk into very high 
risk, high risk, medium risk and low risk based on comprehensive risk assessment (Ramarao 
et al., 2019). Based on the on-farm experimentation being taken up as part of Technology 
Demonstration Component of (TDC) NICRA and also other studies, technologies which 
can impart resilience to climate change and variability for various risk prone districts of 
Kerala are indicated. The specific technologies for each of the farming situation in these 
districts depend on the predominant production systems, resource availability and the 
production objectives of the farmer. Promising resilient technologies for each of the risk 
prone categories for different districts of Kerala are as follows.

Scope for upscaling promising climate resilient technologies
As part of the National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) Technology 
Demonstration Component (TDC), several robust strategies with the potential to mitigate 
the effects of climate change and variability were identified. Through participatory 
demonstrations, various technologies were pinpointed for implementation in 151 districts 
across the country, effectively reducing the impacts of climate change. It is crucial to scale 
out or scale up these options and technologies to counteract the adverse effects of climate 
change
The resilient practices identified as promising within the NICRA-TDC can be seamlessly 
integrated into the existing developmental programs of the country. Numerous programs, 
including the National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture, Mahatma Gandhi National 
Rural Employment Guarantee Programme, and Watershed Development Programme, are 
already operational in several districts. Some of these resilient practices form integral 
components of these programs, and location-specific resilient technologies need to be 
incorporated to benefit a larger number of farmers. While certain developmental programs 
are currently limited to specific locations, there is a pressing need to expand the reach of 
these programs, especially those incorporating resilient practices.
Certain natural resource management technologies require substantial initial investment 
to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change. Due to the diverse guidelines and 
implementation mechanisms across various departments piloting these programs, there is 
a need for convergence at the village level. This ensures that farmers can avail themselves 
of these programs based on their resource endowments and specific farming situations. 
Targeting proven practices depends on the biophysical environments, prevailing production 
systems, and associated vulnerabilities.
Resilient practices, such as drought-tolerant crop varieties, intercropping systems, and 
improved fodder crops, can be expanded by enhancing community capacities and developing 
local enabling mechanisms. The establishment and nurturing of local institutional 
frameworks play a significant role in the adoption and spread of these practices. Policy 
support is essential for the widespread implementation of climate-resilient technologies.
