FOREWORD
Kerala is the only State in India to formulate and implement Five-Year Plans. The Government 
of Kerala believes that the planning process is important for promoting economic growth 
and ensuring social justice in the State. A significant feature of the process of formulation 
of Plans in the State is its participatory and inclusive nature. 
In September 2021, the State Planning Board initiated a programme of consultation 
and discussion for the formulation of the 14th Five-Year Plan. The State Planning Board 
constituted 44 Working Groups, with more than 1200 members in order to gain expert 
opinion on a range of socio-economic issues pertinent to this Plan. The members of the 
Working Groups represented a wide spectrum of society and include scholars, administrators, 
social and political activists and other experts. Members of the Working Groups contributed 
their specialised knowledge in different sectors, best practices in the field, issues of concern, 
and future strategies required in these sectors.  The Report of each Working Group reflects 
the collective views of the members of the Group and the content of each Report will 
contribute to the formulation of the 14th Five-Year Plan. The Report has been finalised 
after several rounds of discussions and consultations held between September to December 
2021.
This document is the Report of the Working Group on “How can Kerala double its 
vegetable production in the next five years?” The Co-Chairpersons of Working Group 
were Dr.T.Pradeep Kumar and Ms.C.A.Letha IAS. Dr.R.Ramakumar, Member of the State 
Planning Board co-ordinated the activities of the Working Group.  Sri.S.S.Nagesh, Chief, 
Agriculture Division was the Convenor of the Working Group and Smt.G. C. Roshni, 
Agronomist, Agriculture Division was Co-Convenor. The terms of reference of the Working 
Group and its members are in Appendix-1 of the Report

PREFACE
As part of formulation of the 14th Five Year Plan, the Kerala State Planning Board had 
constituted working groups of experts in all the major sectors. In Agriculture and Allied 
Sectors, 6 working groups were constituted viz. Agriculture and Cooperation, Animal 
Husbandry and Dairy, Inland and Marine Fisheries, Forest and Environment, Water 
Resources and Regional Packages. To discuss and frame policies in each of these sectors, 
the working groups were further divided into 28 Expert Sub-Groups (ESG) with specific 
mandates.
Each Expert Subgroup held at least three meetings beside one focused group meeting before 
finalising the report. We, the Co-Chairs, place our deep appreciation and gratitude to all 
the esteemed members of the ESG for their valuable contributions in preparing the report. 
We are extremely grateful to Dr. V. K. Ramachandran, the Honourable Vice-Chairperson, 
Kerala State Planning Board, Dr. R. Ramakumar, Member, Kerala State Planning Board

HIGHLIGHTS
•	
Domestic production of vegetable is 
around 15.7 lakh tonnes which meets 
hardly 40 % of the requirement of 
Keralites.
•	
Huge pressure on land and extended 
homesteads limit the scope of further 
extension of open cultivation of vege­
tables in Kerala.
•	
Suggestions for attaining this possible 
yet difficult goal involve meticulous 
planning, re-education, convergence 
of different departments and organi­
zations, as well as the creative use of 
technological innovations

How Can Kerala Double Its Vegetable Production In The Next Five Years
Executive Summary
Introduction: Diverse climatic conditions that prevail in different parts of Kerala facilitates 
the cultivation of a variety of vegetable crops that differ in their temperature requirement, 
cultivation practices, parts used, etc. Huge pressure on land and extended homesteads 
limits the scope of further extension of open cultivation of vegetables in Kerala. Domestic 
production of vegetable is around 15.7 lakh tonnes (excluding tapioca) which meets hardly 
40 % of the requirement of Keralites. Government of Kerala has made a firm commitment 
to double the vegetable production during 14th five-year plan period.
Objective: The mandates assigned are
•	
To assess the progress achieved in increasing area, production, and productivity of 
vegetables in Kerala over the past five years.
•	
To suggest a roadmap to double vegetable production in Kerala over the next five years 
with special focus on increasing productivity and farmer’ s income.
•	
To examine the ways in which the institutions of LSGs, Cooperatives and FPCs can be 
utilized to participate in vegetable production efforts.
•	
To suggest ways in which existing systems of vegetable production are modernized and 
integrated with the different schemes of the Government as well as post-production 
activities.
•	
To review the existing procurement and distribution systems, including Government 
initiatives, and suggest a transparent, technology-driven platform with the active 
support of LSGs, Cooperatives and FPCs.
•	
To suggest ways to reform the existing Government schemes to support production. 
Progress in increasing area production and productivity of vegetables in Kerala over 
the past five years:  In 2018-19, Kerala could nearly double the area and production of 
vegetables in comparison with 2015-16 (Table 1). The area under vegetable cultivation 
increased from 46,500 ha to 82,166 ha with production escalating from 6.3 lakh metric 
tonnes to 12.1 lakh metric tonnes. 
Critical gaps in formulation and implementation of schemes during 13th plan: Several 
critical issues have been identified through the analysis, and these are listed below
•	
Lack of integration between agencies, Department of Agriculture,  VFPCK, Horticorp, 
and LSGs in the implementation of vegetable development schemes. 
•	
Inadequate mechanism to assure the quality and supply of seeds, grafted seedlings, 
bioinputs, limited use of Agromet advisory service, poor adoption of soil test-based 
fertilizer application.
•	
Inadequate storage, transport, and marketing support.
•	
Lack of AEU-based crop production and marketing plan; no production plan or 
staggered crop production for daily supply to potential markets
•	
Incomplete database about farmers and local vegetable production. Potential of IOT 
not exploited.
•	
No proper support for farmers cultivating on leased land
State Planning Board

•	
Identification of beneficiary and distribution of assistance is based on area and not on 
production
•	
Lack of continued support for farmers availing assistance under protected cultivation.
•	
No convergence mechanism to accommodate social organizations involved in vegetable 
cultivation. 
Suggestions: The suggestions put forth by the committee are listed below.
1.	
Promote commercial vegetable cultivation in potential AEUs through cluster approach. 
Adopt location-specific production protocols. The production potential in each AEU 
should be identified and target-based production should be planned accordingly. 
2.	
More emphasis should be given to the attainment of the physical plan target than 
the financial plan at the field level. A production plan needs to be formulated for 
staggered vegetable farming, not only in commercial fields but also in the homesteads 
and institutions. Explore the feasibility of establishing “market intelligence” centres to 
provide an idea of the possibility of the potential crop which the farmers can grow in 
the coming season to fetch maximum price in markets. 
3.	
Promote scientific organic farming that stresses safe-to-eat vegetable, bolstered by ‘Eat 
local’ campaigns, responsible branding, kitchen gardens, and recycling. 
4.	
Adopt a comprehensive policy for popularizing hybrids/high yielding varieties. 
Promote cultivation of market- friendly vegetables among commercial growers after 
identifying potential AEUs. Monitor the quality of seeds supplied by private agencies. 
5.	
State/District-level seed production plan may be prepared for seed and planting 
material production and marketing incorporating farmer participation, State farms 
that promote new nucleus seed, promotion of new varieties, and seed certification. 
6.	
Promote nutrigarden concept in all households and apartments with suitable methods 
and technological interventions.
7.	
Popularise rain shelter, low-cost polyhouse, and net-house cultivation of vegetables. 
Grafted seedlings maybe promoted and training given for their production.
8.	
Promote soil test-based fertilizer application for commercial farming with a thrust on 
INM, and augment soil testing labs. 
9.	
Agromet advisory services should be improved and popularised.
10.	 Popularise open precision farming, mechanization with emphasis on solar pump sets 
and solar-based fencing to prevent the attack of wild animals in vegetable-growing 
clusters. Adopt modern techniques like hydroponics, aquaponics, vertical farming in 
urban and semi urban clusters.
11.	 Adopt IPM, biocontrol agents, and ecological engineering principles; explore newer 
low-toxicity pesticides, promote pesticide literacy. Implement crop insurance against 
the incidence of identified pest and diseases beyond a threshold level.
12.	 Promote R&D of high-quality hybrids and varieties, pest, and disease resistance. 
Tropical vegetable research centre should be established to coordinate and prioritize 
vegetable research.  
13.	 Promote convergence involving  DoA, VFPCK, Horticorp, LSGs, and Kudumbashree, 
and integration of the roles and responsibilities of all the stake holders pooling all the 
7
How Can Kerala Double Its Vegetable Production In The Next Five Years
available resources at various levels of LSGIs 
14.	 Establish a professionally managed, IT-enabled decentralized procurement and 
marketing system that ensures competitive prices to the producers. FPOs/FPCs and 
co-operatives should be exploited in procurement, value addition, and marketing of 
vegetables. 
15.	 More schemes should be devised on FLD for advanced technologies like aeroponics, 
hydroponics, and vertical farming.
16.	 Production-linked subsidy and separate assistance may form part of the subsidy 
schemes. Improve assistance to commercial cultivation of vegetables (cluster) by 25 to 
50%. Bring farmers cultivating in lease land also under subsidy regime.
17.	 Assistance to production of State plan projects may be increased by availing more 
funds from MIDH/CSS schemes. Promote INM, Agromet bulletins, pesticide literacy 
and post-harvest management in campaign mode using Krishi paadashala.
18.	 Procurement and marketing of vegetables should be streamlined by defining clear roles 
to Horticorp, VFPCK, and DoA. Establish district procurement centres, cold storage 
facilities, retail outlets, temperature-controlled supply chain facilities, and processing 
centres. 
19.	 Provide infrastructure support to VFPCK and other farmer markets. FPOs could be 
tasked with providing logistic support. Development of online sales via Thalir brand is 
a priority. Modernization of these markets is also necessary. 
20.	 Cafeteria model allocation is suggested to bring more convergence and effectiveness of 
schemes in output delivery. Out of total outlay, 25 percent is suggested as flexi funds 
under the optional components. The annual fund requirement is projected as Rs.150 
crores. Along with the increase in outlay, the assistance under different components 
may be revised once in three years to account for inflation. Like LSGD schemes, all the 
components under the VDP may be approved in April itself like the green book model. 
21.	 Incentives may be provided to traders and farmers for participation in cluster markets 
as well as a transport support for transporting surplus produce from one market to 
another in times of glut. 
22.	 A major reform is proposed to provide interest free credit to farmers. More 
encouragement for promoting lease-land farming is required. In lease-land farming 
a farmer-friendly certificate system must be introduced to help engage more farmers. 
Similarly, the upper limit of extending assistance may be increased to 15 acres from the 
current 5 acres with adequate budget provision. 
23.	 All assistance under VDP may be provided through the AIMS portal, which needs to 
be revamped, for faster service delivery to beneficiaries. The possibility of developing 
the AIMS portal for marketing also to be explored and expanded. 
24.	 A certification authority may be formed under the DoA for the certification of organic 
agriculture. Export potential of ethnic vegetables under organic branding should be 
explored. 
25.	 Explore the scope of establishing a professional, end-to-end, blockchain-enabled 
logistics and infrastructure supply chain backbone for agricultural produce (mainly

vegetables/fruits/tuber crops) in Kerala.  Promote agri-startups.   
Conclusions: Doubling vegetable production in Kerala by the end of the 14th plan period 
is an attainable yet difficult goal that requires careful planning on different fronts and 
coordination of different agencies. The situation has been analysed in detail, and concrete 
suggestions provided.

How Can Kerala Double Its Vegetable Production In The Next Five Years
1. INTRODUCTION 
The diverse climatic conditions that prevail in different parts of Kerala facilitates the 
cultivation of a variety of vegetable crops that differ in their temperature requirement, 
cultivation practices, parts used, etc. Unlike other Indian States, the absence of a distinct 
winter climate in Kerala provides an ideal situation for growing summer season crops 
throughout the year. Cool season vegetables are also grown in Idukki, Wayanad, and the 
high altitude villages of Palakkad district. Cultivation of bitter gourd, snake gourd, bottle 
gourd, cucumber, ashgourd, ivy gourd, pumpkin, ridge gourd, cow pea, okra, amaranth, 
chilli, brinjal, coleus, Colocasia, amorphophallus, potato, garlic, cabbage, carrot etc. are 
mainly market-oriented. Minor vegetables likes Dolichos beans, chekkurmanis, bird 
pepper, drumstick, winged bean, curry leaf, clove bean etc. are grown in the home garden 
mainly for domestic use. Among the twenty-three agro ecological units (AEUs), vegetables 
can be commercially cultivated in fifteen. Huge pressure on land and extended homesteads 
limit the scope of further extension of open cultivation of vegetables in Kerala. Domestic 
production of vegetable is around 15.7 lakh tonnes (excluding tapioca) which meets hardly 
40 % of the requirement of Keralites. Neighbouring States still contribute bulk of vegetable 
requirement and almost 100 % of potato, onion and tomato is from outside.  Government 
of Kerala has made a firm commitment to double the vegetable production during 14th 
five year plan period. This expert subgroup is assigned with a task of providing a roadmap 
to double the vegetable production in the next five year plan with simultaneous increase in 
income of farmers. The mandates assigned are
•	
To assess the progress achieved in increasing area, production, and productivity of 
vegetables in Kerala over the past five years.
•	
To suggest a roadmap to double vegetable production in Kerala over the next five years 
with special focus on increasing productivity and farmer’ s income.
•	
To examine the ways in which the institutions of LSGs, Cooperatives and FPCs can be 
utilized to participate in vegetable production efforts.
•	
To suggest ways in which existing systems of vegetable production are modernized and 
integrated with the different schemes of the Government as well as post-production 
activities.
•	
To review the existing procurement and distribution systems, including Government 
initiatives, and suggest a transparent, technology-driven platform with the active sup­
port of LSGs, Cooperatives and FPCs.

2. PROGRESS IN AREA, PRODUCTION AND PRODUCTIVITY OF 
VEGETABLES IN KERALA
 
As mentioned in the Kerala Development Report (2021), one of the success stories of the 
13th Plan was the achievements in vegetable production. In 2018-19, Kerala could nearly 
double the area and production of vegetables in comparison with 2015-16 (Table 1). The 
area under vegetable cultivation increased from 46,500 ha to 82,166 ha with production 
escalating from 6.3 lakh metric tonnes to 12.1 lakh metric tonnes (GoK, 2021). The data 
from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on the crop-wise value of output (VOO) of vege­
tables in Kerala also validated this growth shift.

The crop-wise area and production of vegetables in the State in 2018-19 are given in Table 
2. Raw banana and plantains, which are commonly used as vegetables in Kerala households, 
together occupy 19.81% of the total area under vegetables and 33.94% of total vegetable 
production. Tuber crops such as amorphophallus, Colocasia, sweet potato, and other minor 
crops  occupy 18.20% of the area and constitute 16.66% of total vegetable production. 
Cool-season vegetables1 are grown in 4.27% of the total area with vegetables contributing 
to 4.89% of the total production of vegetables. Cowpea remains the most widely cultivated 
vegetable crop with an area of 7008 ha (8.53%), with a total production of 77793.80 MT 
in 2018-19, followed by bitter gourd, snake gourd, and cucumber.  The details of the dis­
trict-wise area are given in Annexure I.
1Potato, carrot, radish, and beetroot are not included. They are classified under cool season vegetables as their commercial cultivation is confined to a small 
geographical area

Efforts have been taken to sustain this growth under Subhiksha Keralam, a project launched 
by the Government of Kerala with the broader objective of attaining food self-reliance by 
enhancing the area, production, and productivity of food grains, millets, vegetables, fruits, 
tubers, and pulses in the State, enhancing income of farmers, employment generation, at­
tracting youth and repatriates to agriculture, strengthening animal husbandry and fisheries, 
and promoting organic farming.
As part of the Subhiksha Keralam project, the Vegetable Development Programme has been 
formulated to promote vegetable production in the State in a safe-to-eat manner and attain 
self-sufficiency in the sector. The scheme will be implemented in a mission mode involving 
all the stakeholders in this sector viz. the Agriculture Development & Farmers Welfare.
It will be implemented in close coordination with the Haritha Keralam Mission with clearly 
defined physical targets at AEU, Panchayat level and other deliverables. The convergence of 
vegetable development activities carried out by LSGD, VFPCK, SHM, KAU and Horticorp 
under the mission is expected to be achieved through the programme. Co-ordination of all 
PSUs, ATMA, organic farming (GAP, PGS System), marketing, infrastructure programmes 
shall be ensured for the success of the programme. Along with the commercial cultivation 
of vegetables (cluster), homestead cultivation will be promoted in all the households in the 
State for producing safe-to-eat vegetables throughout the State. Institutional cultivation is 
another thrust area. Productivity increase is given high priority. The proposed activities and 
corresponding allocation of funds under Vegetable Development Programme 2021-22 are 
given in table 3

With an annual subsidy for vegetable farmers fixed as Rs 20,000 per ha, Rs 25,000 per ha, 
and Rs 30,000 per ha non-pandal, pandal, and cool-season vegetables, respectively, the 
Government of Kerala offers the highest rates of cash subsidy for vegetable farmers in India, 
covering most of the farming expenses, including the costs of seeds, planting material, fer­
tilizer, pesticide, and labour costs.
Introduction of Vegetable Base Price Scheme (Table 4) by the Government of Kerala caught 
nation-wide attention amidst the farmers’ protests against the Farm Acts 2020. Kerala be­
came the first State to set base prices for 16 different vegetables & fruits so that if the price 
falls below the base price, the produce would be procured through Government outlets at

The demand for vegetables in Kerala was estimated at 27.1 lakh MT in 2009-10. It is 
expected that the demand for vegetables will rise to 35.5 lakh MT by 2030 (GoK, 2021). 
Hence, Kerala needs to aim to double the production of vegetables over the 14th plan 
period, which requires more allocation of resources. The total allocation of funds for the 
development of vegetable cultivation from 2012-13 to 2021-22 is given in Table 5. As per 
the report, the fund allocation for vegetable cultivation development for the year 2020-21 
was only 69.47 crore, which dipped from 87 crores in 2018-19. During the current finan­
cial year 2021-22, the allocation is only 74.45 Crore for 17 components under vegetable 
development. Hence, for achieving the target of doubling vegetable production, the funds

The cafeteria model has been suggested for the proposed task. The inflation accounting 
needs to be done periodically to keep pace with the mounting cost of production. It is also 
suggested that more emphasis should be given to the implementation of the physical plan 
rather than the financial plan at the field level. A road map for the formulation of a produc­
tion plan needs to be done for staggered vegetable farming, not only in commercial fields 
but also in homesteads and institutions. When production increases, there will be a high 
probability of glut in the marketing of vegetables and an efficient marketing system needs 
to be developed for handling the produce. Along with other measures, empanelling of the 
traders needs to be done giving them sufficient incentives to them for the market to func­
tion successfully. The data need to be generated and statistically analysed for formulating 
an efficient marketing plan.

How Can Kerala Double Its Vegetable Production In The Next Five Years
3. ROADMAP TO DOUBLE VEGETABLE PRODUCTION IN KERALA 
Doubling vegetable production is a challenge that can be achieved with the participation 
of all agencies, social and political organisations, and ultimately, the people of Kerala. New 
innovations and adoption of best practices should be the cornerstone of this programme. 
Productivity can be enhanced by innovations, integration of technologies and enterprises, 
adoption of new technology, and overcoming false beliefs.
DAILY REQUIREMENT OF VEGETABLES ACCORDING TO ICMR
According to ICMR guidelines, the daily requirement of vegetables for an adult is stipulated 
as
• 50 gram leaf vegetables 
• 50 gram roots and tubers
• 200 gram other vegetables
Pregnant women require more iron (folic acid), and should consume 50 gram leafy 
vegetables per day in addition to the quantities mentioned above.

The above data has not considered the production of tapioca. Tapioca is cultivated in an 
area of 61874 ha in 2018-19 with a production of 23.2 lakh tonne (source: www.ecostat.
kerala.gov.in).  Tapioca is also used for animal feed and industrial purposes. However, 
approximately 50% is utilized for human consumption. Hence, 11.6 lakh tonne may be 
added to the vegetable production basket, making the total vegetable production 27.3 lakh 
tonne. The gap between actual production and consumption will narrow down to 10 lakh 
tonne. However, actual per capita consumption is low in Kerala, as people mostly prefer a 
non-vegetarian plate for main meals.

AEU-BASED PRODUCTION PROTOCOL
This production protocol aims to facilitate the commercial cultivation of vegetables in AEUs 
which are established so that the soil type and climatic conditions are more favourable for 
vegetable cultivation.  There are 5 agro-ecological zones and 23 agro-ecological units in Kerala. 
The agro-ecological zones are coastal plains, midland plains, foothills, high hills, and Palakkad 
main. Among the 23 AEUS, five are commercial vegetable growing areas and another ten have 
the potential for commercial farming. The details are given below:

TIMELY SUPPLY OF QUALITY SEED AND PLANTING MATERIAL

25
How Can Kerala Double Its Vegetable Production In The Next Five Years
Preference is to be given to pest- and disease-resistant varieties and hybrids from the public 
sector. Ensure coordination between KAU, department seed production farms, and VFPCK 
in vegetable seed production. Scientific methods such as seed treatment with bioagents 
and seed priming should be popularized for improved seed germination. Seed priming is 
the controlled hydration and drying of seeds which will enhance seed vigour in terms of 
germination potential and increased stress tolerance, ensure rapid and uniform seedling 
emergence, impart high level of biotic and abiotic stress resistance, and increase crop yield.
Quality planting material
Since the production from various public sector agencies is unable to meet the demand, 
private sector players also have a significant role in supplying planting materials. Regulatory 
measures to ensure the quality of planting materials supplied by private sector agencies are 
quite inadequate, and some unscrupulous elements exploit the situation causing loss to 
growers and adversely affecting sustainable farming.

The strategies suggested for improving the seed supply chain include:
•	
Preparing State/district seed production plans for seed and planting material production 
and marketing, involving/linking various agencies like KAU, VFPCK, Department of 
Agriculture (DoA), NSC and identified seed companies. 
•	
Strengthening quality control mechanisms
•	
Promoting farmer-participatory seed production in self-pollinated crops like cow pea
•	
Improving farms under State DoA by purchasing nucleus seeds of newly evolved 
varieties from KAU and improving infrastructure facilities of the farms/nurseries for 
enhancing quantity and quality of planting materials, etc.
•	
Seed multiplication and popularization of new varieties of vegetables released by KAU
•	
Establishment of a State Level Seed Certification Agency as envisaged in the Seed Act
Popularise use of seedlings and grafted plants
Vegetable grafting is a technique that is used to improve plant production, reduce disease 
susceptibility, and increase plant vigour. Biotic and abiotic stresses are capable of markedly 
reducing the productivity of vegetables. Grafting productive scions onto resistant rootstocks 
has been a common practice to overcome such stresses to growth. The principal biotic stresses 
that can be managed by growing grafted plants are bacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum), 
fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici), and other diseases caused by Pythium 
and Verticillium spp. and root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.). Grafting vegetables on 
resistant rootstocks is a means of controlling root-knot nematodes and other soil-borne 
diseases in areas with intensive land use. Grafting is useful for extending the crop-stand in 
protected structures, as a replacement for methyl bromide applications, or when practising 
speciﬁc low-pesticide or organic production protocols. Raising seedlings under covered 
condition and transplanting early will save time and be more suited for leased lands.
SELECTION OF SUITABLE VARIETIES AND HYBRIDS
There are many high yielding varieties of KAU and ICAR institutes which are resistant to 
major pest and diseases 
Advantages of hybrid varieties include high yield, early maturity, abiotic stress resistance, 
disease resistance, uniformity in growth, flowering, and fruiting, superior quality produce, 
and extended shelf life
27
How Can Kerala Double Its Vegetable Production In The Next Five Years
Preference must be given to pest- and disease-resistant varieties and hybrids from the public 
sector. Research should be focused on the development of multipurpose hybrids and low 
cost hybrid seed production technology to reduce the cost of hybrid seeds.

Lack of information and lack of timely availability of F1 hybrids developed/identified by 
KAU and other ICAR institutions is a major constraint. Prohibitive seed prices charged by 
the private sector as in the case of parthenocarpic hybrids of cucumber need to be curbed. 
Fresh hybrid seed has to be purchased by farmers every year as they cannot depend on 
farm-saved seeds. Coordination between agencies for on-farm testing of potential hybrids 
in major growing pockets like Vattavada and Kanthaloor in Idukki district, and Attappadi

region in Palghat should be ensured. More input and technical skill is required for hybrid 
cultivation, and imparting training to farmers should be given priority.
ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES OF WEATHER IN VEGETABLE CULTIVATION WITH 
THE ASSISTANCE OF AGROMET ADVISORY SERVICES
 Prolonged drought and severe rainfall severely affect the production potential of vegetable 
crops. India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Indian Council of Agricultural 
Research (ICAR) in collaboration with State Agricultural Universities (SAUs), State 
Departments of Agriculture and other stake holders have been implementing the Gramin 
Krishi Mausam Sewa (GKMS) scheme in the State of Kerala with the objective of providing 
crop and location specific weather forecast based Agromet Advisories Services (AAS). 
Agromet Advisory Bulletins that are prepared based on medium range weather forecasts 
and disseminated to farmers as a part of this project are helpful to the farming community 
in arriving at strategic decisions on farming operations with respect to changes in weather. 
Agrometeorological field units entrusted with the preparation and dissemination of Agromet 
Advisory Bulletins are located in five agroclimatic zones throughout Kerala under the aegis 
of KAU. Though these advisory bulletins are prepared and disseminated on every Tuesday 
and Friday in English as well as in Malayalam, its reach is still limited. Dissemination of 
these bulletins is done on a real time basis through direct delivery to farmers. They are also 
displayed on the notice boards of Krishi Bhavans. The bulletins are further uploaded on 
websites of IMD, KAU, mKisan portal etc.  Though different channels were used to improve 
the dissemination, the outreach of these bulletins is limited. The quality of bulletins is to be 
further improved by incorporating location specific inputs. 
 The current Agromet Advisory Services should be strengthened with participation of farmers 
in each block of selected AEUs. This can be attempted in five districts, viz., Trivandrum, 
Kottayam, Thrissur, Wayanad, and Kasaragod on a pilot basis. These farmers should be 
trained to collect and report the different crop stages in relation to time, various weather 
events, data on pests, and disease outbreak etc. This information will be useful in finetuning 
location-based crop weather calendars and in improving the quality of Agromet Advisory 
Bulletins. These lead farmers will play a lead role in disseminating location-specific bulletins 
prepared at the block level.    Moreover, they act as a link between the lab and the land. 
The present system will be continued effectively using the service of lead farmers. Further, 
the service of lead farmers will be used for the effective use of Agromet Advisory Bulletins. 
Regular trainings should be imparted for them to function as climate managers. A monthly 
honorarium is also recommended for them as an incentive for sparing their valuable time to 
work on the project. A two-way communication procedure will be developed between the 
Agromet lab and the farmers and vice versa and this helps in improving the quality of the 
bulletins and their effective dissemination. Moreover, the knowledge of the farmer acting 
as the climate manager regarding weather and agriculture will be improved, which in turn 
help him in achieving a better production. 
BRING MORE LAND UNDER IRRIGATION FACILITIES
•	
Fallow lands or the land where vegetable cultivation is possible should be identified
•	
Cultivation on leased land should be promoted
31
How Can Kerala Double Its Vegetable Production In The Next Five Years
•	
Vegetable cultivation in paddy land in the summer season may be encouraged 
•	
Identify uncultivated barren land and make an arrangement to cultivate it with 
minimum lease amount through cluster/group approach with the participation of 
social organisations.
•	
Popularise drip/trickle irrigation
ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF HIGH INVESTMENT FOR LAND PREPARATION AND 
OTHER INPUTS
•	
Ensure mechanization in land preparation and promote the use of solar pump sets.
•	
Formulate more assistance for leased farmers, as crops grown in pandals require more 
assistance
•	
Arrange the distribution of scientifically proven pesticides or botanicals which may be 
helpful  for plant protection and nutrient management
•	
Subsidy for leased land, other inputs like lime, seed, organic manure and fertilizers, 
plant protection materials, and equipment are to be provided. Emphasis must be 
placed on reducing the cost of cultivation through a group approach
ADOPTION OF SCIENTIFIC NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT FOR VEGETABLES
Cultivation of high-yielding varieties of crops and intensive farming exhaust the soil due to 
their increased productivity, and thus deplete essential nutrients including secondary and 
micro nutrients causing severe threats to sustainable agriculture. Irrational and excessive 
application of fertilizers also lead to soil deterioration and decline in the productivity 
of crops. Soil Test Based Recommendation (STBR) is a widely accepted approach for 
prescribing fertilizers based on the crop need, taking into consideration the soil variability 
of different AEUs. 
•	
Soil acidity is a major problem in all AEUs of Kerala. Majority of soils are strongly 
acidic to moderately acidic, warranting lime application on a regular basis based on pH 
values as per recommendations
•	
Deficiency of calcium which is widespread in acidic soils can also be rectified by liming. 
•	
Magnesium deficiency is of common occurrence in the AEUs and hence, application 
of magnesium sulphate @ 80 kg/ha is recommended
•	
Application of dolomite powder as liming material can also be resorted to since it will 
supply Mg in addition to alleviating acidity and supplying Ca.
•	
The organic matter levels in the majority of soils are between low and medium and 
hence require the application of recommended dose of organic manure/compost/green 
manure. N fertilizers need also be applied based on soil test.
•	
Available P is high in most of the soils, hence application of P fertilizers can be reduced 
to the extent of 25‒50 % of the recommended dose based on the soil P values.
•	
Available potassium status is medium to high, and K fertilizers have to be applied based 
on soil test values. Here, soil test values are in the moderate range, and 60‒100% of the 
recommended dose can be applied. Where soil test values are high, only 25 percent of 
the recommended dose need to be applied.
•	
Boron is deficient in all AEUs and the application of borax @ 10 kg/ha or 0.5% foliar 
spray is recommended.
State Planning Board
32
•	
Zinc deficiency is seen in a limited area where the application of zinc sulphate @ 
20 kg/ha is recommended. Foliar application is particularly better under adverse soil 
conditions.
•	
Kerala soils typically have high/toxic levels of  iron and manganese, which can be 
managed by liming
Strategies to be adopted
Periodic soil analysis and soil test-based fertilizer recommendation should be the rule as 
long as intensive agriculture is practiced. Farmers have to be made aware of the importance 
of periodic soil  analysis before the cropping season and taking corrective measures to 
maintain the crop production capacity of the soil. Soil health cards can be issued to farmers 
which indicates the native nutritional status, problems pertaining to that particular soil, 
and fertilizer recommendations including secondary and micronutrients based on the 
soil nutrient status for the  crops (STBR). Soil health cards will also suggest management 
practices for the observed soil constraints, acidity, alkalinity etc. The analysis of samples 
can be undertaken  by the soil testing laboratories operating in the different campuses and 
research stations of KAU, district-level Soil Testing Laboratories under the Department 
of Agricultural Development and Farmers’ Welfare, Govt. of Kerala, ICAR institutions, 
laboratories under Soil Survey Department, etc., with effective coordination by an apex 
body which can effectively link the activities in a network mode.
Mode of operation
District wise or AEU-wise samples collected from each district should be entrusted with a 
particular soil testing lab.
Routine analysis can be done at each research station and various campuses under KAU 
having soil testing labs by providing additional infrastructure facilities, equipment for 
the analysis of P and K, and supporting staff. Micronutrient analysis can be done at labs 
equipped with atomic absorption spectrophotometer. With such facilities, approximately 
2000 samples can be analysed in each lab in a month with additional staff on temporary 
basis. 
Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) spectroscopy can be adopted, but it is very costly and 
requires in excess of 50 lakh. The ICP can analyse more than 500 samples per day and give 
analytical results for all nutrients except nitrogen (organic carbon). Three KAU-led labs in 
each zone should be equipped with ICP and upgraded as referral labs. 
Mobile soil testing services and rapid soil testing kits can be utilized for soil testing, but only 
organic carbon, phosphorus, and potassium can be analysed and hence, recommendations 
can be given only for N, P, and K. Here, pH indicator papers can be used for determining 
soil acidity/ alkalinity and thus for lime/gypsum recommendations. Farmers can be given 
training to use the indicator papers.
The actual analysis of the sample and giving fertiliser recommendations is only part of the 
soil testing service. To a large extent, the efficacy of this service depends on the care and 
33
How Can Kerala Double Its Vegetable Production In The Next Five Years
effort put forth by extension workers and farmers in the collection and dispatch of samples 
to the laboratory. The collection of soil samples should be done by trained persons and 
assigning this task to private agencies who are not familiar with this type of work will result 
in poor quality samples. 
The responsibility of collecting genuine soil samples from the fields can be assigned to Krishi 
Bhavans and VFPCK of a particular area which can entrust trained farmer organizations or 
farmer groups or Kudumbashree staff for sample collection. Utilizing farmers’ groups will 
also reduce the cost of sample collection. Farmers can be identified at the Panchayath level 
and the work can be coordinated by the assigned institution or agency for that area. The 
collected soil samples from specific areas may be delivered to the local Krishi Bhavans and 
soil testing lab with the assistance of the panchayat.

PROTECTED CULTIVATION AGAINST ADVERSE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS 
• Cultivation is possible throughout the year
• High yield
• Crop rotation depending on market demand
• Comparatively less pest attack
• Safe to eat or organic produce
• Quality produce
• Effective labour management
• Increased chances for mechanization
However, the adoption of polyhouse cultivation is not widespread in Kerala. This can be 
attributed to its disadvantages, such as, 
• Need for structural modification to suit humid hot climate of Kerala
• Limited choice of crops
• Exotic hybrids not suitable for Kerala polyhouses
• High incidence of sucking pests and diseases due to poor management
• Improper training to farmers on sanitation and crop management
• Lack of group approach
•High initial investment
•Lack of support for maintenance
This can be remedied by popularising rain shelters, low-cost poly houses, and net house 
cultivation of vegetables. Crops like salad cucumber, yard-long bean, grafted chilli, and 
cherry tomato can be grown.
Seedlings of vegetable varieties and F1 hybrids suitable for growing in Kerala’s conditions 
may be raised in shade net house nurseries and supplied to growers.  Hence, the establishment 
of shade net house nurseries must be encouraged for the supply of seedlings and grafted 
seedlings, and such nurseries may be recognized by the State DoA.
Adopt integrated pest management (IPM), with emphasis on biological control, 
endophytes, and ecological engineering and promote pesticide literacy. Develop cost 
effective management techniques to prevent the entry of wild animals. Implement crop 
insurance against the incidence of identified pest and diseases beyond a threshold level.
Management of pests and disease infestation 
• Promote cultivation of resistant varieties
• Use grafted seedlings
• Prepare and distribute crop calendar

TO AVOID SURPLUS OF PRODUCE IN MARKET
The potential of modern technologies such as hydroponics, aquaponics, vertical farming, 
container cultivation etc (See Annexure II for details) should be exploited in appropriate 
areas. The use of hormones for improving germination, preventing flower drop, enhancing 
fruit set, and inducing early or delayed harvest need to be exploited for commercial farming. 
39
How Can Kerala Double Its Vegetable Production In The Next Five Years
Effective Use of Farm Machinery
Farm machinery suitable for vegetable cultivation must be promoted. Gender-friendly 
equipment should be designed, developed, and promoted for all stages from seeding to 
harvest.
STORAGE AND MARKETING  
Post-harvest loss must be minimized. Proper marketing interventions targeting each block,

4. PARTICIPATION OF LSGIs, CO-OPERATIVES, AND FPCs IN 
VEGETABLE PRODUCTION EFFORTS
ROLE OF LSGIs ‒ EXISTING SCENARIO
1.	
Watershed-based concept is not being effectively implemented 
2.	
Integrated farming systems (IFS) approach, which is sustainable and gives more income 
to farmers are not being implemented. Integrated projects that involve agriculture and 
allied sectors are not conceptualized.
3.	
Projects for backward and forward linkages of production, procurement, and marketing 
are not prepared at the LSGD level.
4.	
LSGIs are not concerned with active participation and involvement of working 
group members, stakeholders especially bank officials, etc.  in project preparation. 
Many projects are prepared based on the convenience and ease of execution of the 
implementing officers, and there exists duplication and non-convergence of projects at 
the level of various LSGIs  and between LSGI and Departmental schemes.
5.	
The problem of providing credit to lease land farmers is not being addressed.
6.	
The possibilities of utilizing fallow lands for vegetable cultivation is not being actively 
explored by LSGIs.
7.	
Despite provisions in the project guidelines for enterprises to provide revolving fund 
and interest subsidy, there is a paucity of organizations in various LSGISs in the areas 
of input production, procurement, value addition and product diversification, and 
marketing.  LSGIs have not actively engaged in these sectors.
8.	
LSGIs have not so far explored the possibilities of giving assistance, support price, and 
production bonus for organically and safe-to-eat mode of production of vegetables and 
other produce.
ROLE OF CO-OPERATIVES ‒ EXISTING SCENARIO
1.	
The huge potential of these institutions in the areas of input supply, ensuring credit 
needs, procurement of vegetables produced, marketing and value addition, etc. are not 
exploited at LSGI level.
2.	
There are no concerted efforts on the part of LSGIs in actively promoting the 
participation of these institutions in the sectors of agricultural development, increased 
income generation of farmers, creating employment opportunities for gulf returnees, 
and youth and local economic development.
ROLE OF FPOs/FPCs ‒ EXISTING SCENARIO
Since these institutions are newly formed, their potential has not been exploited fully in 
increasing vegetable production in the state.
ROLE OF LSGIs ‒ THE WAY FORWARD
1.	
Provide assistance and make available seeds/seedlings, manures and fertilizers, plant 
protection chemicals, etc. to vegetable farmers at a subsidized rate. The grama 
panchayath should concentrate only on production-oriented activities.
2.	
Pharmacies for plant-protection chemicals and other inputs should be attached with 
Krishibhavans similar to the ones associated with Primary Health Centres, Veterinary 
State Planning Board
42
Dispensaries, Ayurveda/Homoeo dispensaries, etc.
3.	
Block panchayath should provide all the required seeds and planting materials with 
the help of a block-level nursery. Seed multiplication plots of high-yielding and newly 
released varieties of different crops should be carried out at the block panchayath level, 
and should be supplied to the beneficiaries of the grama panchayath-level projects. 
4.	
There should be a production plan and marketing plan for vegetable production and 
this should be prepared at the block panchayath level based on AEZs and AEMUs. 
Procurement can be made at the block panchayath level.
5.	
LSGIs should ensure the procurement of locally produced vegetables from eco shops 
and other farmers’ markets under their control for schools and Anganwadis to use in 
their feeding programmes.
6.	
Farmers/farmers’ groups/SHGs, etc. should be trained in modern technologies 
for vegetable production. This may be done at the block panchayath level with 
the strengthening and active participation of Block Level Agricultural Knowledge 
Centres (BLAKC). Necessary infrastructure facilities may be provided to BLAKCs for 
conducting trainings. 
7.	
Fallow land suitable for vegetable cultivation should be fully used for the same. Grama 
panchayaths should take a lead role in ensuring this.
8.	
There are various agencies and groups involved in vegetable cultivation viz., Farmers, 
Farmer’s groups, member farmers of FPCs, Kudumbashree SHGs, HADA, cluster 
farmers of VFPCK, Co-operatives, etc. The entire coordination and convergence 
of these activities should be done at the grama panchayath level only. Projects for 
providing infrastructural facilities to VFPCK and HORTICORP markets may be 
taken up by the block and district panchayaths.
9.	
District panchayaths should fully concentrate on marketing and supply chain activities, 
infrastructure development, etc.
ROLE OF COOPERATIVES ‒ THE WAY FORWARD
1.	
Form SHGs of vegetable farmers at the grama panchayath level
2.	
Provide interest-free loans to farmers, farmers groups/SHGs
3.	
Provide all the required inputs in kind to farmers, farmers groups/SHGs from the 
depot of the bank. A portion of the loan may utilized for this and the remaining 
amount may be released in cash for meeting labour expenses.
4.	
Procure entire marketable surplus of farmers by fixing a floor price.
5.	
Set up sales outlets and sell the produce through them, while forming a network of 
sales outlets of cooperatives, department markets, etc.
6.	
Procurement of farmers’ produce from the production sites to procurement-cum-sales 
centres through refrigerated reefer vans and ensure the demand and supply at different 
points.

5. MODERNISING EXISTING SYSTEMS OF VEGETABLE 
PRODUCTION AND INTEGRATION WITH GOVERNMENT-  
AND LSGD SCHEMES AND POST-PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES
The existing system of vegetable production should be modernized with an emphasis on INM 
(integrated nutrient management), IPM, and climate-smart crop production with the assistance of 
timely information on weather parameters.
INTEGRATED NUTRIENT, PEST, AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT FOR BETTER 
PRODUCTIVITY AND PROFITABILITY IN VEGETABLES
Most vegetables are seasonal crops which live only for a period of 3‒4 months during which they 
grow, flower, fruit, and die. So, providing the correct quantity of all the required nutrients at the 
right time is very important. The production potential of newer varieties and hybrids are very high, 
but to achieve this, the management of the crop should be very scientific.
Limitations of our soil
Kerala is in a high rainfall zone and the soil is deficient in basic elements such as potassium, calcium, 
magnesium and boron. The iron and aluminium contents are very high, and sometimes reach toxic 
level. The soils are very acidic with low cation exchange capacity (nutrient holding capacity) and 
water holding capacity. These limitations can be overcome by the addition of organic matter, soil 
amendments, and chemical fertilizers. Organic matter releases nutrients only very slowly, and the 
addition of chemical fertilizers will help address this . Providing foliar nutrients is also beneficial for 
supplementing with high-quality nutrition.
Integrated Nutrient Management forms the basis of integrated pest and disease management. 
Losses due to pest and disease is high in vegetables, and organic way of management such as use of 
homemade botanicals, biological control agents are though useful has lots of limitations in commercial 
cultivation. Preventive and frequent application are necessary which escalates the cost of cultivation. 
Fruit flies, internal tissue borers, hoppers, bugs, mites, and nematodes cause considerable economic 
loss. Downy mildew, bacterial wilt, cucumber mosaic virus, bhindi yellow vein mosaic virus etc., 
also cause severe loss to farmers. Such losses affect the confidence of the farmer and farmers’ groups. 
For all of them, immediate and effective remedy is scientific use of pesticides. Rather than fuelling 
chemophobia, the department should impart pesticide literacy to the farmers. Newer pesticides 
are comparatively less toxic, more selective, cause less environmental hazards and require only very 
small quantities to be effective. Use of protective clothing, observance of waiting period, and proper 
disposal of the containers will have to be emphasized. For commercial and semi-commercial scale 
cultivation, chemical fertilizers and pesticides are essential. They should be used in such a way that 
farmers, consumers, and the environment is not adversely affected, which is possible by providing 
pesticide literacy trainings. Integrating different pest management methods in a harmonic manner 
is essential to achieving long-term results. Judicious crop rotation should be followed to prevent pest 
outbreaks. GAP (Good Agricultural Practises) with an emphasis on safe-to-eat vegetable production 
need to be popularized.
EXISTING SCHEMES FOR VEGETABLE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION
State Plan 
Please see the first chapter for details. 
Central Schemes
MIDH. The terms of the MIDH scheme are as listed below:
State Planning Board
46
1.	
Seed production for vegetables: Assistance is given for seed production of both open 
pollinated and hybrid seeds (both for public sector): In 2021-22, a physical target of 
30 hectares was sought and implemented: No target is sought under hybrid seeds
2.	
Assistance for creation of seed infrastructure: Rs 2 Crores: No target is sought 
3.	
Area expansion: Vegetable production (hybrid) : Target of 1000 ha (Assistance of Rs 
50,000 per ha)
Suggestions. Some suggestions pertinent to the scheme are given below.
•	
In the existing schemes, there is very little focus on productivity improvement, and the 
current focus is on area expansion.  
•	
More schemes should be devised on FLD for advanced technologies like aeroponics, 
hydroponics and vertical farming, and for bee keeping : technology may be adapted 
and tested from research institutes IIHR, KAU, etc. and tested  before popularising: 
after successful field testing during the first three or four seasons, schemes may be 
devised for assistance to beneficiaries on such technologies 
•	
Production-linked subsidy and separate assistance may form part of subsidy schemes 
(differential subsidy rates for cucurbits/cool season vegetables/leafy vegetables)
•	
Expert opinion considers protected cultivation schemes a failure. However, due to poor 
land availability, new schemes may be devised for protected cultivation with renewed 
vigour in various years (for installation and cultivation during the initial years and 
maintenance at regular intervals till stabilisation); a strong component for extension, 
and good service staff should be present 
•	
Assistance to State plan projects may be increased by availing more funds from MIDH/
CSS schemes  
•	
Separate strategies and schemes for urban and rural homesteads

6. EXISTING PROCUREMENT AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM 
INCLUDING GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES AND SUGGESTIONS FOR 
A TRANSPARENT, TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN PLATFORM
Among the multitude of challenges faced by vegetable growers in the State, the most 
important challenge faced by them would be finding a market to sell their produce for an 
assured reasonable price. Unlike paddy, there is no organized mechanism to procure all the 
fruits and vegetables produced in the State at a fixed procurement price. The perishability 
of the commodity makes this task highly challenging for any agency involved in the 
procurement, storage, and distribution of vegetables.
The Kerala State Horticultural Products Development Corporation Limited (Horticorp), 
with 14 centres and 4 sub centres, is an agency established by the State to procure and 
distribute fruits and vegetables in the State. However, with the present infrastructure, they 
can procure approximately twenty thousand metric tonnes of produce worth Rs. 60 crores 
annually. Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) serves as a facilitating 
agency that helps the farmers undertake wholesale marketing of their produce through 
290 farmers’ markets (Swasraya Karshaka Samithis) that are established around major 
production centres and handles approximately one lakh metric tonnes of produce worth 
Rs. 300 crores. The DoA owns and operates six wholesale markets in the State. Many eco-
shops, weekly markets, and cluster markets were also initiated by the department all over 
the State to take up the marketing of fruits and vegetables. Cooperative societies and Local 
Self Government Institutions (LSGI) also operate hundreds of markets. Though there is 
no single well-established private agency capable of controlling the price of the produce in 
the State, the marketing of fruits and vegetables in the State is mostly undertaken by these 
unorganized private players, and hence, their presence influences the price realization in 
fruit and vegetable commodities. The State intervenes in these markets on festive occasions 
to regulate the price.
In a nutshell, though there are public, private, and Co-operative markets in the sector, the 
available marketing infrastructure is inadequate and is not regulated by any specific State-
level legislation. Without ensuring adequate marketing infrastructure that could fetch a 
reasonable price for the produce, any attempt to double the vegetable production would 
be incapable of meeting the ultimate goal of the initiative, namely, sustainable production, 
procurement, and distribution of vegetables in the State.
KERALA STATE HORTICULTURAL PRODUCTS DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION 
LIMITED (HORTICORP)
Kerala State Horticultural Products Development Corporation Limited (Horticorp) is 
a fully owned Government company under the DoA, Government of Kerala, and was 
registered with the Registrar of Companies, Kerala in 1989.
Volume handled and turnover
During the financial year 2019-20, Horticorp handled approximately 21336 MT of fruits 
and vegetables amounting to Rs.59.24 crores, and during the financial year 2017-18, we 
State Planning Board
50
handled approximately 19211 MT of fruits and vegetables amounting to Rs.67.95 crores.
Infrastructure, geographical coverage, and governance
Horticorp has 13 District Procurement Centres covering all the districts except Kasaragod, 
and 4 sub-centres in Chadayamangalam, Harippad, Guruvayoor, and Vadakara. In all these 
centres, fruits and vegetables are procured from farmers, farmer clusters, Swasraya Karshaka 
Samithis, and agriculture wholesale markets at reasonable prices. Horticorp procures fruits 
and vegetables directly from the farmers at rates that are 10 % more than the prevailing 
wholesale market rates and is committed to buying whatever is produced by the farmers 
at times of glut. The corporation has a wide marketing network throughout the State for 
the marketing of fruits and vegetables to cater to customer demands. Horticorp is the only 
one agency in the Government sector involved in the marketing of fruits and vegetables 
through the 129 Haritha outlets, 278 franchisee stalls, 25 mobile vending units, and 515 
Government and private institutions including old age homes, pre metric hostels, prisons, 
and correctional homes, hotels, schools, and KTDC at prices 10‒30 % lower than the 
prevailing market prices. 
Currently, all the district-level procurement and distribution centres are managed by 
Assistant Director-level officials of the DoA Development and Farmers Welfare. This 
will enhance the efficiency of these centres and help to maintain a liaison with other 
line departments. This will also enhance district-level marketing as well as the eco-
shops under various Krishi Bhavans. 
Issues and Challenges
The production of vegetables and fruits shows an upward trend owing to the various schemes 
and measures undertaken by the DoA and allied agencies in this sector. This is a call for 
Horticorp, in its role as an experienced agency in fruit and vegetable marketing under the 
state government, to enhance its marketing and distribution network and ensure a fair 
price for the farmers’ produce. However, without adequate storage and processing facilities, 
Horticorp cannot manage the large quantities of vegetables that are being procured from 
vegetable clusters, VFPCK Swasraya Karshika samithies, and wholesale markets. Moreover, 
the excess produce procured during glut would incur a huge loss to the executer and wastage 
of a huge quantity of vegetables. 
From the available statistics (Annexure I), the various fruits and vegetables are selectively 
cultivated in certain districts. Some vegetables are abundant in some districts, while others 
might be scarce. Moreover, the production of most fruits and vegetables is seasonal in 
nature. Certain vegetables that are produced in particular clusters cannot be sold through 
the outlets already available with Horticorp. On the other hand, the hundreds of eco-shops 
owned by the department may need specific items from other markets. 
By planning a two-fold increase in the production of fruits and vegetables necessitates a 
shift in cultivation from tuber crops and banana and increasing the productivity of existing 
crops by achieving a 20% annual augmentation in production. Horticorp should handle 
approximately 1000 to 20000 metric tonnes every year. The excess produce that accumulates 
in some districts should be transported and evenly distributed through the Haritha outlets, 
eco shops, and sales outlet run by the co-operative departments and Kudumbashree under 
the LSG department.
51
How Can Kerala Double Its Vegetable Production In The Next Five Years
Prospects and strategies for integration
To coordinate business activities effectively, Horticorp needs more infrastructure and retail 
business strategies. The wholesale market held by the DoA and VFPCK, and the retail 
market held by Horticorp and Krishibhavans need to be coordinated to ensure a fair price 
for the farmer and fresh and healthy fruits and vegetables at a fair price for the consumer. 
Under these circumstances, a strategic shift in the marketing activities of Horticorp needs 
to be implemented to cope with the increased production and localized availability of 
fresh fruits and vegetables. Timely harvest is essential for maintaining quality, and various 
primary post-harvest operations decrease the spoilage and damage of fruits and vegetables. 
This will benefit farmers by increasing the price and marketable surplus. 
To achieve these ends, the District Procurement Centres and their distribution systems need 
to be modernized. The following suggestions have been made by Horticorp to facilitate the 
doubling of farmer’s incomes in five years.
1.	
Hygienically designed and easily cleanable district procurement centres with sufficient 
storage capacity in each district.
2.	
Cold storage facilities for highly perishable commodities at Idukki, Palakkad, and 
Wayanad.
3.	
Establishment of retail outlets under each LSG unit all over Kerala with the help of 
LSGI and Primary Co-operative Societies.
4.	
Temperature-controlled supply chain facilities to link District Procurement Centres 
with all municipalities and corporations.
5.	
Establishment of processing centres at production clusters with the help of Primary 
Co-operative Societies.
6.	
Temperature-controlled vegetable van to facilitate temperature-controlled supply chain 
facilities. 
VEGETABLE AND FRUIT PROMOTION COUNCIL KERALAM (VFPCK)
Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) is a company constituted 
under section 25 of the Indian Companies Act, 1956. The activities of the council are 
governed by a Board of Directors with Agriculture Minister as its chairman. Farmer markets 
under VFPCK have established a system of institutionalized group marketing which has 
successfully endured two decades. The Market Intelligence Centre managed by VFPCK 
collects information on arrivals and prices of commodities in Kerala and neighbouring 
states, and this information is disseminated through print and visual media and to all SKS. 
VFPCK also undertakes the brand promotion and establishment of branded retail outlets 
called Thalir and promotes value addition. Recently, VFPCK has ventured into exporting 
fresh fruits and vegetables to the Middle East, Singapore, and Europe. 
Volume handled and turnover
During 2020-21, all 290 VFPCK SKSs traded a total of 1,16,385 MT of fruits and 
vegetables worth Rs.216 crores. The total quantity of fruits and vegetables traded and the 
annual turnover of these markets in the last five years given in table 22.

Recently, VFPCK has exported 42 metric tons of produce including 4 metric tons of 
vegetables.
Infrastructure, geographical coverage, and governance
There is a network of 290 VFPCK Farmer Markets (Swasraya Karshaka Samithi, SKS) 
functioning across all 14 districts of Kerala with an annual average of one lakh MT of 
produce and an annual turnover of Rs. 250‒3002 crores,  making it the single largest 
organized marketing network of farmers’ markets in the sector in Kerala. The major 
fruit crops handled by these markets include different types of bananas such as nendran, 
njalipoovan, palayanthodan, and robusta, and a considerable quantity of jack, pineapple, 
and papaya. Through these markets farmers trade an array of vegetable crops such as cowpea, 
bitter gourd, snake gourd, cucumber, ash gourd, coccinea, brinjal, bhindi, tomato, chilly, 
yams, and diascorea. Many cool-season vegetables like potato, carrot, cabbage, cauliflower, 
beetroot, garlic, and coriander leaves are also traded through these markets. These markets 
are managed by an executive committee constituted by master farmers from the associated 
self-help groups with VFPCK officials as ex-officio members. These markets are closely 
monitored, and the accounts are audited monthly by a chartered accountant.
In response to the escalating demand for semi-processed, ready-to-cook, and ready-to-eat 
food products in Kerala, VFPCK has launched the first outlet for branded vegetables in 
the State with the brand name Thalir. Apart from this, infrastructure support has been 
provided to establish a total of 63 eco-shop model outlets (Thalir Green outlets) across the 
State to support farmers in the production and marketing of safe-to-eat produces. VFPCK 
has also established two centres for the procurement, processing, and trading of jack fruit 
at Wayanad & Idukki and a total of seven primary processing centres. The Council also 
provided infrastructure and techno-managerial support to cut vegetable units, dehydrated 
ripened banana units, packhouse for banana and vegetables, chips unit, tapioca processing 
unit, and branded retail franchise outlets called Sasya.
2This market system has been in place for the past two decades and had been showing a steady upward trend in growth till 2017-18 when the state witnessed the 
worst flood in a century. Like other agrarian sectors, the flood has affected the fruit and vegetable sector also, and it was reflected in the drop in quantity and 
turnover in the following year. Although it picked up the next year in terms of both quantity and value, the year 2020-21 has been disappointing in terms of price 
realization. Owing to the economic crisis due to the COVID pandemic, there was a sharp decline in the average price realized by the commodities.
53
How Can Kerala Double Its Vegetable Production In The Next Five Years
Issues and challenges
Even though VFPCK’s group marketing concept is considered a replicable model for good 
participatory marketing, it did not perform with the same efficiency everywhere. The 
concept of participation implies the existence of a homogenous group. However, on the 
ground, a group is comprised of individuals with varying views and perceptions, who might 
respond differently to the same issues. This characteristic of a group could be a strength 
while solving unforeseen issues in market management but could be counter-productive 
in some cases. If the marketing committee fails to identify good traders, or exhibits a lack 
of commitment, it would result in these traders dominating the market, undermining the 
possibilities of realizing better prices for the commodities. Though the auction system is 
followed in most VFPCK markets, this tried and tested method for better price realization 
will not be completely effective in markets where proper grading is not followed.
Traders are not a homogeneous category and vary in their trading behaviour. Unfortunately, 
even when a Government agency like HORTICORP procures the produce, there is a 
considerable delay in payment which needs to be addressed. If there is a delay in payments 
to the farmers, it would affect the timely execution of cultivation activities. This requires 
constant follow-up and strict monitoring to recover the payment from these traders. 
Strengthening these markets requires constant monitoring from the facilitators and support 
from the State. Today, facilitators are overburdened with the tasks of managing 2‒4 such 
markets, and an attempt to double vegetable production might put more pressure on them. 
Improving staff strength could help in handling the increased inflow of produce.
This model of group marketing has been replicated by various Government agencies. 
Unfortunately, the number of markets established in some panchayats is not in proportion 
to the production from that area. These markets established by various agencies target 
the same farmers, and also seek the same set of traders, resulting in farmers losing their 
bargaining power and the traders dictating the price. Often, the farmer markets find it 
difficult to retain their member farmers as they are lured by the other markets or traders with 
a temporary hike in price, affecting group cohesion. The same farmers enrol as members 
in multiple organizations with the same objective. This brings in conflicts, questioning the 
sustainability of those institutions.
Financial support to farmers is channelled through different Government organizations, 
viz. Krishi Bhavans, VFPCK, other organizations like Sanghamythri. However, the same 
farmers are given differential financial aid by these organizations for the same activity. This 
causes a shift in the loyalty of farmers, ultimately affecting the very foundation of farmer 
collectivization built on trust and commitment. Self-reliance and self-governance were the 
pillars on which the VFPCK markets have been built and this helped them endure a quarter-
century-long journey successfully. All newly established marketing initiatives, except that 
of VFPCK, are provided with initial capital which once drains out, might fail to keep the 
interest of the stakeholders and break the system down.
Though traders are an integral part of a marketing system, forming cartels and reducing 
the price would ultimately make farming less profitable for the growers, forcing them to 
State Planning Board
54
leave the profession. Eventually, the traders too will be forced to seek new means for their 
livelihood while consumers will become more dependent on other States to meet their 
requirements. The inevitable outcome would be the collapse of all these markets.
Future prospects and strategies for integration
Doubling vegetable production would demand efficient marketing avenues to dispose of the 
marketable surplus at a reasonable price. If not planned and managed efficiently, this might 
turn counter-productive with market glut and price fall. In this context, the following steps 
could be taken for managing the current crisis,
1.	
The concept of panchayat-wise wholesale markets shall be initiated only where there is 
sufficient produce and enough growers to run it sustainably. In areas with established 
VFPCK markets, new markets should be avoided, or merged or integrated with the 
existing VFPCK market. Beneficiaries in that area may be enrolled in a single market 
and all the financial supports for fruits and vegetables are to be channelized through it. 
2.	
All Government funds for marketing of the produce should be routed through farmer 
markets based on the quantity traded and the financial support provided for a particular 
activity should be made uniform. 
3.	
Except in unavoidable circumstances, HORTICORP shall procure produce from the 
local farmer markets, and not directly from the individual farmers.
4.	
The markets may be encouraged to engage in retail tie-ups with HORTICORP, 
Kudumbashree, Civil supplies, Consumerfed, etc
5.	
Eco shops should handle only produce with GAP or PGS certificate, procured from 
wholesale farmer markets under VFPCK or other Government agencies.
6.	
The members should be incentivized to grade their produce to be traded in a common 
brand, echoing their uniqueness.
7.	
Damage to fruits and vegetables caused by careless handling during harvesting, 
packing, transportation, storage, etc should be avoided. Proper training to farmers and 
developing a protocol for post-harvest handling will help them get a better price for 
their produce. Produce should be handled carefully and transported in crates, cartons, 
and gunny bags having a brand logo.
8.	
Owing to its perishable nature, fruit and vegetable marketing involves tremendous 
risk and hence, the markets need to be supported with market intervention to avoid 
distress sales. Supports like market intervention, base price support, and periodically 
revised sales promotion incentive are to be provided considering inflation accounting. 
9.	
At the time of glut, excess produce can be pooled district-wise for sale, if needed. 
The support needed for this, including permission for using the premises of identified 
spots, transportation support for pooling the produce, support for infrastructure, 
labour, etc., have to be provided.
10.	 Risk fund3,  a scheme intended to support farmers at the time of price fall by providing 
fair price support and exigency, has been welcomed by the farmers. During the FY 
3SKS consortium finalizes the base price for the financial year for the major crops in the district based on the cost of cultivation. These prices are reviewed at HQ 
against MIC data and the base price for each quarter will be finalized. When the price of first-grade produce traded in the SKS falls below the base price the differ­
ence between the approved base price and the actual price received by the member farmer will be reimbursed.
55
How Can Kerala Double Its Vegetable Production In The Next Five Years
2019-20, Rs. 60.86 lakhs was received as a contribution from GoK and Rs.40.57 
lakhs was collected as a beneficiary contribution (1984 beneficiaries). This needs to be 
continued and revised to support the growers.
11.	 The base price scheme has been declared for only 16 selected fruits and vegetables and 
does not include all the major crops of our farmers. The activities of the district level 
price monitoring committee (DLPMC) which was constituted to declare the market 
price of produce when it falls below the base price should be more effective for the 
successful implementation of the scheme. It is imperative to provide timely assistance 
to the farmers.
12.	 The committee also fails to declare the base price for all the eligible items under the 
scheme. Therefore, products that are not included in the base price scheme can be 
supported with the risk fund scheme.
13.	 Provision of infrastructure for farmers’ markets in the form of land and building would 
provide an identity for the farmer market, space for the sorting, grading, and marketing 
of produce, and reduce the expenses of the Samithi in terms of hire charges. The 
presence of a permanent structure could instil a sense of ownership and pride among 
the member farmers improving group cohesion and eventually, ensuring sustainability. 
VFPCK provides the Samithies with land and buildings for trading. Generally, the 
building consists of a trading hall, an office room, a room for the storage of inputs, 
and an agro clinic which will provide technical information. Currently, only 126 out 
of 290 VFPCK markets have their own building. Infrastructural supports need to be 
provided for the construction of own building for other eligible markets and the fund 
needs to be allotted for meeting the maintenance expenditure and modernization of 
the existing buildings.
14.	 In SKS, marketing of the produce is carried out twice or thrice a week and farmers face 
difficulty due to a lack of storage facility. A modern cost-efficient storage facility should 
be provided to reduce post-harvest losses.
15.	 Support is sought for managing the other projects implemented by VFPCK such as the 
establishment of Primary Processing Centres, VFPMC, branded retail outlets, and Jack 
fruit Trading Centre, etc.
16.	 Value addition can help in ensuring better price for produce, especially during market 
glut. The value-added product should be procured and supplied by Government 
agencies and SupplyCo.
17.	 SKS produce should be branded. Linkages with large supply chains or companies can 
ensure an assured market for such produce. Geotagging each plot of land and thus 
maintaining the traceability of the crop output from the farm until it reaches the 
customer could be undertaken.
18.	 Among the 300 markets notified as nodal markets in Kerala under the base price 
scheme, 250 are VFPCK markets. However, only less than 180 SKS are computerized. 
In some areas, the sales details of many farmers could not be entered into the AIMS 
portal within the stipulated time due to a lack of infrastructure support like computers 
and internet facilities. This leads to a delay in entering the sales details of those 
State Planning Board
56
farmers into the portal. Infrastructure facilities for technology-driven marketing with 
computers and high-speed internet have to be supported.
19.	 Our present accounting software for SKS is V-soft which was developed in-house. It is 
a modest software and easy to manage, but owing to data security issues, the data is not 
connected to a single server. Better accounting software like Tally needs to be installed 
in all SKSs to handle the expected output from the doubling of vegetables.
20.	 The possibility of integrating VFPCK markets with eNam needs to be explored to 
facilitate pan-India trade of fruits and vegetable produced in the State. This has to 
be carefully designed for better price discovery through a transparent auction process 
based on the quality of produce along with timely online payment.
21.	 Integration with other institutions needs to be done. Though some of the LSGDs 
support VFPCK markets in isolated cases, it is not the norm for these LSGDs to provide 
budgetary allocation for these markets. This must be revisited and activities of VFPCK 
need to be supported by this well-acclaimed decentralized system of governance.
22.	 VFPCK has been entrusted to form 70 FPOs to assist the farmers in areas of inputs, 
production, processing and value addition, market linkages, credit linkages and use of 
technology, etc. While forming the FPOs, the VFPCK self-help group will act as base 
level clusters and the VFPCK farmer market can act as FPOs. The activities of VFPCK 
markets could be integrated with the FPOs.
23.	 Recently, VFPCK has ventured into exporting and initiated trading of fruits and 
vegetables to different markets outside India, such as Kuwait, Dubai, Singapore, and 
UK, under the brand ‘Thalir’, which needs to be promoted. Plans can be made to 
export at least 10% of the produce in the SKS with the help of Government support 
schemes.
24.	 Support is also being sought for establishing more branded Thalir retail outlets, a 
north-to-south distribution channel, and a platform for trading organic fruits and 
vegetables.
25.	 Continued support is also needed for existing GoK Projects such as the Rebuild Kerala 
initiative ‘Project on strengthening market network in Kerala’, procurement, trading 
& processing of jack fruit by VFPCK, market development activities of VFPCK, 
bulking points, collection centre, agro clinics, Vipani audit fee, SKS computerisation 
& maintenance, Vipaninet, MIC charges, support for post-harvest handling and value 
addition units, pack houses, sales promotion incentive, market intervention support, 
and common facility centre for farmer markets.
To conclude, if supported with necessary resources, these markets could play a key role in 
the promotion of vegetable cultivation to achieve the proposed goal of doubling vegetable 
production in Kerala in the next five years. Hence, providing necessary support to these 
markets is of paramount importance.

7. REFORMING EXISTING GOVERNMENT 
SCHEMES TO SUPPORT VEGETABLE PRODUCTION
Reforming existing schemes to improve vegetable production was discussed. The 
recommendations that evolved from the discussions are summarized below 
Cafeteria mode outlay with Flexi Funds 
The vegetable development programme is a prestigious programme of the department 
launched in the first year of the 12th five-year plan. The outlay provided for the scheme for 
the last 10 years are shown below

To bring more convergence and effectiveness to the schemes that are concerned with output 
delivery, a cafeteria model allocation is suggested. Department should have flexibility in 
reallocation between components. All the components could be categorized under two 
categories, viz., essential and optional. Optional components can be varied depending on 
the agroecological requirements for timely implementation.  Out of total outlay, 25 percent 
is suggested as flexi funds under optional components. Government of India has already 
adopted the flexi funds model in schemes.
Substantial Increase in Outlay
In order to double the production more marginal areas have to be brought under vegetable 
cultivation and the outlay must be more than doubled for meeting the target. The annual 
fund requirement is projected as Rs.150 crores and Rs.750 crore is projected over the 
14th five-year plan period for the modified VDP. More and more marginal lands must be 
cultivated where incremental output will be less, apart from technologies. Additional funds 
are required to sustain the production in such land.
State Planning Board
58
Inflation accounting in revision
Along with the increase in outlay, the assistance under different components may be revised 
once in three years to account for inflation. The practice of using old cost norms must be 
ended, and the cost of cultivation as well as other requirements must be accounted in the 
revision of assistance. 
Green book model approval
Similar to LSGD schemes, all the components under the VDP may be approved in April 
itself so that agricultural officers can link with local body schemes for more convergence. 
Some components are approved quite late and reach the Krishi bhavans after the season. 
To avoid that, department schemes also may be approved before April end. Necessary 
administrative systems must be put in place for this.
Physical targets
Scheme monitoring may be implemented with physical targets along with financial 
targets. Now, more focus is given for financial achievements without looking to physical 
achievements. More monitoring indicators may be developed for physical targets. 
Production planning
Production planning has not been attempted in vegetable production in a realistic manner. 
A new mode of implementation will be initiated with production planning. But the most 
important part is an expert group at the district level could be formed with statistical experts 
to guide the production planning process. Crop specialists as well as statisticians could be 
engaged in developing the production plan. A small budget provision of 5 lakhs per district 
is suggested as the requirement for production plan preparation 
Incentives in marketing
Incentives may be provided to farmers for marketing in cluster markets, along with transport 
support for transporting surplus produce in times of glut from one market to another. 
Suggested funding is about 2 lakhs per cluster with markets, preferably A grade clusters
Trader monitoring and incentivisation
Traders are not registered with markets at present. A new system of registration may be 
introduced for incentivizing the traders. Traders taking more quantities with maximum 
price will be incentivized. Norms will be prepared for this. An amount of Rs.25000 per 
cluster may be earmarked for this purpose
Non-lapsable procurement fund
Issues in marketing and difficulties in getting the amount due to the farmers from the 
procurement agencies were discussed in detail. Procedural issues often delay the payments 
for months together. Several farmers in Idukki have reportedly stopped vegetable cultivation 
due to this issue. To ease the situation, the procedure may be modified so that the amount 
could be deposited in Treasury itself but may be exempted from all treasury restrictions. 
Assured and incentivized procurement price
Assured price is the prerequisite for any production to sustain. A stable incentive 
procurement price may be introduced along with production increase. The base price is 
59
How Can Kerala Double Its Vegetable Production In The Next Five Years
only a crisis price. An incentivized procurement price is required to attract more farmers 
into vegetable cultivation.
Storage at decentralized level
Adequate capital investment is suggested for establishing cold storage and connected 
infrastructure under a professional management. Exact fund requirement may be worked 
out in subsequent meetings. The funds could be sourced from PACS or GOI. Professional 
management, networking, logistics etc. are more important in this initiative.
Interest-free credit
A major reform proposed is the establishment of a system to provide interest-free credit to 
farmers. As a token, an amount of Rs.10 crore is suggested to initiate the scheme.
Protection against wild animals
Human-animal conflict is a serious problem in several areas in the State. A separate budgetary 
provision may be made to arrange for the protection of crops from wild animals. Boundary 
protection, technology-based support and compensation are suggested as the components 
for the scheme. The infrastructure construction, boundary fencing, etc. should be on a 
participatory manner. An amount of Rs.50 crore may be provided to initiate the project.
Reform in expansion of New technologies:
Often, new technologies are introduced without sufficient background work. Before the 
introduction of technologies, the required technical documents should be prepared, and 
training should be provided. Quality monitoring of construction materials including those 
used in micro irrigation in the field should be provided independently. The beneficiary 
selection should be reformed and only interested beneficiaries need to be identified. A field 
report on rain shelters and poly houses may be prepared. New technologies like aquaponics, 
vertical farming, hydroponics, and aeroponics are to be introduced with all precautions and 
support systems. Excessively subsidy-oriented technology introduction may be discouraged
Inclusion of pests and diseases in crop insurance
Crop insurance for vegetables to be made more attractive by including protection from 
pests and diseases. The crop loss due to pests and diseases in vegetables is estimated at 
3.6 lakh tonnes. A major reworking of crop insurance scheme is needed to incorporate 
protection for pests and diseases. An amount of Rs.10 crore may be additionally provided 
for compensating the modified crop insurance under VDP. Detailed technical parameters 
could be worked out by an expert team.
Reforms through AIMS Portal
The DoA has decided to strengthen the prestigious AIMS portal. All assistance under VDP 
may be provided through AIMS portal for faster service delivery to beneficiaries.  Private 
portals are to be approached very carefully considering data security and other related 
issues. The possibility of developing AIMS portal for marketing must also be explored and 
expanded. Artificial intelligence and other modern IT technologies should be used under a 
Government-sponsored mechanism after putting in place the appropriate data security and 
data ownership agreements.
State Planning Board
60
Faster support response for natural calamities: 
Loss due to natural calamities are becoming a repetitive problem. Despite considerable 
crop loss owing to natural calamities for the last three years, compensation has been delayed 
in a number of cases. A mechanism may be delivered to provide NC assistance within a 
stipulated period of one or two months.
Lease land farming
More encouragement is required for promoting lease land farming. Even though leasing is 
illegal in Kerala, informal lease is widely practiced in food crops like vegetables, rice, and 
banana. Several problems have been reported in extending assistance to such farmers due 
to lack of documentation. Typically, the lease agreement is not shared by the landowners 
or there may be no lease agreement at all. A farmer-friendly certificate system must be 
introduced to those who cultivate crops on leased land. Moreover, the upper limit of 
extending assistance may be increased to 15 acres from 5 acres at present. In the base price 
scheme also, the upper limit of procurement has been enhanced from 5 acres to 15 acres. 
The same may be applied to lease-land farmers in extending assistance under the VDP.
Expansion of organic farming under certification and traceability
Organic farming practices like certified organic agriculture, safe-to-eat mode of production, 
Good Agricultural practices, Vrikshyurveda, and BPKP, are finding wide acceptance in 
Kerala. A certification authority may be formed under the DoA for the certification of 
organic agriculture. A traceability system must be introduced to ensure higher prices for 
the farmers. A higher price must also be ensured. A pricing scheme may be worked out 
to expand organic agriculture. KAU may provide a final package of practices for organic 
agriculture based on the State-of-the-art, and replace the ad hoc package of practices released 
more than 10 years ago. A marketing system also may be introduced for organic agriculture 
under a common brand name. An amount of Rs.15 crore is suggested as a budget support 
for these new initiatives.

8. REVIEW OF AIMS PORTAL; SCOPE FOR BLOCKCHAIN-ENABLED 
LOGISTICS AND INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPLY CHAIN BACKBONE 
FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE; SCOPE FOR 
AGRI-STARTUP MISSION
Agricultural Information Management System (AIMS) portal is a remarkable initiative by 
the Government of Kerala to provide many crucial services to the farming community in 
the State. It is effectively used to serve as a single window for data collection for planning 
and dissemination of information to a multitude of stakeholders, viz. farmers, policymakers, 
officials, traders, scholars, and the civil society.
Suggestions:
1.	
Despite its comparative effectiveness, the design of the AIMS portal needs improvement. 
The site has been noted to be very slow, particularly during the afternoons even when 
accessed by trained personnel. Uploads and OTP generation is also tedious. If the site 
is to be used to its full potential, the server capacity needs to be improved manifold.
2.	
User-friendliness must be ensured, keeping in mind that the portal targets farmers 
who may not be highly conversant with computers. AIMS kiosks may be installed at 
local Krishi Bhavans, VFPCK Markets, and other institutionalized markets with large 
screens and voice assistance. Short instructional videos, Aadhar-linked population of 
basic details, drop-down menus with ‘other’ option for additional information, and 
user-friendly scanning facilities for photographs and documents must be ensured. 
3.	
The information required should be minimized to what is strictly necessary, and there 
must be uniform requirements across the State. For instance, the lease land growers in 
the Malappuram district were exempted from submitting the tax receipts of the owners 
whereas many other farmers from other districts could not avail of the facility. 
4.	
When applying for claims, the cost of production, potential yield, ceiling, etc, need to 
be fixed more realistically. For instance, as of now, the potential yield of banana is fixed 
at 10 tonnes per ha which is far below the yield realized by a good farmer.
5.	
The market prices of the commodities need to be closely monitored and the declaration 
of price fall by the District Collector needs to be done without any delay. 
6.	
Submission of details from the bills of an institutional market is mandatory for claiming 
the base price. It could be simplified by linking the first entry in the market using a 
unique ID to the claim submission.  
7.	
Presently, claim submission is a long process and this needs to be simplified further. 
Claim settlement too, is delayed and steps are to be taken to address this issue. 
8.	
Appropriate and legally binding steps need to be taken to bring those farmers who 
cultivate in lands without title deed (Patta) under the coverage of the AIMS portal. 
As granting patta depends more on the State than the individual, these farmers who 
contribute considerably to agriculture, must be brought under the purview of such 
schemes.
9.	
An SMS update to the registered farmers is of utmost importance to ensure 
accountability and transparency. This will help them update themselves about their 
State Planning Board
62
stage of registration, application status of various services, submission of further 
documents, missing information, approvals, sanction, and disbursement of assistance. 
10.	 Once registered, reminders to the members could be sent through SMS with direct 
links for further actions such as registering their next crop or applying for the base 
price scheme. 
11.	 After the portal is made user-friendly and accessible to the majority of the farmers, 
farmers need to be incentivized enough to provide more data on the cost of 
production, reporting of pests and disease outbreaks, irrigation, harvest details, price 
realized, reporting price fall, etc. and they should be rewarded for doing so. This is of 
paramount importance in generating more reliable and updated data to feed into the 
policy-making process. 
12.	 The same data could be used for providing sales promotion incentives to the growers 
with additional incentive for mixed cropping and crop rotation, on top of the 
production incentives.  
13.	 The data thus generated should be made accessible to farmers, policymakers, officials, 
traders, scholars, and civil society while protecting the privacy of the registered growers. 
This could pave the way to the preparation of a production plan which could be able 
to address the issues of crop diversification and market glut, thus making a step further 
towards attaining the goal of economically viable, ecologically sound, and socially just 
agriculture.
BLOCKCHAIN-ENABLED LOGISTICS AND INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPLY CHAIN 
BACKBONE FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE IN KERALA
Introduction
The objectives of this scheme are
1.	
Assured markets and price realisation for farmers as the driver to increase production, 
area of cultivation and income of farmers of vegetables, fruits, and tuber crops.
2.	
Decentralised and assured procurement for every possible region in Kerala, with no 
farmer left without a procurement centre at their nearest proximity (ward level, at best) 
3.	
Enable all players – Government, LSGs, State marketing agencies, FPOs, PACs, 
Kudumbashree, farmers, farmer collectives and private vendors, by providing them 
with a professionally run, regulated and functioning logistics backbone and supply 
chain system to plug in, register and function as a producer, procurement agency, 
logistics operator and/or marketing agency.
4.	
Enable better demand mapping - area, crop, season and quantity wise, and help better 
crop planning, production and supply so as to avoid market failures either due to 
insufficiency or glut.
Proposed idea
Instead of State-assisted production support through schemes and subsidies, and a highly 
inadequate market support through State-run marketing agencies and shops, the proposal 
is to build, establish, and offer a professional end-to-end, blockchain-enabled logistics and 
infrastructure supply chain backbone for agricultural produce (mainly vegetables/fruits/
63
How Can Kerala Double Its Vegetable Production In The Next Five Years
tuber crops) in Kerala. This can have the following core elements from the top end to the 
bottom end 
- A centralised blockchain-enabled information management and control system (IMCS) 
with a registration and plug in option for producers, procurement agencies, logistics 
agencies, and end suppliers. Each of these types of users may be provided an app to plug 
into the system.
- A cold chain transport logistics, with long haul capability for inter district movement and 
short haul capability for local intra district movement. The cold chain transport logistics 
can be electric driven as much as is practically possible. All these logistics that may be run 
by various players should be connected to the IMCS. 
- A chain of cold storages established at the block or other appropriate level, and operated 
by various players, all connected to the IMCS.
- A local chain of smaller storage systems, as need be, at the panchayath level, based on 
assessment study and growth of production. Such storages may also be run by various 
players and are also connected to the IMCS. 
- Local (at best, ward level) centres/outlets that double as the procurement centre as well 
as sales outlet, to which registered farmers can go and deliver their produce, their produce 
checked for quality, weighed and data entered IMCS. These Local centres/shops may be 
setup and run by any of the above players, including local panchayaths.
Scheme of operations
Presently, we do not have any modern system that looks at agriculture marketing through the 
entire supply chain perspective. While the DAFW continues to run schemes that promote 
crop production, it should additionally enable the professional and technical upgradation 
including expanding the mandate of either the Horticorp or the VFPCK or facilitate a 
collaborative institution that should build and professionally run a backbone supply chain 
and IT infrastructure. 
The operation of the system may be described simply as below.
1.	
A farmer, whether they be large, small, marginalised or landless, should be able to 
register as a producer, if they have marketable surplus, and should be able to predict and 
enter the expected crop, quantity and approximate periods of supply, in an application 
like the AIMS that would be part of the IMCS. This leads to an estimate of crops and 
quantities in a season. Accordingly, the IMCS may designate a local centre to which 
the farmer can deliver their produce. This may be a centre nearest or most accessible to 
them, preferably in the ward where they have the farm/home. 
2.	
Local centres are agencies that may be setup by any of the Government, LSGs, any 
State-owned marketing agencies, FPOs, PACs, Kudumbashree, farmers, farmer 
collectives and private vendors. They can be the shops already functioning such as 
Horticorp, VFPCK, Eco shops etc. These are also to be registered with the IMCS and 
have an app to enter and process procurements and sales data.
3.	
Once the farmers bring their produce to a designated centre, the personnel in charge of 
State Planning Board
64
the local centre checks the quality of the produce, weigh and accept the produce. The 
data is entered in the app with the register number of the farmer. The farmer gets the 
payment at the Government fixed rates (MSP/Base price) within the stipulated period. 
The quantity of produce is added automatically to the block chain. The produce could 
get sold in their shop itself, and as it is done, the quantity is reduced from the central 
data base. The produce may also move further up the supply chain.
4.	
The produce that is available and needs storage would then move out through 
designated vehicles to one of the various levels of storage, at the panchayath/block 
levels for further onward supply according to demand.
5.	
At the demand side, the registered traders or any agency that wishes to procure and 
sell the produce may register and raise their demands prior itself, and depending on 
availability, the produce gets organised at the storage/organising yards and the products 
are delivered  to the demand side agencies upon payment. 
6.	
A stock taking and specific sale strategies for items that remain beyond a certain period 
may then be taken at the Block/ District or State level depending on the nature and 
quantity of the produce.
Considerations 
1.	
The system needs a professional, technically sound, modern management agency with 
good HR and trouble shooting skills. Such a team needs to be handpicked, trained, 
and deployed.
2.	
Blockchain technology is a time tested one for supply chain management. It has its 
costs but in terms of building transparency and full chain traceability, adopting this 
could be critical.
3.	
Instead of looking for a new institution to run the system, we can upgrade either 
the Horticorp or the VFPCK, or have a collaborative body that runs the system. 
Alternatively, it may also be entrusted to a professional agency, which has proven 
standards and experience.
Way forward 
This proposal cannot be fully implemented at a go, and needs very careful evaluation, 
planning, designing, some restructuring, institution building and execution, preferably 
with pilot projects and then gradual expansion to the whole State. 
Before a DPR is prepared, we may generate a virtual model based on available data for a 
district and do virtual runs to be convinced of having such a model. This can adopt the 
blockchain technology so that the software system is also tested. Such a model can be 
developed with the help of available resources in Kerala, such as engineering students, KAU 
etc.
The preparation of a DPR with a clear ToR may be entrusted to an agency of repute and 
experience. 
Resources
A well-prepared DPR with estimates and field level time-lined action plans will help raise 
65
How Can Kerala Double Its Vegetable Production In The Next Five Years
resources for this ambitious project. One can look for resources from various sources, 
including plan funds, infrastructure investment budget through NABARD refinancing, 
equity contributions from major players in the supply chain or from individual investors, 
like in the CIAL model, KIIFB borrowings, or even an ambitious attempt at the World 
Bank fundings. 
Endnote
In this era of cutting-edge technology, drones, artificial intelligence and machine learning, 
etc., one might wonder why these technology barely benefit farms and farmers. Even today, 
farmers work the earth against all odds including weather and financial constraints, and 
then wait for an almost non-functional and arbitrary market system, that even if it works, 
never pays them a remunerative price. Farmers and entrepreneurs need to submit hard copy 
documents every time they apply for benefits. It is time that we automate such systems, 
and the best place to start is to make “Ease of Farming and Marketing” as that State policy.
The automation of agriculture offices is a welcome mover, but it is of no use if the services 
of such automated system does not positively and effectively make life easier for the farmers. 
It would be apt to allow the process to start at the most needed market access and price 
realisation, so that even while the income of the farmers improve, the production could be 
doubled, as is the goal. 
SCOPE OF KERALA AGRI START-UP MISSION
An Agri startup mission is primarily geared to address the needs of early starters, innovators, 
motivated young farmers, and entrepreneurs in the rural and agriculture field. It has the 
following objectives.
1.	
To pro-actively scout for, identify, mentor, and incubate individuals/groups, potential 
Start-ups, with planning, management, technology, training, financial hand holding 
and other needs to make them evolve into viable and successful rural/agri entrepreneurs.
2.	
To ensure case-by-case needs assessment and need-based support for potential startups/ 
entrepreneurs in rural/agri field and facilitate/mentor their growth.
3.	
To build quality in agri produce, larger reach of organised collective/cooperative 
production, processing and market support and better realisation of farmer-level 
income. 
Proposed idea
Presently, any person/group entering the field of agriculture with a vision that involves not 
just farming but the building of their own enterprise around it, must follow the same pattern 
of rigidly fixed schemes, becoming beneficiaries through the DoA system, approaching and 
negotiating with finance agencies and banks, meeting serious roadblocks and in the process 
of building such an enterprise, becoming fatigued. While technology support is available, 
access is still limited with no professionally managed agency to bridge the gaps. 
A one-stop centre, a professionally managed Kerala agri start-up mission, with both 
centralised and regional expertise, and whose mandate is to identify and enable the growth of 
agri start-ups and enterprises is the need of the time. This can have the following operations 
State Planning Board
66
1.	
A professional agency, the Kerala agri-start-up mission with regional centres/agencies 
franchised/directly run, with expertise in agriculture field level enterprise building, 
planning, management, training, technology linking, financial linking and marketing.
2.	
The agency can run skills programmes, scouting and identification exercises, incubation 
and launch pad schemes, mentoring and training programmes, as well as long term 
support programmes.
3.	
The agency would handhold the identified group through its incubation and fledgling 
stages, till it matures to a self-reliant enterprise.

9. SUMMARY
14TH FIVE YEAR PLAN – PROPOSAL FOR VEGETABLES
Critical gaps in formulation and implementation of schemes during 13th plan
•	
Lack of integration between agencies, DoA, VFPCK, Horticorp, and LSGs in the 
implementation of vegetable development schemes. 
•	
Inadequate mechanism to assure the quality and supply of seeds, grafted seedlings, 
bioinputs, limited use of Agromet advisory service, poor adoption of soil test based 
fertilizer application.
•	
Inadequate storage, transport, and marketing support.
•	
Lack of AEU-based crop production and marketing plan; no production plan or 
staggered crop production for daily supply to potential markets
•	
Incomplete database about farmers and local vegetable production. Potential of IOT 
not exploited.
•	
No proper support for farmers cultivating on leased land
•	
Identification of beneficiary and distribution of assistance is based on area and not on 
production
•	
Lack of continued support for farmers availing assistance under protected cultivation.
•	
No convergence mechanism to accommodate social organizations involved in vegetable 
cultivation. 
Proposal for Vegetable Sector in Kerala : 14th five year plan
1.	 Promote commercial vegetable cultivation in potential AEUs (1,2,3,8,9,10,11,12,13, 
17,18,20,21,22,23) through cluster approach to increase the production of vegetables 
from 15.7 lakh tones in 2019-20  to 31.4 lakh tones by  end of the 14th Five Year 
Plan. Adopt location specific production protocol with respect to season of cultivation, 
soil management, selection of varieties/hybrids, stress management, harvesting and 
marketing. The production potential in each AEU should be identified and target-based 
production based on the 15 AEUs should be planned accordingly. The production of 
vegetables should be targeted according to the potential of each locality, such that there 
will not be any excess production of a single vegetable which can result in market glut.
2.	 More emphasis should be given to the attainment of the physical plan target than the 
financial plan at the field level. A road map for the formulation of a production plan 
needs to be done for staggered vegetable farming, not only in commercial fields but 
also in the homesteads and institutions. Explore the feasibility of establishing “market 
intelligence” centres to provide an idea of the possibility of the potential crop which the 
farmers can grow in the coming season to fetch maximum price in markets. 
3.	 Promote scientific organic farming that stresses safe-to-eat vegetables. A campaign to 
“Eat local food” needs to be popularised to ensure the marketing of farmers’ produce 
via responsible branding. Promote kitchen gardens with a thrust on organic farming 
and waste recycling. Functioning of pesticide residue detection labs in three zones of 
Kerala should be strengthened for detecting the presence of new pesticide molecules in 
vegetables.
State Planning Board
68
4.	 Adopt a comprehensive policy for popularizing hybrids/HYVs with respect to seed 
source,  nutrient schedule, training, pruning, and pest management. Promote cultivation 
of market- friendly vegetables like seedless watermelon, coleus, hot chilli, beans and 
cauliflower among commercial growers after identifying potential AEUs.  Quality of 
Seeds marketed by Private seed companies should be regulated. Independent agency 
should be entrusted for seed testing to ensure quality of seed produced by farmers as 
well as by different agencies. 
5.	 State/District seed production plan may be prepared for seed and planting material 
production and marketing involving/linking various agencies including KAU, VFPCK, 
DoA, NSC, and identified private seed companies. Promote participatory farmer seed 
production in self pollinated crops like cowpea.  Functioning of farms under State 
DoA may be improved through purchase of nucleus seeds of new varieties, improving 
infrastructure facilities of the farms/nurseries for enhancing quantity and quality of 
planting materials etc. Assist seed multiplication and popularization of new varieties of 
vegetables released by KAU. Establish a State level seed certification agency as envisaged 
in Seed Act.
6.	 Promote nutrigarden concept in all households and flats with a stress on rain shelter 
vegetable production, terrace farming, vertical garden, container cultivation, and 
promoting Panchamam in nutrigardens with a minimum of five crops, viz, moringa, 
chilli, curry leaf, cow pea and papaya. 
7.	 Popularise rain shelter, low-cost polyhouse, and net-house cultivation of vegetables so 
that crops like salad cucumber, yard-long bean, grafted chilli, and cherry tomato can be 
grown.  Establishment of shade net-house nurseries is to be encouraged for the supply 
of seedlings and grafted seedlings, and such nurseries may be recognized by the State 
DoA. Grafted seedlings may be used in the case of hybrids and units at the block level 
may be trained for the production of grafted seedlings. 
8.	 Promote soil test-based fertilizer application for commercial farming with a thrust on 
INM. Ensure soil testing as a part of all production schemes and promote campaign 
approach for periodic soil testing with the participation and coordination of all agencies. 
Establish three referral labs for detailed soil testing. Promote ready-to-use mixtures like 
Sampoorna, and Ayar.
9.	 Agromet advisory services should be improved with location-specific bulletins for each 
AEU and farmers may be selected and involved in data collection and dissemination of 
weather-based advisory service.  
10.	Popularise open precision farming, mechanization with emphasis on solar pump sets 
and solar-based fencing to prevent the attack of wild animals in vegetable-growing 
clusters. Promote polyhouse vegetable cultivation in appropriate areas with continuous 
training and assistance to farmers.   Adopt modern techniques like hydroponics, 
aquaponics, vertical farming in urban and semi urban clusters.
11.	Adopt IPM, biocontrol agents such as Trichogramma, Trichoderma, Pseudomonas, 
Piriformospora, new botanicals, neem soap, Pongamia soap, pheromone traps, other 
types of traps, ecological engineering- promote marigold cultivation once in a year in 
69
How Can Kerala Double Its Vegetable Production In The Next Five Years
commercial growing tracts, adopt non-host plant cultivation, explore newer pesticide 
molecules with low toxicity, promote pesticide literacy. On-farm production of 
bioagents should be promoted in each cluster. Implement crop insurance against the 
incidence of identified pest and diseases beyond a threshold level.
12.	Research should be focused on development of high quality hybrids and varieties, 
pest and disease resistance. Tapping potential of modern technology, addressing the 
challenge of climate change, conservation of local vegetable gene pool, promoting 
biological control in stress management, new value addition protocol for popular 
vegetables. Tropical vegetable research centre should be established to coordinate and 
prioritize vegetable research.  
13.	Promote convergence involving  DoA, VFPCK, Horticorp, LSGs and Kudumbashree, 
and integration of the roles and responsibilities of all the stake holders pooling all the 
available resources at various levels of LSGIs. A three-tier production plan of vegetables 
involving panchayat-level support for the arrangement of seeds, planting materials, 
and production inputs, block-level support for procurement as well as marketing and 
district-level support for value addition of the products should be followed. 
14.	There should be a professionally managed, IT-enabled decentralized procurement and 
marketing system, and this should ensure remunerative price to the producers. The huge 
potential of FPOs/FPCs and co-operatives should be exploited in the next five years 
in the field of procurement, value addition, and marketing of vegetables. Necessary 
changes should be incorporated in the project guidelines to achieve these objectives of 
increasing production, productivity, sustainability, employment generation and income 
increase of vegetable farmers.
15.	More schemes should be devised on FLD for advanced technologies like aeroponics, 
hydroponics, and vertical farming, bee keeping : technology may be adapted and 
tested from research institutes  before popularising: after successful field testing using 
schemes during the first three or four seasons, schemes may be devised for assistance to 
beneficiaries on such technologies 
16.	Production linked subsidy and separate assistance may form part of the subsidy schemes 
(differential subsidy rates for cucurbits/cool season vegetables/leafy vegetables). Improve 
assistance to Commercial Cultivation of Vegetables (cluster) by 25 to 50% from current 
rate. Bring farmers cultivating in lease land also under subsidy regime.
17.	Assistance to production of State plan projects may be increased by availing more funds 
from MIDH/CSS schemes. Promote INM, Agromet bulletins, Pesticide literacy and 
post harvest management in campaign mode using Krishi Paadashala
18.	Procurement and marketing of vegetables should be streamlined by defining clear roles 
to Horticorp, VFPCK and DoA. For handling farmer’s produce, establish hygienically 
designed and easily cleanable district procurement with sufficient storage capacity in 
each district. Install cold storage facilities for highly perishable commodities at Idukki, 
Palghat, and Wayanad. Establish retail outlets in every LSG all over Kerala with the 
help of LSGI and Primary Co-operative Societies. Promote temperature-controlled 
supply chain facilities linked with district procurement centres in all municipalities

and corporations. Establish processing centres at production clusters with the help of 
Primary Co-operative Societies. 
19.	Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK), with a network of 290 
Farmers’ Markets (Swasraya Karshaka Samithi, SKS) handles over one lakh MT of 
produce worth 250‒300 crores annually. As group marketing involves bulking the 
farm produce at a single point, providing infrastructure support to these markets is of 
paramount importance. Those areas, where there exists an already established VFPCK 
market, shall be avoided while initiating any new State-funded market, or such markets 
could be integrated with the existing VFPCK market. Channelling all the financial 
support for fruits and vegetables through these farmer markets based on the quantity 
traded would ensure accountability and transparency. VFPCK is primarily involving in 
wholesale and by providing linkages to other State-organized ventures like Supplyco, 
Consumerfed, PDS, and mid-day meals, etc., and with logistic support to the council, 
a substantial share of these produce from the farmers’ markets could be distributed to 
the consumers at a reasonable price. FPOs could be effectively utilized for organizing 
this. Moreover, it should be a priority to develop the online under the Thalir brand. 
Though it has initiated export activities, it could be made a profitable venture only if 
rejections could be managed through branded outlets. Modernization of these markets 
with computerization and high-speed internet is necessary with the technological 
change. All these need to be done in a mission mode assessing the realistic quantity of 
production and demand in the market. To ensure that the farmers continue to take up 
vegetable cultivation as a profitable and sustainable venture, and to ensure their welfare, 
the pricing in all platforms involved in the trading of the produce needs to be regulated 
through State legislation.   
20.	Cafeteria model allocation is suggested to bring more convergence and effectiveness of 
schemes in output delivery. All the components could be categorized as either essential 
or optional. Out of total outlay, 25 percent is suggested as flexi funds under the 
optional components. More than double the outlay is required for meeting the target 
of doubling vegetable production. The annual fund requirement is projected as Rs.150 
crores. Along with the increase in outlay, the assistance under different components may 
be revised once in three years to account for inflation. Similar to LSGD schemes, all 
the components under the VDP may be approved in April itself similar to green book 
model. A new mode of implementation may be initiated with production planning.
21.	Incentives may be provided to farmers for participation in cluster markets as well as a 
transport support for transporting surplus produce from one market to another in times 
of glut. A new system of registration of traders may be introduced for incentivizing 
them. Traders taking more quantities with maximum price may be incentivized. 
Assured price is the prerequisite for any production to sustain. A stable incentivized 
procurement price may be introduced along with production increase and the creation 
of a non-lapsable procurement fund for assured payment for the farmers.
22.	A major reform is proposed to provide interest free credit to farmers. A major scheme 
is suggested for the protection of crop from wild animal attack. Crop insurance for 
71
How Can Kerala Double Its Vegetable Production In The Next Five Years
vegetables to be made more attractive by including pests and diseases also. Often 
new technologies are introduced without sufficient background work. Before the 
introduction of technologies, relevant technical documents should be prepared and 
personnel should be trained. More encouragement for promoting lease-land farming is 
required. In lease-land farming a farmer-friendly certificate system must be introduced 
to help engage more farmers. Similarly, the upper limit of extending assistance may be 
increased to 15 acres from the current 5 acres with adequate budget provision. 
23.	All assistance under VDP may be provided through the AIMS portal, which needs 
to be revamped, for faster service delivery to beneficiaries.  Private portals are to be 
approached very carefully considering the data security and other connected issues. 
The possibility of developing the AIMS portal for marketing also to be explored and 
expanded. 
24.	Different modes of organic farming are gaining popularity in the State. A certification 
authority may be formed under the DoA for the certification of organic agriculture. 
Export potential of ethnic vegetables under organic branding should be explored. 
25.	Explore the scope of establishing a professional, end-to-end, blockchain-enabled 
logistics and infrastructure supply chain backbone for agricultural produce (mainly 
vegetables/fruits/tuber crops) in Kerala.  Promote Agri startups.

ANNEXURE II
New technologies for vegetable crop production
Hydroponics 
Hydroponics is a technology for growing plants in nutrient solutions (water and fertilizers) 
with or without the use of an artificial medium (e.g. sand, gravel, vermiculite, rockwool, 
peat moss, sawdust) to provide mechanical support. Liquid hydroponic systems have no 
other supporting medium for the plant roots; aggregate systems have a solid medium of 
support. Hydroponic systems are further categorized as open (i.e., once the nutrient solu­
tion is delivered to the plant roots, it is not reused) or closed (i.e., surplus solution is recov­
ered, replenished, and recycled). 
The principal advantages of hydroponics include high crop yield, crop production where 
no suitable soil exists, more efficient use of water and fertilizers, minimal use of land area, 
and suitability for mechanization and disease control. A major advantage of hydroponics, as 
compared with growth of plants in soil, is the isolation of the crop from the underlying soil, 
which often has problems associated with disease, salinity, or poor structure and drainage. 
The costly and time consuming tasks of soil sterilization and cultivation are unnecessary 
in hydroponic systems and a rapid turnaround of crops is readily achieved. Because of its 
significantly higher costs, successful applications of hydroponic technology are limited to 
crops of high economic value, to specific regions, and often to specific times of the year 
when comparable OFA crops are not readily available. Repeated pricing studies have shown 
that only high-quality, garden-type vegetables viz., tomatoes, cucumbers, and specialty let­
tuce can provide breakeven or better revenues in hydroponic systems. These vegetables 
along with eggplant, peppers, melons, strawberries and herbs are grown commercially in 
hydroponic systems.  
Different hydroponic systems
Two different hydroponic systems are used to produce vegetables: the gravel flow, or re-cir­
culating system, and the open bag, or drain to waste system.
In the drain-to-waste (open bag) system, plants are grown in containers and nutrient solu­
tion is supplied to plants by means of a dripper, for up to 12 times per day. The number of 
irrigation cycles per day depends on temperature and the growth stage of plants. The crops 
in the drain to waste system grow tall and need to be trained and pruned so that they grow 
upwards as a single stem.
In the gravel flow system, the nutrient solution is re-circulated and the roots of the plants 
stand in a thin film of nutrient solution all the time. Gravel or sand is used most often as 
growth medium. A PG project in KAU attempted to standardize the technique of hydro­
ponic cultivation of tomato in a rain shelter. The experiment was laid out with 13 treat­
ments comprising of two hydroponic methods: a) Deep Flow Technique, b) Ebb and Flow 
Technique; two nutrient solutions: a) Cooper’s solution, b) Hoagland’s solution and three 
growing media: a) coco peat, b) expanded clay pellets, c) pebbles and a control where the 
plants were grown in soil with POP recommendations. The results showed that plants in 
75
How Can Kerala Double Its Vegetable Production In The Next Five Years
soil with POP recommendations showed superiority for plant height, days to first flower 
appearance, days to first fruit set, days to first harvest, fruits per plant, duration of the 
crop, number of harvests, yield per plant, and average fruit weight over the hydroponic 
treatments. Among the hydroponic treatments, F2S1M1, (a combination of Ebb and Flow 
Technique, Cooper’s solution and coco peat) was the best with respect to growth, yield per 
plant, and benefit-cost ratio . The yield per unit area was also high for this treatment and 
this was on par with the plants grown in soil. Out of the two nutrient solutions tested, 
Cooper’s solution was significantly better. The growth and yield parameters were signifi­
cantly influenced by the growing media and were the best in coco peat, followed by pebbles.
Aeroponics. This is a form of hydroponics. Nutrient and water mixture is sprayed in caged 
roots under dark at certain intervals with the help of sensors. This conserves water, space 
and is less cumbersome. It demands constant supervision and has disadvantages as listed 
under hydroponics.
Aquaponics. Involves production of fish and vegetables with same input resource of water 
and nutrients. Feed is given to the fishes in the pond not to the vegetables or plants grown as 
hydroponics. Fish pond or tank water is used  as hydroponics or aeroponics with or without 
additional fertigation. This results in effective utilization of fish pond water and its nutrients 
for production of vegetables/plants simultaneously with added returns on input resources. 
Plants  act as biofilter for the recycled water to fish pond.
VERTICAL FARMING
Vertical farming generally refers to the growing of crops - mostly vegetables, ornamentals, 
and herbs on stacks of indoor shelves using artificial light and nutrient solutions, without 
much sunshine and soil. Such farms are not dependent  on seasons/controlled environ­
ment and have ability to enhance production round  the year with little risk of crop fail­
ure. Further, they give fresh quality produce  without the need for a favourable climate, 
healthy soil, and high water consumption, and above all, saves on labour, which is a scarce 
commodity today. Vertical farming has  the  potential to sustain the ever-increasing world 
population especially in the urban areas, thus providing food security. Vertical production 
of mushrooms, hydroponic green fodder, some vegetables and fruits and even  poultry birds 
are either in practice already or at an advanced stage of practice. 
Green, living, or bio walls 
These are used in ornamental horticulture. These are comprised of a free-standing space or 
part of a building that is partially or completely covered with attractive vegetation luxuri­
antly growing in an organic or inorganic medium and in some cases, soil also. 
Sky greens – the world’s first hydraulic driven vertical farm
The Singapore-based company Sky Greens has developed a revolutionary vertical farming 
system which is also the world’s first low carbon, hydraulic-driven farm. The vegetables are 
planted on shelves that keep on rotating throughout the day. For garden walls, selection of 
suitable plants is the single most important factor in its success. Plants thriving well in local 
climate are the best option. Besides, they should have compact growth providing thick and 
dense cover. Plants having short growth habit, shallow fibrous root system and longer life

cycle are best suited for this purpose. They also need to be capable of coping both full sun 
and full shade according to the location. 
Important Features of Vertical Farming
Vertical farms enable the producer to:
• Grow food 24 hours a day, 365 days a year
• Protect crops from unpredictable and harmful weather
• Re-use of water collected from the indoor environment
• Provide jobs for residents/communities
• Minimize use of pesticides/fertilizers/ herbicides
• Drastic reduction and dependence on fossil fuels
• Prevent crop loss from storage/shipping/ long transportation
• Stop agricultural runoff, water saving up to 90% 
TERRACE GARDENING
Best containers to grow crops
Based on experiments done at IFSRS, KAU with cowpea, bhindi, chilli, brinjal, Amaranthus, 
and cabbage, it was found that the best container for growing vegetables is plastic sack with 
60 cm height and 45 cm diameter capable of holding 20-24 kg potting media. The greater 
volume of growing media results in better root proliferation and yield when compared to 
earthen pot, uv stabilized grow bag and polythene bags. Moreover, the small pores of the 
sack permits better aeration of the potting media and root zone. However, it has a durability 
of 1-1 ½ years only. 
The cost of a good plastic sack ranges from Rs.18-20/-. 
Regarding durability, UV stabilized grow bags were found to be durable for 2-2 ½ years and 
costs only Rs.15 per bag.
Low-cost drip irrigation system
Based on trials with Amaranthus and bhindi it was found that crop yield under drip irriga­
tion was significantly higher than conventional irrigations.  The water use was 39 per cent 
more under conventional irrigation when compared to the low-cost drip system. Water 
productivity was 80-85 per cent more under the low-cost drip irrigation system. An entire 
unit of the drip irrigation system, comprising of 100 m length of pipe, connectors filter etc. 
costs Rs.849/- only and is manufactured by Jain Irrigation Systems (Jain Drip Kit) (IFSRS, 
2014).

The positive effect of rock dust is evident and can be attributed to the micronutrient  pres­
ent in it besides trace amounts of major and secondary nutrients(based on chemical analy­
sis). Hence, it can be considered for use as a substitute for sand which is difficult to obtain. 
Moreover, rock dust (Rs.2/- per kg) is cheaper than sand.
Foliar fertilization vis-a-vis fertilization as per the package of practices recommendations
In Amaranthus and brinjal, higher yield was obtained by adopting fertilization as per the 
Package of practices recommendations, while in bhindi and bush cowpea significantly high­
er yield was obtained with foliar fertilization (19:19:19 @ 5 g litre-1 +0.5 ml Stanowet). 
Applying of  inorganic fertilizers to the soil in the grow bag will leach out along with irriga­
tion water and react with the cement floor of the terrace, which will in the long run damage 
the terrace. Hence, this practice has to be dispensed with on terraces. It is in this context 
that, foliar fertilization assumes importance. In foliar fertilization the inorganic fertilizer 
does not come in contact with the terrace floor and results in reasonably good yield.
